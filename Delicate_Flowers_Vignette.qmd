# Growing in Harsh Conditions: A Study of Confederate Women during the Civil War

### Addison Horton — Hist 8510 — Spring 2024

Early in the semester, I came across a number of diaries written by Confederate women during the American Civil War. I was excited about the prospect of using this material but quickly realized that it was far too large a corpus for me to read in its entirety in the span of a few months. So, I did what any digital historian would do and turned to digital tools. Through word vector analysis and topic modeling, I was able to identify age as a crucial consideration when studying elite white women's reactions to the war.

#### Prepping the Data

The first thing I did was load the necessary packages for word vector analysis and topic modeling.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext) 
library(readtext)
library(widyr)
library(SnowballC)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(readtext)
library(tm)
library(topicmodels)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
devtools::install_github("bmschmidt/wordVectors")
library(wordVectors)
library(tidyverse)
```

The corpus for this work consists of 14 Civil War diaries, written by elite Confederate white women. They are not representative of all Southern women, yet this study is still valuable for understanding the complexities of women's wartime experience. It is commonly held that the Civil War was a three front war, but these personal writings suggest that these women's homes served as a fourth. While men fought on the battlefield, Confederate women fought the “domestic war.”[^delicate_flowers_vignette-1]

```{r}
#zip file of all the .txt files. One for each month of diary entries. 
unzip("diary-txt.zip")

# Metadata that includes info about each month of diary entries.
diary.metadata <- read.csv("Meta-Grid view.csv")

#reading in the data
file_paths <- list.files("text files/")
diary_texts <- readtext(paste("text files/", "*.txt", sep = ""))

#joining the data
diary_whole <- full_join(diary.metadata, diary_texts, by = c("file_name" = "doc_id")) %>% as_tibble()
```

The stop words list for this data is rather lengthy, as months, days, and most proper names not belonging to political figures or prominent military personnel were removed.

```{r}
stop_words_custom <- stop_words %>% add_row(word="january", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="february", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="march", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="april", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="may", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="june", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="july", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="august", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="septmeber", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="october", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="november", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="december", lexicon="NA")  %>% add_row(word="day", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="december", lexicon="NA")  %>% add_row(word="morning", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="december", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="evening", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="december", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="miriam", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="december", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="miriam", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="home", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="phil", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="chesnut", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="willie", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="mary", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="yesterday", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="time", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="laura", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="lou", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="kate", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="charlie", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="anna", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="grimball", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="william", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="gibbes", lexicon="NA") %>% add_row(word="bettie", lexicon="NA")


diary_whole_unnest <- diary_whole %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)  %>% 
 filter(str_detect(word, "[a-z']$"))  %>%
  anti_join(stop_words_custom)# eliminates stop words 

diary.dtm <- diary_whole_unnest %>% 
  count(file_name, word) %>% 
  cast_dtm(file_name, word, n)
```

### Reading the Texts

In order to responsibly text mine this data, I had to ground myself in the text. For me, this meant reading a number of the diaries in my corpus cover to cover to get a feel for what they talked about, how they felt, etc. I was immediately struck by the brazen defiance of some of these women. Consider, for instance, Sarah Morgan Dawson. She lived in Louisiana during the war, and, when the Union army took New Orleans, she immediately established a plan for how she would combat her enemy. When they ordered that "all devices, signs, and flags of the Confederacy shall be suppressed," she responded with a resolve to make new ones. And when those were taken, she would make even more. If they tried to remove the flag she kept pinned to her chest, "the man who dares attempt it - well! a pistol in my pocket fills up the gap."[^delicate_flowers_vignette-2] Dawson saw herself as an active participant in the war effort and was willing to resort to physical violence in the name of the Confederacy. On many occurrences, the war excited her.

### Word Vector Analysis

Word vector analysis seemed like the obvious choice to distantly view this corpus. Each of these women had a unique writing style and their own preferred vocabularies. Additionally, Southern white women were accustomed to using euphemisms to discuss delicate topics, such as sex.[^delicate_flowers_vignette-3] Word vectors promised to mitigate these complications.

[^delicate_flowers_vignette-3]: E. Susan Barber and Charles F. Ritter, “Dangerous Liaisons: Working Women and Sexual Justice in the American Civil War.” European journal of American studies 10, no. 1 (March 26, 2015).

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Need to wrap these in an if statement so that if the file generated exists, it doesn't rerun the model, it just loads the model file (.txt or .bin respectively)
prep_word2vec(origin="text files",destination="textfiles.txt",lowercase=T,bundle_ngrams=1)

model = train_word2vec("textfiles.txt","textfiles.bin",vectors=400,threads=6,window=12,iter=3,negative_samples=5)
```

In order to limit my results to *women's* experiences, I fed the model feminine terms and told it reject masculine ones. The results were surprising. The first fourteen words that appear, most notably "moan," "tear," "weep," "hush," "sobs," "shrill," "lone," "sacrificed," and "screams," carry a disheartened connotation. This aligns with the tone of Margaret Ann Meta Morris Grimball’s diary, which I also read, but not Dawson's or Emma LeConte's. The fourteenth word to appear in this model, "patriotic," is what I expected to find. Why were Dawson and LeConte's voices suppressed with this method?

```{r}
wowords <- model[[c("female", "females", "women", "woman", "feminine", "she", "woman's")]] %>% reject(model[[c("male", "males", "men", "man", "masculine", "he", "men's")]])
model %>% nearest_to(wowords, 100)

```

### Topic Modeling

I ran into the same problem when I attempted to topic model the corpus. The results were logical but they did not align with what I expected to find – defiance, disdain for the Union, and courage.

```{r}
diary.lda <- LDA(diary.dtm, k = 15, control = list(seed = 12345), method = "Gibbs", alpha = .7)
diary.lda

diary.topics <- tidy(diary.lda, matrix = "beta")
head(diary.topics)

diary.top.terms <- diary.topics %>%
  arrange(desc(beta)) %>% 
  group_by(topic) %>% slice(1:8)


diary.top.terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered()
```

### The Missing Piece

At this point it was clear that I was missing something. Age.

When the Civil War started in 1861, Dawson and LeConte, our poster-children of Confederate women’s bravery, were both teenagers. LeConte was thirteen and Dawson nineteen. Leconte discussed how pivotal these years of life were and described wartime as a “hard school to be bred up in.”[^delicate_flowers_vignette-4] Nevertheless, her dedication to the War effort was stronger and her attitude better than her older counterparts, such as Grimball, whose diary was ridden with anxious thoughts. She was in her fifties when the war started, and she worried for her sons, her health, and the state of her home. When she was asked to be “one of the managers to the Aid Society,” an effort dedicated to clothing Confederate troops and providing relief to the wounded, she declined.[^delicate_flowers_vignette-5] Dawson and LeConte, contrarily, responded to any kind of participation with an eager enthusiasm. By splitting my corpus into two distinct categories by age, I was able to conclude that this phenonemon was not limited to Dawson, LeConte, and Grimball.

Each of the topic models below was created using seven Confederate women’s diaries. The first looks at women who were 21 years old or younger when the war started, and the second looks at women who were 26 or older. Although Southern women often married young, in my corpus those under 21 years of age were unmarried. There are more topics in the first model because the young women in this particular sample wrote more than their older counterparts. 

```{r}
diary_young <- diary_whole_unnest %>% filter(name == "Sarah Morgan Dawson" | name == "Eliza Frances Andrews" | name == "Belle Edmondson" | name == "Emma LeConte" | name == "Sarah Lois Wadley" | name == "Kate S. Carney" | name == "Susan R. Jervey")

diary.dtm <- diary_young %>% 
  count(file_name, word) %>% 
  cast_dtm(file_name, word, n)

diary.lda <- LDA(diary.dtm, k = 13, control = list(seed = 12345),  method = "Gibbs", alpha = .5)
diary.lda

diary.topics <- tidy(diary.lda, matrix = "beta")
head(diary.topics)

diary.top.terms <- diary.topics %>%
  arrange(desc(beta)) %>% 
  group_by(topic) %>% slice(1:8)


diary.top.terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered()
```

```{r}
diary_old <- diary_whole_unnest %>% filter(name == "Dolly Sumner Lunt" | name == "Anita Dwyer Withers" | name == "Mary Boykin Chesnut" | name == "Meta Morris Grimball" | name == "Frances Woolfolk Wallace" | name == "Mary Jeffreys Bethell" | name == "Julia Johnson Fisher")

diary.dtm <- diary_old %>% 
  count(file_name, word) %>% 
  cast_dtm(file_name, word, n)

diary.lda <- LDA(diary.dtm, k = 9, control = list(seed = 12345),  method = "Gibbs", alpha = .9)
diary.lda

diary.topics <- tidy(diary.lda, matrix = "beta")
head(diary.topics)

diary.top.terms <- diary.topics %>%
  arrange(desc(beta)) %>% 
  group_by(topic) %>% slice(1:8)


diary.top.terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered()
```

The topics in Topic Model 1, on the whole, have a more positive connotation. We see words like “hope,” “happy,” “glad,” and “beautiful” appearing in multiple topics. Whether they were discussing activities at home, as we see in Topic 7, or travel as seen in Topic 13, these girls were not overcome with dread. In Topic Model 2, contrarily, we see words like “poor,” “lost,” “dead,” and “wounded” occurring frequently. This is not to say that positive words never appear in Topic Model 2 or negative words in Topic Model 1, but, overall, each topic model has a different tone. This is most evident when comparing a similar topic in each model. Topic Model 1 Topic 1 and Topic Model 2 Topic 2, for instance, could both be labeled “War.”

Across the corpus, younger women talked about hope and peace when they discussed the war (per image 1) while older women focused on the wounded and the killed (per image 2). This specific observation is not something that you would immediately notice while reading the texts, but it stands to reason that younger women, who were more enthusiastic about the war effort, would have been more sanguine when discussing it. Whereas the older women, who felt greater pressure to restrain themselves, felt more defenseless and, therefore, lamented their circumstances.

### Why? 

Bertram Wyatt-Brown’s evaluation of Southern girlhood helps to explain this variation. From birth to “the boys’ ‘clothing’ stage,” around the age of four, girls were raised without much “sexual differentiation” from their peers. This meant that “they too were indulged, fretted over, and given every opportunity to make demands.”[^delicate_flowers_vignette-6] Boys and girls were the same. In the next phase of development, while they were still quite young, girls continued to enjoy “a degree” of indulgence. The societal structures of control had begun working on them, but this is when fathers taught their daughters to ride horses, handle firearms, and even hunt.[^delicate_flowers_vignette-7] This all changed “abruptly” as soon as girls reached menarche, or the first occurrence of menstruation. Almost in a moment, they were forced to “recognize their vulnerability to male aggression.”[^delicate_flowers_vignette-8] As Southern women aged, they began to actively reinforce the standards that men established for them – such as modesty, prudence, and purity.[^delicate_flowers_vignette-9]

These considerations serve to explain why young women were willing to show greater defiance during the War. They were not so far removed from their childhoods, in which they rode horses, shot guns, and ran around with the boys. The idea that these girls were “raised without much sexual differentiation” is evocative of one of Dawson’s diary entries where she wrote, “Pshaw! there are no women here! We are all men!”[^delicate_flowers_vignette-10] The older women in this study, contrarily, had not only felt the pressures of Southern society, but they had adapted to the point that they underpinned the system. Because of this, they likely felt greater pressure to restrain themselves so they felt more defenseless, leading them to lament their circumstances to a greater degree.
