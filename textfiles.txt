old book i have never read it i began with high expectations and recommendations as bulwer's best must confess i was greatly disapointed i think what will he do with it is one of the best novels i ever read with that as my last remembrance of bulwer it would scarce be expected i could admire old mr caxton's eccentric disposition or ladie caxton's great lack of spirit through fear of her liege lord beulah was my companion i could not listen to her distressed whine unfastened her chain she went out as i came to my room after tea and has not yet returned i fear they will all get into trouble

beulah left the room they all killed seven sheep last night uncle elum knocked fosco in the head beulah ran to my room thereby saving her life father sent for her and then came for her but oh he knew not what he asked to give my dog my best friend my beulah who had so often defended me in danger my only protector in the dead hour of night to drive her from my side to be murdered i would as soon thought of kneeling myself on the block as to see my best friend father positively forbid my takeing her off i hope god will forgive me for the disobedience but i was obliged to do it mary robinson and joe smith took her to memphis in the buggy to ed and rhoda i know they will love her none of them sympathise or appreciate the sorrow it gave me to part with poor beulah old wright's drunken son

that simple word april sunday 10 1864 oh what a relief to the weary aching brain when there seems naught for which to live when this beautiful earth holds no joy when the glorious sunsets with their rose tinted clouds have no beauty when our lifes barks seem drifting ceaselessly on and we are powerless for good or ill oh what a relief to lie down and closing our eyes forget it all to feel that at least while we slumber the scorpion sting of memory is robbed of it's poison the goading burning lash of human thought stayed and then comes a day glareing again and so it goes on to the bitter end we are all alike in this wicked human world let us strive as we will to soar above it at last it all comes back to us human hearts full of passion love and beauty full of sin sorrow and suffering the world overflowing with good and ill sometimes in life our value is appreciated and we can claim true affectionate friends meet with lofty generous souls whose very beings thrill with instinctive love for the whole human race but mostly we are not understood until the flowers and shadowy green grass bloom and fade above us and we lie mute below such is my life how long it must be no matter god in his own good time will brighten my life a beautiful day col perkins and jimmie greer spent the day with us helen nannie came home i finished corinthians father and all of us sat in the parlor after tea laura bettie said a very good lesson i am as usual alone my two companions fast in slumber god grant peace we humbly crave give us our liberty and make us a christian land god bless my brothers

rebelion in every way in my power he sent me word i must not think of attending jennie eave's wedding or go out of doors at all he would be compelled to arrest me if it came to him officially but as my father was a royal arch mason and i a mason he would take no steps if i would be quiet mrs facklen mr mrs goodwyn mr leach and dr irwin all went to the wedding i staid at home and spent the evening with mrs summers and the dr they were very pleasant and not the least bitter in their feeling towards the south ah but they are yankees i can't forget it when with them april friday 22 1864 all ready for breakfast this morning notwithstanding the late hour of retiring last night they all spent a delightful evening the bride looked beautiful the groom charming and all passed as merry as a marriage

school house with the children at play i greeted them with school butter when all hands joined and i thought for a while mr wilson had a skirmish on hand we compromised however when old grey refused to pull up the hill and mr w had to come to our relief we ate dinner there which was broken up by the hardest rain i ever was exposed to we left the scene in disgust and demoralized had a terible time

when i awoke and saw hal's face swolen completely disfigured relieved however mr w left early with a book to read after all the trouble we have had a nice time june thursday 9 1864 a bright and beautiful day yet the roads very heavy 8 miles from oxford hills all the way left quite early were very fortunate in getting to the place we did mr wilson with his usual kindness assisted us greatly

forbear and bid you my gentle and puserlanermus cuss a fond adeu miss belle edmondson a kiss august wednesday 3 1864 third anniversary of my beloved mother's death there are few more sorrowful times

medicine as we are very much in job's fix september sunday 18 1864 all went to church his morning except lou mary lou and i we had a nice quiet time i fixed poor lou's afflicted head and am really

henderson was very kind indeed to me i arrived at pontotoc about 1 o'clock found mary alone and delighted to see me very stormy and rainy so i have not accomplished anything and made no preperations for my trip but will certainly if providence permits leave here thursday morning i sat up quite late writing to dear lucy so that i could send by the boy who drove me up and have mailed at okolona

to town and thinks perhaps i can get mr carr to take me over cousin ginnie and eddie miller came over and staid a few moments only no news on earth and not worth while to write in my journal september

eat such filth and went to bed hungry
pooshee feb 1865 my dear meta as we are cut off from each other now i will attempt to write for you in journal form an account of the trying times through which we are passing after the evacuation of savannah we were very anxious to get to aiken but pa1 thought it best not to go until we were certain of sherman's movements we heard from time to time that charleston could not be held and yet we heard on every side that augusta was his destination several events occurred which would have prevented our going up if it had been our intention the freshet then too henry's2 illness and last of all the cutting of the railroad which effectually cut us off we got newspaper accounts of sherman's movements on orangeburg and then there was a report that he was marching down the state road to charleston and of course we believed it every day report brought them nearer hennie had the silver packed ready for interment on wed'y evening the 10th of feb'y a note came from aunt ria1 saying the yankees were not far from walworth that they had burnt two houses on the river and that all the men and boys in the upper parish were leaving home and going to a place of safety this made us very uneasy on harry's account for he was very weak that night we got a note from pa who was staying at indianfield asking hennie to send for them very early the next morning he said uncle rene's 2 horses would be used for something else as there was no time to be lost and telling her to have the silver ready we thought the note very mysterious but were not at all alarmed by it for on the 16th the next day grand pa3 sent off for salt and sent one of the servants to town for some things we needed after breakfast i was quietly reading the queens of england when we heard a horse racing up the avenue cousin henrietta4 had sent word to say that the yankees were at moorfield and asked two of us for pity sake go and stay with her you can never imagine our feelings when we heard it and thought of aunt ria by herself my first impulse was to burn my letters and to put on a suit of good clothes in case the others should be taken by that time the carriage came from indianfield and pa came in he was in such a hurry that he never said good morning but told us to come and help him pack he then went in and told harry that he must go right off fright seemed to make us all strong for two of us nearly ran with harry's trunk down one flight of stairs and up another pa and harry went off in the carriage loaded with all kinds of things and uncle rene went on horse back though it was a relief to get them off it was a very sad parting for we did not know when we would meet again and the excitement in harry's weak state made him so nervous we were very uneasy about him soon after they got off we remembered the wine up stairs and though we did not know at what moment the yankees would be here we made the attempt to bring it down and then we had time to seal the bottles and have them buried in the garden by that time a wagon came from moorfield with some of aunt ria's things we were very much relieved to hear that the enemy was not at moorfield but near walworth a carriage then came from indianfield and you would have been amused to see the number of people in it four nurses and eight children the house was in confusion all day belle and aunt ria both moving over and grand pa moving provisions into the house we all worked so hard that we were completely worn out by night aunt ria came that evening and told us how the mistake had been made she had written to sarrazins exactly what she wrote us the evening before the family there sent word to the driver at brunswick that the yankees were near moorfield and he must give out the corn to the negroes the driver sent word to northampton that they were at moorfield as everything was so quiet emily 1 and i went to spend the night with cousin henrietta we had not been frightened enough for one day for after supper mr jervey's 2 entire family came down they had heard that the raiders had burnt mr parker's house near them they had intended coming down the next day but this news brought them at once emily had gone to bed with a headache and wanted to get up and come home but i persuaded her they could not get there before the next day though i was so frightened i could scarcely stand so much for one day of yankee fright febr'y 17 we were quite relieved to hear that the enemy had taken the state road and gone down to summerville they had visited several places and taken what they pleased on our way home we met belle1 and sister2 who told us of a report that the yankees were at the rocks church and the plantation on their way to belle isle i did not believe it but thought it better to be prepared so buried a few things aunt ria received a note from cousin edward3 saying there was no truth in the reports we had heard that there was not a yankee this side of orangeburg we were not left quiet for long for that evening capt guerard from savannah rode up to say that he had come to notify the planters that all of their corn was to be impressed by our government to feed the army on its retreat from charleston and that planters would be obliged to remove their property beyond the lines this was the first intimation we had that the evacuation had commenced we then held a council of war and decided that we must send and let the gentlemen know what we had heard fortunately we had found out that they were at the eady's we all felt very blue for we heard that our army was crossing as fast as possible at st stephens and then the bridge was to be burned febr'y 18th by breakfast time the hiding party arrived at first pa said it was impossible to stay here that we must leave if we had to walk but upon deliberation he concluded we could not go for the railroad being cut our only way was by orangeburg which we knew had been in the hands of the enemy and besides we did not know if we had a house to go to for we had heard nothing definite from aiken we had three of our soldiers to spend the night and they cheered us up a great deal and said it was best to stay at home feb'y 19th i have never spent such a sunday and hope i never will spend such another we were in confusion from the time we got up until we went to bed aunt bet 4 moved over and mr gignilliat came with her to spend a few hours i had just been hoping that some of the soldiers we knew would stop here that night after we had all retired tom heyward came up his feet all blistered from marching on the 20th tom heyward tom porcher ravenel and samuel ravenel all left to join their respective commands tom porcher having joined mr gignilliat's battery we were very anxious that harry should go along with them but he was by no means strong enough nothing occurred of any consequence except our soldiers coming in continually until the 24th when we heard that there was fighting down at biggin church uncle thomas 1 who was at home hurried off and belle2 moved her family to pineville to secure a summer home about dinner time a party of horsemen rode up for a time we thought them yankees but soon found out they were a squad under lieut miller from colcock's cavalry on the 25th just at dinner time dr waring drove up to say that uncle thomas would pass through in a few moments on his way to st stephens and that our pickets were retreating before the enemy in a very short time a number of our men passed through the yard we felt as if our last friends had left us and that we would never see a confederate soldier again and to add to our discomfort dr waring told us that the yankees had visited gippy taken all they wished and then given out everything else to the negroes cousin catherine's3 clothes were thrown out her bed clothes towels c burnt her person was guarded that was all of course this put us in a state of mind that night pennie 4 and myself sat up until 2 00 o'clock putting away things in a mattress we opened the cotton and put the things between though the next day was sunday we found a hiding place in our room and put away a great many things that evening we heard that mr harvey 5 had been visited but not very badly treated just as we had gone up stairs a servant of uncle rene's came in to say that the yankees were all along the road from fairspring to wantoot we all slept in our clothes that night for we were certain they would be here before morning on the 27th about midday the alarm was given that the yankees were coming but we had our fright for nothing for they turned out to be some of our scouts under lieut bright they had four prisoners taken near mr westcoat's place with a cart full of things two of our men said they wanted to kill the prisoners but the others would not let them they stayed that night and the next at harbin or a part of the next for a servant betrayed and they were taken so much by surprise that two of these men were killed two wounded and bright and two of his men taken prisoners the yankees fired several times into the house thinking men were there they then gave out everything to the negroes which they all brought back to cousin jane 1
the 1st of march is a day which we will never forget everything went on as usual until nine o'clock at night when we heard several pistol shots in the negro yard i ran up stairs to tell pennie who had gone to bed and by the time i got back we heard a noise at the back door our hearts sank when we heard them talking for they were negroes without an officer what we had always dreaded they asked for the master of the house and when grand pa went out they asked in the most insolent manner for his horses wagons meat and poultry they then asked if there were any fire arms in the house and told there was none but a plantation gun they said they would not believe that such a house could be without a gun and that they would have it or shed blood they then went off into the yard to get the things they emptied the smoke house took what poultry they wanted and then went to the store room under the house took a few things from there and told the negroes to go in and take the rest which they did cleaning out the store room and meat room there were a great many things there for aunt bet had moved over her provisions the plantation negroes took about twenty bushels of salt twenty of rice fifteen of grist besides several jars of lard molasses all of hennie's soap a box of pineland crockery and a good many other things they left us with one quart of salt in the house and would not bring any of it back until pa stated the case to a white yankee the next day and he went around and made them bring some of it back when the negro soldiers first went to the store room they sent for grand pa it made our blood curdle to hear our aged relative spoken to in the manner they did we were all in the hall and could hear everything that went on below after some very impudent language we heard a gun click i will never forget that moment as long as i live the wretch had his gun pointed at grand pa and though we found out afterwards that they did not dare to take life we did not know it at the time after this they called up the negroes and told them they were free and if they worked for grand pa again they would shoot them they then went off with three horses a wagon and a buggy they told the negroes that the army would be through the next day to take our clothes and other things three of us sat up in the hall for the rest of the night and though the others retired to their rooms there was rest for no one it must have been too mortifying to poor grand pa for his negroes to behave as they did taking the bread out of our mouths i thought better of them than that i have attempted to describe that dreadful night but nothing can come up to the reality the next morning everything looked so desolate that it made us feel sad most of the house servants came in crying and said they were willing to do for us but were afraid of course we would not put them in any danger so sent them all off we sat down to breakfast to a plate of hominy and cold corn bread that had been cooked the day before for one of our soldiers the very night before we had sat down to an elaborate supper such are the fortunes of war we cleaned up the house and cooked dinner looking all the time for our friends for such we considered the officers just as our dinner was put on the table a party rode up we were so glad to see them that we all went in the piazza the officer came forward and bowed very politely pa then told him how we had been treated the night before and asked what guarantee we would have against such treatment in the future capt hurlbut who was in command of the party said that the black soldiers had no authority to come without an officer and if found they would be punished he said that gen'l potter would be along soon and we might get a protection from him but afterwards he said that he would write a paper which might do us good and certainly would do no harm i do not remember the words but the sense of it was that we had very wisely remained at home while many had flocked to other parts of the confederacy he said that everything had already been taken from us and he would advise that we would not be further molested he then spoke to the negroes told them they were free and could either go away or stay at home but if they remained on the place they must work for no one could live without working he told them they would be better off if they stayed at home soon after col hartwell and staff arrived they all agreed in saying that the marauders would be punished and the colonel signed the paper one of his staff got quite familiar played with aunt ria's baby little maria and ended by kissing her we laugh and tell the baby she has caught a yankee beau and she always laughs and seems to enjoy the joke in a very short time gen'l potter and his staff came up in the piazza then the army commenced passing through the yard about three regiments of infantry one white and two colored passed through besides artillery and cavalry each one stopped sic and the men ran in every direction after poultry they marched the colored regiments right by the piazza i suppose as an insult to us the negroes were collected in the yard and cheered them on hennie1 and sister2 asked the general if he could not leave us a guard that night but he said there was no use his army did not straggle and that he could not leave a guard at every place he passed the general did not make a favorable impression on us 1 he was very short in his manner but his staff were very polite one of them told us to try the general again you must not be too surprised at our staying out in the piazza with so many men for there were a great many of us to keep company and then we had never seen such a sight in our lives before the last of the army had not left the yard before we saw the general returning he said he had determined to take up his headquarters here that night we were all of course delighted for we could not have been better guarded they had the parlor for their sitting room and one chamber for the general the wagon train camped just in front of the house and two regiments in the field in front there was a sentinel at the front and one at the back door all night the camp fires looked very pretty at night did we ever imagine that pooshee would be headquarters for a yankee army about two hundred head of poultry and a great many sheep were killed the negroes own did not escape we recognized one of the prisoners that our scouts had here the first of the week driving a cart and lieut bright and his men were prisoners that night in the wash room one of them asked to be allowed to speak to some of the girls who were at the back door he seemed to be a gentleman during the course of the next day soldiers were continually passing through our protection paper was of great use for we were not molested again and from that day to this 9th of march we have been in comparative quiet wantoot2 house has been burned also seven unoccupied houses in pineville some of the residents there were shamefully treated even their clothes taken from them uncle rene was among the fortunate ones he only had a ham stolen from his house but all of his poultry they went into the house at woodboo though a mrs williams was living there to protect it opened every drawer and box in the house dressed themselves in uncle thomas's and the boys new clothes leaving their old ones behind at northampton they were told by the negroes that a good many things were hid in the house so made a thorough search they actually threatened to hang mr jervey and had the rope brought for some time they had been told that treasure had been buried the people about here would not have suffered near as much if it had not been for these negroes in every case they have told where things have been hidden and they did most of the stealing the negroes here have behaved worse than any i have heard of yet daddy sandy is as faithful as ever he is sorry that the yankees have been here george still comes about the house but does not do much daddy billy who we all thought so much of has not come in since they were made free he pretends to be hurt because hennie told him he could go if he wanted to hennie's maid annette has taken herself off kate comes to attend in the bed rooms night and morning we have to do our own cooking now and you don't know how nicely we do it we take it by turns to cook dinner in the pantry two going together every day i have not touched my needle for a week would you believe that the field negroes are in a dreadful state they will not work but either roam the country or sit in their houses at first they all said they were going but have changed their minds now pa has a plan to propose to them by which they are to pay grand pa so much for the hire of the land and houses but they will not come up to hear it i do not see how we are to live in this country without any rule or regulation we are afraid now to walk outside of the gate we have just heard a report that charlie porcher has been taken prisoner in a fight near aiken and fear it is true do let me tell you a smart trick of cephas grand pa's carpenter it is worthy of the yankees before the minds of the moorfield negroes had been poisoned he went there and told the servant robert that aunt ria had sent him for a cart five turkeys and a sheep he then came here at night took up his wife adela and traveled off to charleston one of aunt ria's negroes who had always been sick got one mule from moorfield another mule and carriage from some other place went to pinopolis and took all of mr stevens's1 books the next day he went for the piano he told some of the negroes that he had been playing on it already the negroes are in the most lawless and demoralized state imaginable if this is what the yankees intended they have made their work complete we have to keep everything under lock and key and can call nothing our own now grand pa seems completely broken down tho he tries to keep up it must be too hard for one of his age to have everything so changed from what he has been accustomed to all of his life the day that the yankees left here george brought in an envelope which he found in the prison the wash house it was directed to miss carrie cribbs tuscaloosa ala on the back was a confederate stamp and inside a blank sheet of paper folded at first we did not think anything of it but the idea soon struck aunt bet that it was left here with an object which was that we should write and let the young lady know what had become of him we heard afterward that one of the prisoners name was cribbs so that settled all doubts we had on the subject we will send the letter off the first opportunity we hear of tho i can't say when that will be for we are entirely cut off from the world and almost entirely from neighborhood news march 10 we received notes from white hall and sarrazins and also a letter from alice palmer quite a treat the white hall negroes behaved shamefully they rushed into the house tore down the curtains carried off bedding blankets and trunks and are grumbling now that they have not enough we hear that one man asked cousin marianne1 to step out and take a dance that they were on equality now march 11 uncle rene dined here to day it was really refreshing to see some one out of the house he says there is a report that sherman has been defeated with heavy loss and is going down to georgetown i fear it is too good to be true uncle rene also brought the news that fighting was going on at blue hole uncle charles snowden's place i suppose it can only be a skirmish how composedly we can be talking of fighting in our very midst one item of news which i must not forget to tell you is that newport has taken the cooking and we are all ladies again march 13th dr waring 2 came in to day and told us the particulars of the affair at blue hole on thursday four yankee negroes with a good many plantation negroes armed went to moorfield there they found a quantity of wine a good many men joined them from there and cedar grove mounted on anything they could find and in a drunken state they all rode up the parish when they reached blue hole charlie snowden who was there on a visit went off and informed our scouts they killed two or three of the negroes and took several prisoners which i do not think they kept long after they left the negro soldiers made the negroes move everything out of the house and the family had to go into the kitchen the next day our scouts came up again to assist aunt harrie3 in recovering her things but she begged them to go away that they had been the cause of her trouble so they left in not at all a good humor and we have heard nothing more i hope young charlie snowden has succeeded in getting out of the way several of the people about here have put up the white flag because the yankees told them it would be a sign that they had already been visited our scouts did not like it they said it looked as if the country had submitted so they have all been taken down i am so glad we never had one up march 14th we all went to northampton this morning to pay a visit quite an era in our own monotonous lives pa rode on horse back and we closed up the ranks on foot march 15th aunt ria left us this morning to stay a while at woodlawn she went in the buggy with the baby and maum mary the two boys followed in the cart march 16th dr white dined here to day he had just crossed the river he had not seen a paper for some time so of course could not tell us much news sherman had not been defeated and was avoiding a battle march 17th drs white and waring paid visits here to day we are not as much cut off as we expected at first dr waring told us he heard that the oath of allegiance was to be offered to every man in the country this is the worst news we have heard of for some time pa and harry will try and get out of the way but grand pa will be compelled to take it march 18th mr cain and anna maria were here to day the old gentleman seems to feel his loss very much march 20th this morning pa went to woodlawn to try and make arrangements for carrying us all to aiken he has succeeded in hiring three mules and the present plan is that we are to start on wednesday in a wagon rather a novel style of making the trip we are all anxious now to go but hate so much leaving grand pa and the rest of the family particularly in grand pa's state of health march 21st we heard rumors to day of the enemy landing on the banks of the santee and coming this way in great force which made pa decide not to go on wednesday march 22nd we heard to day from nina 1 and cousin james wilson nina writes on the 16th of march from winnsboro she had met the enemy there and had not lost much a good many houses were burned in winnsboro also the episcopal church and they were kept in constant fear cousin james and family lost everything by fire in columbia they had to spend one night in the woods with nana's 1 baby only ten days old how much some people have suffered we have every cause to be thankful for we have suffered very little in comparison to others we also heard to day of several battles in which we been victorious that france had recognized the confederacy and the united states had declared war against mexico if it could only be true we cannot help feeling hopeful anyhow dr waring mentioned that a few yankees had landed but had gone back to their gun boats so the aiken cavalcade is to go off in the morning march 23rd the club house2 came down with a crash this evening or rather the frame for the yankees had nearly stripped it of boards and the negroes finished it march 24th the caravan started for aiken to day the negroes are behaving a great deal better now on most of plantations they have commenced working again and of them that went to town have come back which i think will have a very good effect on the others our scouts have done a great deal of good in making the negroes afraid to go out march 25th harbin house was burned yesterday about 2 00 o'clock by accident we hear we have heard no particulars or what has become of the family mr myers the overseer returned home to day to join the scouts he reports that sherman has been defeated in n c and four thousand prisoners taken he was perfectly surprised to see the state of things here so different from what they are on the river we feel very anxious about henry 3 for mr myers left him a week ago in chester quite sick he was in a cotton house as he could not get private lodgings we saw a charleston courier of 21st of march the yankees claim the victories of all the battles that have been fought lately and say the rebels are nearly done up that remains to be proved march 26th this day will long be remembered by the people of pineville the regulators1 had just returned from mt pleasant with a supply of arms and ammunition last night they sent to several of the gentlemen and told them they would hang them the next day but our scouts surprised them this morning and 27 were killed eleven right off and the others in the course of the day one man was taken who told where their ammunition was hidden and then he was dispatched several made their escape in the woods but the ring leaders were killed 15 were killed from capt gourdin's place our force was 56 men that of the negroes was not known though supposed to be less we hear that col ferguson2 is on his way with 1,500 men and major jenkins with six companies they will soon put things straight again march 30th mr stevens arrived to day he does not appear to think anything of the behavior of his flock but i know he must feel mortified and disappointed he will remain and preach for us as long as it is safe for him to do so to day has been a regular mail day mr stevens brought letters from nina mrs sams and auntie 3 one from uncle charlie snowden saying he had taken possession of our farm and also mentioning that some of wheeler's men had broken into the house taken all of the carpets blankets and provisions this evening hennie received a long note from cousin marianne porcher she mentioned that hardee had been repulsed but that after that johnston had defeated sherman taking 4,000 prisoners text encoded by jennifer stowe and natalia smith first edition 1998 ca 300k academic affairs library unc ch

children as he had on not only his own sword and spurs but uncle henry's dragging behind him mother had all father's clothes in a trunk in the entry but he passed that by going into mother's room noticed father's tin box of papers then to the press mother trembled as the silver we were using was all hidden in her dresses but finding no man's clothes with some most contemptuous expression about her using the poor old man so badly having so much more clothes he left only stopping at my room door not coming in one of the men rushed up before leaving and carried off the blanket from the boys bed the provost marshal tried to make father take the oath when he refused cursed him and told mother the men were all fools but he was sorry for the woman the wretches actually carried off a towel that was hanging on the railing to dry after they had gone mother missed laura such stories of yankees carrying off little ones our hearts sank we sent to the negro yard hoping she may have strayed to mauma's house but no one had seen her ah the sorrow for us so helpless nothing to do but try and comfort mother aunt nenna's room once had a window on the piazza when the shed room was added it was boarded up the high bedstead with its curtains was put against it the brick wall being thick the recess of the window made a splendid hiding place for valuables from the yankees mother was sitting weeping by the fire place when she heard a faint voice dem yankee gone yet she thought at first she was dreaming when the question was repeated soon sorrow was turned into joy she had wandered from her haven of refuge in my room to find mother failing to do so she had crept into a good place to hide and worn out with terror and weeping had fallen asleep hear the yankees are en route for

scouts dress up dr waring was telling us the night the yankees were at hog swamp they took mrs dehay out in the woods and tried to make her betray the scouts hiding place in the swamp none of their threats or bribes had any effect they even told her if she did not tell where dennis and his men were they would burn her house down she says her blood was up she told them they could do what they

raid had started from charleston a negro brigade with white officers they told us to our horror that they had taken prisoner two gentlemen on their plantations in lower st john's one our friend mr mazyck porcher and mr william ravenel a cousin of ours and burned down mr porcher's house the next thing we heard was that the plantation of old mr james gaillard had been raided and the house almost destroyed this was because when the troops arrived they found two of the scouts riding away from the house where they had been given breakfast mr gaillard was an old man and his house was a veritable haven of refuge for women and children one of the granddaughters who lived with him had an infant of two or three weeks old and there were a number of others old and young homeless bereaved and afflicted women one of the officers ordered them all to leave the house he stood on the steps using frightful language as he was in a towering rage on account of their sheltering bushwhackers as he called them these women were courageous enough to refuse to leave the house knowing very well that it would be burned down if they did they all gathered on the piazza while the soldiers ripped off the

heyward pooshee feb 1865 my dear meta as we are cut off from each other now i will attempt to write for you in journal form an account of the trying times through which we are passing after the evacuation of savannah we were very anxious to get to aiken but pa1 thought it best not to go until we were certain of sherman's movements we heard from time to time that charleston could not be held and yet we heard on every side that augusta was his destination several events occurred which would have prevented our going up if it had been our intention the freshet then too henry's2 illness and last of all the cutting of the railroad which effectually cut us off we got newspaper accounts of sherman's movements on orangeburg and then there was a report that he was marching down the state road to charleston and of course we believed it every day report brought them nearer hennie had the silver packed ready for interment on wed'y evening the 10th of feb'y a note came from aunt ria1 saying the yankees were not far from walworth that they had burnt two houses on the river and that all the men and boys in the upper parish were leaving home and going to a place of safety this made us very uneasy on harry's account for he was very weak that night we got a note from pa who was staying at indianfield asking hennie to send for them very early the next morning he said uncle rene's 2 horses would be used for something else as there was no time to be lost and telling her to have the silver ready we thought the note very mysterious ________________ 1 henry wm ravenel the botanist 2 henry w ravenel jr son of h w r 1 mrs percival r porcher 2 rene ravenel m d ________________ page 28 but were not at all alarmed by it for on the 16th the next day grand pa3 sent off for salt and sent one of the servants to town for some things we needed after breakfast i was quietly reading the queens of england when we heard a horse racing up the avenue cousin henrietta4 had sent word to say that the yankees were at moorfield and asked two of us for pity sake go and stay with her you can never imagine our feelings when we heard it and thought of aunt ria by herself my first impulse was to burn my letters and to put on a suit of good clothes in case the others should be taken by that time the carriage came from indianfield and pa came in he was in such a hurry that he never said good morning but told us to come and help him pack he then went in and told harry that he must go right off fright seemed to make us all strong for two of us nearly ran with harry's trunk down one flight of stairs and up another pa and harry went off in the carriage loaded with all kinds of things and uncle rene went on horse back though it was a relief to get them off it was a very sad parting for we did not know when we would meet again and the excitement in harry's weak state made him so nervous we were very uneasy about him soon after they got off we remembered the wine up stairs and though we did not know at what moment the yankees would be here we made the attempt to bring it down and then we had time to seal the bottles and have them buried in the garden by that time a wagon came from moorfield with some of aunt ria's things we were very much relieved to hear that the enemy was not at moorfield but near walworth a carriage then came from indianfield and you would have been amused to see the number of people in it four nurses and eight children the house was in confusion all day belle and aunt ria both moving over and grand pa moving provisions into the house we all worked so hard that we were completely worn out by night aunt ria came that evening and told us how the mistake had been made she had written to sarrazins exactly what she wrote us the evening before ________________ 3 henry ravenel of pooshee 4 mrs henry l stevens ________________ page 29 the family there sent word to the driver at brunswick that the yankees were near moorfield and he must give out the corn to the negroes the driver sent word to northampton that they were at moorfield as everything was so quiet emily 1 and i went to spend the night with cousin henrietta we had not been frightened enough for one day for after supper mr jervey's 2 entire family came down they had heard that the raiders had burnt mr parker's house near them they had intended coming down the next day but this news brought them at once emily had gone to bed with a headache and wanted to get up and come home but i persuaded her they could not get there before the next day though i was so frightened i could scarcely stand so much for one day of yankee fright febr'y 17 we were quite relieved to hear that the enemy had taken the state road and gone down to summerville they had visited several places and taken what they pleased on our way home we met belle1 and sister2 who told us of a report that the yankees were at the rocks church and the plantation on their way to belle isle i did not believe it but thought it better to be prepared so buried a few things aunt ria received a note from cousin edward3 saying there was no truth in the reports we had heard that there was not a yankee this side of orangeburg we were not left quiet for long for that evening capt guerard from savannah rode up to say that he had come to notify the planters that all of their corn was to be impressed by our government to feed the army on its retreat from charleston and that planters would be obliged to remove their property beyond the lines this was the first intimation we had that the evacuation had commenced we then held a council of war and decided that we must send and let the gentlemen know what we had heard fortunately we had found out that they were at the eady's we all felt very blue for we heard that

st stephens and then the bridge was to be burned febr'y 18th by breakfast time the hiding party arrived at first pa said it was impossible to stay here that we must leave if we had to walk but upon deliberation he concluded we could not go for the railroad being cut our only way was by orangeburg which we knew had been in the hands of the enemy and besides we did not know if we had a house to go to for we had heard nothing definite from aiken we had three of our soldiers to spend the night and they cheered us up a great deal and said it was best to stay at home feb'y 19th i have never spent such a sunday and hope i never will spend such another we were in confusion from the time we got up until we went to bed aunt bet 4 moved over and mr gignilliat came with her to spend a few hours i had just been hoping that some of the soldiers we knew would stop here that night after we had all retired tom heyward came up his feet all blistered from marching on the 20th tom heyward tom porcher ravenel and samuel ravenel all left to join their respective commands tom porcher having joined mr gignilliat's battery we were very anxious that harry should go along with them but he was by no means strong enough nothing occurred of any consequence except our soldiers coming in continually until the 24th when we heard that there was fighting down at biggin church uncle thomas 1 who was at home hurried off and belle2 moved her family to pineville to secure a summer home about dinner time a party of horsemen rode up for a time we thought them yankees but soon found out they were a squad under lieut miller from colcock's cavalry on the 25th just at dinner time dr waring drove up to say that uncle thomas would pass through in a few moments on his way to st stephens and that our pickets were retreating before the enemy in a very short time a number of our men passed through the yard we ________________ 4 mrs thomas p ravenel 1 thomas p ravenel 2 mrs rene ravenel dr morton waring of chelsea ________________ page 31 felt as if our last friends had left us and that we would never see a confederate soldier again and to add to our discomfort dr waring told us that the yankees had visited gippy taken all they wished and then given out everything else to the negroes cousin catherine's3 clothes were thrown out her bed clothes towels c burnt her person was guarded that was all of course this put us in a state of mind that night pennie 4 and myself sat up until 2 00 o'clock putting away things in a mattress we opened the cotton and put the things between though the next day was sunday we found a hiding place in our room and put away a great many things that evening we heard that mr harvey 5 had been visited but not very badly treated just as we had gone up stairs a servant of uncle rene's came in to say that the yankees were all along the road from fairspring to wantoot we all slept in our clothes that night for we were certain they would be here before morning on the 27th about midday the alarm was given that the yankees were coming but we had our fright for nothing for they turned out to be some of our scouts under lieut bright they had four prisoners taken near mr westcoat's place with a cart full of things two of our men said they wanted to kill the prisoners but the others would not let them they stayed that night and the next at harbin or a part of the next for a servant betrayed and they were taken so much by surprise that two of these men were killed two wounded and bright and two of his men taken prisoners the yankees fired several times into the house thinking men were there they then gave out everything to the negroes which they all brought back to cousin jane 1 the 1st of march is a day which we will never forget everything went on as usual until nine o'clock at night when we heard several pistol shots in the negro yard i ran up stairs to tell pennie who had gone to bed and by the time i got back we heard a noise at the back door our hearts sank when we heard them talking for they were negroes without an officer ________________ 3 mrs john s white 4 miss h e ravenel 5 arnold harvey 1 mrs jane e dubose ________________ page 32 what we had always dreaded they asked for the master of the house and when grand pa went out they asked in the most insolent manner for his horses wagons meat and poultry they then asked if there were any fire arms in the house and told there was none but a plantation gun they said they would not believe that such a house could be without a gun and that they would have it or shed blood they then went off into the yard to get the things they emptied the smoke house took what poultry they wanted and then went to the store room under the house took a few things from there and told the negroes to go in and take the rest which they did cleaning out the store room and meat room there were a great many things there for aunt bet had moved over her provisions the plantation negroes took about twenty bushels of salt twenty of rice fifteen of grist besides several jars of lard molasses all of hennie's soap a box of pineland crockery and a good many other things they left us with one quart of salt in the house and would not bring any of it back until pa stated the case to a white yankee the next day and he went around and made them bring some of it back when the negro soldiers first went to the store room they sent for grand pa it made our blood curdle to hear our aged relative spoken to in the manner they did we were all in the hall and could hear everything that went on below after some very impudent language we heard a gun click i will never forget that moment as long as i live the wretch had his gun pointed at grand pa and though we found out afterwards that they did not dare to take life we did not know it at the time after this they called up the negroes and told them they were free and if they worked for grand pa again they would shoot them they then went off with three horses a wagon and a buggy they told the negroes that the army would be through the next day to take our clothes and other things three of us sat up in the hall for the rest of the night and though the others retired to their rooms there was rest for no one it must have been too mortifying to poor grand pa for his negroes to behave as they did taking the bread out of our mouths i thought better of them than that i have attempted to describe that dreadful night but nothing can come up to the ________________ page 33 reality the next morning everything looked so desolate that it made us feel sad most of the house servants came in crying and said they were willing to do for us but were afraid of course we would not put them in any danger so sent them all off we sat down to breakfast to a plate of hominy and cold corn bread that had been cooked the day before for one of our soldiers the very night before we had sat down to an elaborate supper such are the fortunes of war we cleaned up the house and cooked dinner looking all the time for our friends for such we considered the officers just as our dinner was put on the table a party rode up we were so glad to see them that we all went in the piazza the officer came forward and bowed very politely pa then told him how we had been treated the night before and asked what guarantee we would have against such treatment in the future capt hurlbut who was in command of the party said that the black soldiers had no authority to come without an officer and if found they would be punished he said that gen'l potter would be along soon and we might get a protection from him but afterwards he said that he would write a paper which might do us good and certainly would do no harm i do not remember the words but the sense of it was that we had very wisely remained at home while many had flocked to other parts of the confederacy he said that everything had already been taken from us and he would advise that we would not be further molested he then spoke to the negroes told them they were free and could either go away or stay at home but if they remained on the place they must work for no one could live without working he told them they would be better off if they stayed at home soon after col hartwell and staff arrived they all agreed in saying that the marauders would be punished and the colonel signed the paper one of his staff got quite familiar played with aunt ria's baby little maria and ended by kissing her we laugh and tell the baby she has caught a yankee beau and she always laughs and seems to enjoy the joke in a very short time gen'l potter and his staff came up in the piazza then the army commenced passing through the yard ________________ page 34 about three regiments of infantry one white and two colored passed through besides artillery and cavalry each one stopped sic and the men ran in every direction after poultry they marched the colored regiments right by the piazza i suppose as an insult to us the negroes were collected in the yard and cheered them on hennie1 and sister2 asked the general if he could not leave us a guard that night but he said there was no use his army did not straggle and that he could not leave a guard at every place he passed the general did not make a favorable impression on us 1 he was very short in his manner but his staff were very polite one of them told us to try the general again you must not be too surprised at our staying out in the piazza with so many men for there were a great many of us to keep company and then we had never seen such a sight in our lives before the last of the army had not left the yard before we saw the general returning he said he had determined to take up his headquarters here that night we were all of course delighted for we could not have been better guarded they had the parlor for their sitting room and one chamber for the general the wagon train camped just in front of the house and two regiments in the field in front there was a sentinel at the front and one at the back door all ________________ 1 miss henrietta ravenel 2 miss lydia ravenel 3 it would appear that general potter made an even less favorable impression at otranto in st james goose creek the home of philip johnstone percher as it was then near midnight we decided to go to bed and mother said she would go down in the morning and request that a written protection be furnished us as this had been suggested by the quiet looking officer our protector of the afternoon before therefore as early as possible she did so but general potter received her very shortly and only replied your husband is in the rebel army she replied it was our desire that he should leave us and i am glad he is not here for if he had been i suppose he would have been shot he replied you talk like a fool when you say that and turned off when mother said if that is your opinion i have the more need of protection from some war time letters by marion

the first of the week driving a cart and lieut bright and his men were prisoners that night in the wash room one of them asked to be allowed to speak to some of the girls who were at the back door he seemed to be a gentleman during the course of the next day soldiers were continually passing through our protection paper was of great use for we were not molested again and from that day to this 9th of march we have been in comparative quiet wantoot2 house has been burned also seven unoccupied houses in pineville some of the residents there were shamefully treated even their clothes taken from them uncle rene was among the fortunate ones he only had a ham stolen from his house but all of his poultry they went into the house at woodboo though a mrs williams was living there to protect it opened every drawer and box in the house dressed themselves in uncle thomas's and the boys new clothes leaving their old ones behind at northampton they were told by the negroes that a good many things were hid in the house so made a thorough search they actually threatened to hang mr jervey and had the rope brought for some time they had been told that treasure had been buried the people about here would not have suffered near as much if it had not been for these negroes in every case they have told where things have been hidden and they did most of the stealing the negroes here have behaved worse than any i have heard of yet daddy sandy is as faithful as ever he is sorry that the yankees have been here george still comes about the house but does not do much daddy billy who we all

and you don't know how nicely we do it we take it by turns to cook dinner in the pantry two going together every day i have not touched my needle for a week would you believe that the field negroes are in a dreadful state they will not work but either roam the country or sit in their houses at first they all said they were going but have changed their minds now pa has a plan to propose to them by which they are to pay grand pa so much for the hire of the land and houses but they will not come up to hear it i do not see how we are to live in this country without any rule or regulation we are afraid now to walk outside of the gate we have just heard a report that charlie porcher has been taken prisoner in a fight near aiken and fear it is true do let me tell you a smart trick of cephas grand pa's carpenter it is worthy of the yankees before the minds of the moorfield negroes had been poisoned he went there and told the servant robert that aunt ria had sent him for a cart five turkeys and a sheep he then came here at night took up his wife adela and traveled off to charleston one of aunt ria's negroes who had always been sick got one mule from moorfield another mule and carriage from some other place went to pinopolis and took all of mr stevens's1 books the next day he went for the piano he told some of the negroes that he had been playing on it already the negroes are in the most lawless and demoralized state imaginable if this is what the yankees intended they have made their work complete we have to keep everything under lock and key and can call nothing our own now grand pa seems completely broken down tho he tries to keep up it must be too hard for one of his age to have everything so changed from what he has been accustomed to all of his life the day that the yankees left here george brought in an envelope which he found in the prison the wash house it was directed to miss carrie cribbs tuscaloosa ala on ________________ 1 rev afterwards bishop p f stevens ________________ page 37 the back was a confederate stamp and inside a blank sheet of paper folded at first we did not think anything of it but the idea soon struck aunt bet that it was left here with an object which was that we should write and let the young lady know what had become of him we heard afterward that one of the prisoners name was cribbs so that settled all doubts we had on the subject we will send the letter off the first opportunity we hear of tho i can't say when that will be for we are entirely cut off from the world and almost entirely from neighborhood news march 10 we received notes from white hall and sarrazins and also a letter from alice palmer quite a treat the white hall negroes behaved shamefully they rushed into the house tore down the curtains carried off bedding blankets and trunks and are grumbling now that they have not enough we hear that one man asked cousin marianne1 to step out and take a dance that they were on equality now march 11 uncle rene dined here to day it was really refreshing to see some one out of the house he says there is a report that sherman has been defeated with heavy loss and is going down to georgetown i fear it is too good to be true uncle rene also brought the news that fighting was going on at blue hole uncle charles snowden's place i suppose it can only be a skirmish how composedly we can be talking of fighting in our very midst one item of news which i must not forget to tell you is that newport has taken the cooking and we are all ladies again march 13th dr waring 2 came in to day and told us the particulars of the affair at blue hole on thursday four yankee negroes with a good many plantation negroes armed went to moorfield there they found a quantity of wine a good many men joined them from there and cedar grove mounted on anything they could find and in a drunken state they all rode up the parish when they reached blue hole charlie snowden who was there on a visit went off and informed our scouts they killed two or three of the negroes ________________ 1 miss marianne e porcher 2 dr morton waring chelsea ________________ page 38 and took several prisoners which i do not think they kept long after they left the negro soldiers made the negroes move everything out of the house and the family had to go into the kitchen the next day our scouts came up again to assist aunt harrie3 in recovering her things but she begged them to go away that they had been the cause of her trouble so they left in not at all a good humor and we have heard nothing more i hope young charlie snowden has succeeded in getting out of the way several of the people about here have put up the white flag because the yankees told them it would be a sign that they had already been visited our scouts did not like it they said it looked as if the country had submitted so they have all been taken down i am so glad we never had one up march 14th we all went to northampton this morning to pay a visit quite an era in our own monotonous lives pa rode on horse back and we closed up the ranks on foot march 15th aunt ria left us this morning to stay a while at woodlawn she went in the buggy with the baby and

had taken possession of our farm and also mentioning that some of wheeler's men had broken into the house taken all of the carpets blankets and provisions this evening hennie received a long note from

porcher in the head both were doing well ravenel macbeth was wounded and a prisoner we have heard nothing of our other friends cousin marianne says she heard from negroes that the entire barker family

and there he was made to take it mr holmes refused to take it and is now a prisoner i do not know how true all this is but we must take it for what it is worth i am very thankful that pa has gotten away and that we do not live on cooper river march 31st the northampton people paid a visit here to day willie jervey is at home for a short time we heard a report to day that charleston was blockaded by fifty french vessels and that the yankees were preparing to evacuate the place it came from a man about here who had gone down to the gunboat to take the oath of allegiance
april 1st the negroes freedom was brought to a close to day during the morning a party of our scouts rode up and asked if grand pa wished them to do anything for him grand pa told them that one of his negroes had been seen with a gun but had said that it belonged to one of uncle rene's men who had gone to town so the scouts went off we were very uneasy when we saw them coming fearing that they might be yankees about dinner time another party came up edward dennis mr mctureous and several others they requested the negroes be called up and told them they were not free but slaves and would be until they died that the yankees had no right to free them and that they were to go to work as they had always done with a driver that they would be here every two or three days to see that they worked and the first one caught out without a ticket would be killed then they demanded guns from two of them and said they were to be forthcoming poor deluded creatures their friends the yankees have done them more harm than good this day month their freedom was proclaimed one report to day is that the union soldiers in savannah united with the citizens and massacred 4,000 blacks on account of their outrageous behavior another is that the gun boats have left the santee and the one on cooper river has gone lower down about dark after we had shut up the house we heard a loud rap at the front door and much to our surprise it proved to be your father mr heyward he had come all the way from aiken on horseback to carry aunt bet back april 2nd we have been permitted the privilege of again meeting at church to offer our thanks to god for his manifold mercies to us during this terrible time nearly every one in the parish succeeded in getting there mules supplying the places of all horses that had been taken it was very pleasant to meet our friends whom we had not seen for six weeks april 4th aunt bet started to day for aiken with a carriage two wagons one cart one donkey cart two cows and an outrider quite a cavalcade we heard today that two of the ring leaders from pineville went to the gunboat and told how they had been treated whereon the officers had them put in irons and sent to charleston and told them if they had only known it they would have sent a company to help the white men we received numerous letters from aiken this morning by the return wagons i am sorry to say that wheeler's men have done us more damage than the yankees i did not mind it at first when i thought they had only taken things needed but i do blame them very much for their wanton destruction of property that they ought to protect it is a shame and they ought to be exposed april 6th the scouts were here again to day under lieut pettus 1 charlie snowden has joined them hennie got them to go to wampee and send her maid anette home april 8th we have had another visit to day from the yankees before breakfast we saw smoke in the direction of somerset and the negroes told us they had heard a drum and fife in the night we thought it was imagination until a servant from wantoot told us that the yankees had burnt somerset house and were coming on soon after we saw them coming through the field and in a very short time the house was full of black yankees i remained in the hall to see what they would take there and to keep a watch on our room door the first one that came into the room asked for fire arms i told him they had all been taken the next one asked for silver i had no idea of showing him so told him i was not the lady of the house he made no reply but went on looking a number then came in and the silver was soon found and carried off 40 small pieces of table silver and soup ladle these and one candle stick were the only things taken from the hall grand pa lost all of his clothes that he had out a box was broken open some sheets and table cloths taken the rest flung over the floor interspersed with broken eggs the safe door was broken open and the ham taken several other rooms were entered and things taken but i am thankful to say our room was left untouched all of the horses were taken gen'l hartwell took good care not to come up until the darkies had left he told his captain to go and see if he could get the silver and one horse back which of course we knew he did not mean him to do the object of their visit was to catch the scouts they said we had brought all of this on ourselves for encouraging the scouts uncle rene and uncle william have both been taken prisoners and we hear are to be carried to charleston they took the latter to get information from him so they say but we think they took him because he had entertained the scouts uncle rene had to put himself under the protection of the general as there was a conspiracy detected among the black troops to come back that night and kill him the yankees went to mexico this evening and i suppose will visit all the places up there april 10th of course there was no service yesterday dr waring paid a visit and told us that mr stevens was still in the parish but keeping close this morning several of the negro men came to grand pa and asked to be allowed to stay here and work they would do anything he told them the yankees told them to go with them but they said they did not want to go two of the boys from here have joined the u s army april 11th cousin mazyck porcher 1 has been taken prisoner mexico house and all the out buildings have been burned last accounts of the enemy they were at eutaw springs april 12th uncle rene and uncle wm returned home to day we were too thankful to hear of their release they were carried as far as eutaw and then told to go home woodlawn april 14th uncle rene drove sister home and i came back here to take her place uncle rene and uncle william had a most dreadful experience on the ride from pineville to mexico with the army at one time they were guarded by only one black soldier and they could hear others all around trying to bribe their guard to give them up to be killed but the guard though a darky was above bribing pooshee april 20th i returned here to day quite unexpectedly pa came down last night and went over for me we are to leave on monday we hear the most exaggerated accounts of things here to day's reports are that lee's army 32,000 has surrendered to grant and all the men paroled not to fight again during the war the other report is that sumterville and summerton have both been burnt to the ground of course we do not believe either of them april 21st we hear to day that there has been a fight on the river and two regiments of blacks under potter completely cut up april 22nd today's news is very cheering it is that lincoln and seward have both been assassinated and that there is to be an armistice
january 1 1864 a new year is ushered in but peace comes not with it scarcely a family but has given some of its members to the bloody war that is still decimating our nation oh that its ravages may soon be stopped will another year find us among carnage and bloodshed shall we be a nation or shall we be annihilated the prices of everything are very high corn seven dollars a bushel calico ten dollars a yard salt sixty dollars a hundred cotton from sixty to eighty cents a pound everything in like ratio
january 30 1865 as the moon has changed julia the cook has gone to making soap again she is a strong believer in the moon and never undertakes to boil her soap on the wane of the moon it won't thicken mist'ess see if it does she says too we must commence gardening this moon i have felt a strong desire today that my captured boys might come back oh how thankful i should feel to see them once more safe at home
november 8 1864 to day will probably decide the fate of the confederacy if lincoln is reelected i think our fate is a hard one but we are in the hands of a merciful god and if he sees that we are in the wrong i trust that he will show it unto us i have never felt that slavery was altogether right for it is abused by men and i have often heard mr burge say that if he could see that it was sinful for him to own slaves if he felt that it was wrong he would take them where he could free them he would not sin for his right hand the purest and holiest men have owned them and i can see nothing in the scriptures which forbids it i have never bought or sold slaves and i have tried to make life easy and pleasant to those that have been bequeathed me by the dead i have never ceased to work many a northern housekeeper has a much easier time than a southern matron with her hundred negroes november 12 1864 warped and put in dresses for the loom oh this blockade gives us work to do for all hands november 15 1864 went up to covington to day to pay the confederate tax did not find the commissioners mid a slave drove me with beck and the buggy got home about three o'clock how very different is covington from what it used to be and how little did they who tore down the old flag and raised the new realize the results that have ensued november 16 1864 as i could not obtain in covington what i went for in the way of dye stuffs etc i concluded this morning in accordance with mrs ward's wish to go to the circle we took old dutch and had a pleasant ride as it was a delightful day but how dreary looks the town where formerly all was bustle and business now naked chimneys and bare walls for the depot and surroundings were all burned by last summer's raiders engaged to sell some bacon and potatoes obtained my dye stuffs paid seven dollars confederate money a pound for coffee six dollars an ounce for indigo twenty dollars for a quire of paper five dollars for ten cents worth of flax thread six dollars for pins and forty dollars for a bunch of factory thread on our way home we met brother evans accompanied by john hinton who inquired if we had heard that the yankees were coming he said that a large force was at stockbridge that the home guard was called out and that it was reported that the yankees were on their way to savannah we rode home chatting about it and finally settled it in our minds that it could not be so probably a foraging party just before night i walked up to joe perry's to know if they had heard anything of the report he was just starting off to join the company the home guard being one of them november 17 1864 have been uneasy all day at night some of the neighbors who had been to town called they said it was a large force moving very slowly what shall i do where go november 18 1864 slept very little last night went out doors several times and could see large fires like burning buildings am i not in the hands of a merciful god who has promised to take care of the widow and orphan sent off two of my mules in the night mr ward and frank a slave took them away and hid them in the morning took a barrel of salt which had cost me two hundred dollars into one of the black women's gardens put a paper over it and then on the top of that leached ashes fixed it on a board as a leach tub daubing it with ashes the old fashioned way of making lye for soap had some few pieces of meat taken from my smoke house carried to the old place a distant part of the plantation and hidden under some fodder bid them hide the wagon and gear and then go on plowing went to packing up mine and sadai's clothes i fear that we shall be homeless the boys came back and wished to hide their mules they say that the yankees camped at mr gibson's last night and are taking all the stock in the county seeing them so eager i told them to do as they pleased they took them off and elbert the black coachman took his forty fattening hogs to the old place swamp and turned them in we have done nothing all day that is my people have not i made a pair of pants for jack a slave sent nute a slave up to mrs perry's on an errand on his way back he said two yankees met him and begged him to go with them they asked if we had livestock and came up the road as far as mrs laura perry's i sat for an hour expecting them but they must have gone back oh how i trust i am safe mr ward is very much alarmed november 19 1864 slept in my clothes last night as i heard that the yankees went to neighbor montgomery's on thursday night at one o'clock searched his house drank his wine and took his money and valuables as we were not disturbed i walked after breakfast with sadai up to mr joe perry's my nearest neighbor where the yankees were yesterday saw mrs laura perry in the road surrounded by her children seeming to be looking for some one she said she was looking for her husband that old mrs perry had just sent her word that the yankees went to james perry's the night before plundered his house and drove off all his stock and that she must drive hers into the old fields before we we were done talking up came joe and jim perry from their hiding place jim was very much excited happening to turn and look behind as we stood there i saw some blue coats coming down the hill jim immediately raised his gun swearing he would kill them anyhow no don't said i and ran home as fast as i could with sadai i could hear them cry halt halt and their guns went off in quick succession oh god the time of trial has come a man passed on his way to covington i halloed to him asking him if he did not know the yankees were coming no are they yes said i they are not three hundred yards from here sure enough said he well i'll not go i don't want them to get my horse and although within hearing of their guns he would stop and look for them blissful ignorance not knowing not hearing he has not suffered the suspense the fear that i have for the past forty eight hours i walked to the gate there they came filing up i hastened back to my frightened servants and told them that they had better hide and then went back to the gate to claim protection and a guard but like demons they rush in my yards are full to my smoke house my dairy pantry kitchen and cellar like famished wolves they come breaking locks and whatever is in their way the thousand pounds of meat in my smoke house is gone in a twinkling my flour my meat my lard butter eggs pickles of various kinds both in vinegar and brine wine jars and jugs are all gone my eighteen fat turkeys my hens chickens and fowls my young pigs are shot down in my yard and hunted as if they were rebels themselves utterly powerless i ran out and appealed to the guard i cannot help you madam it is orders as i stood there from my lot i saw driven first old dutch my dear old buggy horse who has carried my beloved husband so many miles and who would so quietly wait at the block for him to mount and dismount and who at last drew him to his grave then came old mary my brood mare who for years had been too old and stiff for work with her three year old colt my two year old mule and her last little baby colt there they go there go my mules my sheep and worse than all my boys slaves alas little did i think while trying to save my house from plunder and fire that they were forcing my boys from home at the point of the bayonet one newton jumped into bed in his cabin and declared himself sick another crawled under the floor a lame boy he was but they pulled him out placed him on a horse and drove him off mid poor mid the last i saw of him a man had him going around the garden looking as i thought for my sheep as he was my shepherd jack came crying to me the big tears coursing down his cheeks saying they were making him go i said stay in my room but a man followed in cursing him and threatening to shoot him if he did not go so poor jack had to yield james arnold in trying to escape from a back window was captured and marched off henry too was taken i know not how or when but probably when he and bob went after the mules i had not believed they would force from their homes the poor doomed negroes but such has been the fact here cursing them and saying that jeff davis wanted to put them in his army but that they should not fight for him but for the union no indeed no they are not friends to the slave we have never made the poor cowardly negro fight and it is strange passing strange that the all powerful yankee nation with the whole world to back them their ports open their armies filled with soldiers from all nations should at last take the poor negro to help them out against this little confederacy which was to have been brought back into the union in sixty days time my poor boys my poor boys what unknown trials are before you how you have clung to your mistress and assisted her in every way you knew never have i corrected them a word was sufficient never have they known want of any kind their parents are with me and how sadly they lament the loss of their boys their cabins are rifled of every valuable the soldiers swearing that their sunday clothes were the white people's and that they never had money to get such things as they had poor frank's chest was broken open his money and tobacco taken he has always been a money making and saving boy not infrequently has his crop brought him five hundred dollars and more all of his clothes and rachel's clothes which dear lou gave before her death and which she had packed away were stolen from her ovens skillets coffee mills of which we had three coffee pots not one have i left sifters all gone seeing that the soldiers could not be restrained the guard offered me to have their of the negroes remaining possessions brought into my house which i did and they all poor things huddled together in my room fearing every movement that the house would be burned a captain webber from illinois came into my house of him i claimed protection from the vandals who were forcing themselves into my room he said that he knew my brother orrington the late orrington lunt a well known early settler of chicago at that name i could not restrain my feelings but bursting into tears implored him to see my brother and let him know my destitution i saw nothing before me but starvation he promised to do this and comforted me with the assurance that my dwelling house would not be burned though my out buildings might poor little sadai went crying to him as to a friend and told him that they had taken her doll nancy he begged her to come and see him and he would give her a fine waxen one the doll was found later in the yard of a neighbor where a soldier had thrown it and was returned to the little girl her children later played with it and it is now the plaything of her granddaughter he felt for me and i give him and several others the character of gentlemen i don't believe they would have molested women and children had they had their own way he seemed surprised that i had not laid away in my house flour and other provisions i did not suppose i could secure them there more than where i usually kept them for in last summer's raid houses were thoroughly searched in parting with him i parted as with a friend sherman himself and a greater portion of his army passed my house that day all day as the sad moments rolled on were they passing not only in front of my house but from behind they tore down my garden palings made a road through my back yard and lot field driving their stock and riding through tearing down my fences and desolating my home wantonly doing it when there was no necessity for it such a day if i live to the age of methuselah may god spare me from ever seeing again as night drew its sable curtains around us the heavens from every point were lit up with flames from burning buildings dinnerless and supperless as we were it was nothing in comparison with the fear of being driven out homeless to the dreary woods nothing to eat i could give my guard no supper so he left us i appealed to another asking him if he had wife mother or sister and how he should feel were they in my situation a colonel from ermont left me two men but they were dutch and i could not understand one word they said my heavenly father alone saved me from the destructive fire my carriage house had in it eight bales of cotton with my carriage buggy and harness on top of the cotton were some carded cotton rolls a hundred pounds or more these were thrown out of the blanket in which they were and a large twist of the rolls taken and set on fire and thrown into the boat of my carriage which was close up to the cotton bales thanks to my god the cotton only burned over and then went out shall i ever forget the deliverance to night when the greater part of the army had passed it came up very windy and cold my room was full nearly with the negroes and their bedding they were afraid to go out for my women could not step out of the door without an insult from the yankee soldiers they lay down on the floor sadai got down and under the same cover with sally while i sat up all night watching every moment for the flames to burst out from some of my buildings the two guards came into my room and laid themselves by my fire for the night i could not close my eyes but kept walking to and fro watching the fires in the distance and dreading the approaching day which i feared as they had not all passed would be but a continuation of horrors november 20 1864 this is the blessed sabbath the day upon which he who came to bring peace and good will upon earth rose from his tomb and ascended to intercede for us poor fallen creatures but how unlike this day to any that have preceded it in my once quiet home i had watched all night and the dawn found me watching for the moving of the soldiery that was encamped about us oh how i dreaded those that were to pass as i supposed they would straggle and complete the ruin that the others had commenced for i had been repeatedly told that they would burn everything as they passed some of my women had gathered up a chicken that the soldiers shot yesterday and they cooked it with some yams for our breakfast the guard complaining that we gave them no supper they gave us some coffee which i had to make in a tea kettle as every coffeepot is taken off the rear guard was commanded by colonel carlow who changed our guard leaving us one soldier while they were passing they marched directly on scarcely breaking ranks once a bucket of water was called for but they drank without coming in about ten o'clock they had all passed save one who came in and wanted coffee made which was done and he too went on a few minutes elapsed and two couriers riding rapidly passed back then presently more soldiers came by and this ended the passing of sherman's army by my place leaving me poorer by thirty thousand dollars than i was yesterday morning and a much stronger rebel after the excitement was a little over i went up to mrs laura's to sympathize with her for i had no doubt but that her husband was hanged she thought so and we could see no way for his escape we all took a good cry together while there i saw smoke looming up in the direction of my home and thought surely the fiends had done their work ere they left i ran as fast as i could but soon saw that the fire was below my home it proved to be the gin house cotton gin belonging to colonel pitts my boys have not come home i fear they cannot get away from the soldiers two of my cows came up this morning but were driven off again by the yankees i feel so thankful that i have not been burned out that i have tried to spend the remainder of the day as the sabbath ought to be spent ate dinner out of the oven in julia's the cook's house some stew no bread she is boiling some corn my poor servants feel so badly at losing what they have worked for meat the hog meat that they love better than anything else is all gone november 21 1864 we had the table laid this morning but no bread or butter or milk what a prospect for delicacies my house is a perfect fright i had brought in saturday night some thirty bushels of potatoes and ten or fifteen bushels of wheat poured down on the carpet in the ell then the few gallons of syrup saved was daubed all about the backbone of a hog that i had killed on friday and which the yankees did not take when they cleaned out my smokehouse i found and hid under my bed and this is all the meat i have major lee came down this evening having heard that i was burned out to proffer me a home mr dorsett was with him the army lost some of their beeves in passing i sent to day and had some driven into my lot and then sent to judge glass to come over and get some had two killed some of wheeler's men came in and i asked them to shoot the cattle which they did about ten o'clock this morning mr joe perry mrs laura's husband called i was so glad to see him that i could scarcely forbear embracing him i could not keep from crying for i was sure the yankees had executed him and i felt so much for his poor wife the soldiers told me repeatedly saturday that they had hung him and his brother james and george guise they had a narrow escape however and only got away by knowing the country so much better than the soldiers did they lay out until this morning how rejoiced i am for his family all of his negroes are gone save one man that had a wife here at my plantation they are very strong secesh secessionists when the army first came along they offered a guard for the house but mrs laura told them she was guarded by a higher power and did not thank them to do it she says that she could think of nothing else all day when the army was passing but of the devil and his hosts she had however to call for a guard before night or the soldiers would have taken everything she had november 22 1864 after breakfast this morning i went over to my grave yard to see what had befallen that to my joy i found it had not been disturbed as i stood by my dead i felt rejoiced that they were at rest never have i felt so perfectly reconciled to the death of my husband as i do to day while looking upon the ruin of his lifelong labor how it would have grieved him to see such destruction yes theirs is the lot to be envied at rest rest from care rest from heartaches from trouble found one of my large hogs killed just outside the grave yard walked down to the swamp looking for the wagon and gear that henry hid before he was taken off found some of my sheep came home very much wearied having walked over four miles mr and mrs rockmore called major lee came down again after some cattle and while he was here the alarm was given that more yankees were coming i was terribly alarmed and packed my trunks with clothing feeling assured that we should be burned out now major lee swore that he would shoot which frightened me for he was intoxicated enough to make him ambitious he rode off in the direction whence it was said they were coming soon after however he returned saying it was a false alarm that it was some of our own men oh dear are we to be always living in fear and dread oh the horrors the horrors of war november 26 1864 a very cold morning elbert the negro coachman has to go to mill this morning and i shall go with him fearing that if he is alone my mule may be taken from him for there are still many straggling soldiers about mounted in the little wagon i went carrying wheat not only for myself but for my neighbors never did i think i would have to go to mill such are the changes that come to us history tells us of some illustrious examples of this kind got home just at night mr kennedy stopped all night with us he has been refugeeing on his way home every one we meet gives us painful accounts of the desolation caused by the enemy each one has to tell his or her own experience and fellow suffering makes us all equal and makes us all feel interested in one another
december 22 1864 tuesday the nineteenth of the month i attended floyd glass's wedding she was married in the morning to lieutenant doroughty she expected to have been married the week after the yankees came but her groom was not able to get here some of the yankees found out in some way that she was to have been married and annoyed her considerably by telling her that they had taken her sweetheart prisoner that when he got off the train at the circle they took him and some said shot him the yankees found mrs glass's china and glassware that she had buried in a box broke it all up and then sent her word that she would set no more fine tables they also got mrs perry's silver december 23 1864 just before night mrs robert rakestraw and miss mary drove up to spend the night with me they had started down into jasper county hoping to get back their buggy having heard that several buggies were left at mr whitfield's by the yankees nothing new it is confidently believed that savannah has been evacuated i hear nothing from my boys poor fellows how i miss them december 24 1864 this has usually been a very busy day with me preparing for christmas not only for my own tables but for gifts for my servants now how changed no confectionery cakes or pies can i have we are all sad no loud jovial laugh from our boys is heard christmas eve which has ever been gaily celebrated here which has witnessed the popping of fire crackers the southern custom of celebrating christmas with fireworks and the hanging up of stockings is an occasion now of sadness and gloom i have nothing even to put in sadai's stocking which hangs so invitingly for santa claus how disappointed she will be in the morning though i have explained to her why he cannot come poor children why must the innocent suffer with the guilty december 25 1864 sadai jumped out of bed very early this morning to feel in her stocking she could not believe but that there would be something in it finding nothing she crept back into bed pulled the cover over her face and i soon heard her sobbing the little negroes all came in christmas gift mist'ess christmas gift mist'ess i pulled the cover over my face and was soon mingling my tears with sadai's
april 29 1865 boys plowing in old house field we are needing rain everything looks pleasant but the state of our country is very gloomy general lee has surrendered to the victorious grant well if it will only hasten the conclusion of this war i am satisfied there has been something very strange in the whole affair to me and i can attribute it to nothing but the hand of providence working out some problem that has not yet been revealed to us poor erring mortals at the beginning of the struggle the minds of men their wills their self control seemed to be all taken from them in a passionate antagonism to the coming in president abraham lincoln our leaders to whom the people looked for wisdom led us into this perhaps the greatest error of the age we will not have this man to rule over us was their cry for years it has been stirring in the hearts of southern politicians that the north was enriched and built up by southern labor and wealth men's pockets were always appealed to and appealed to so constantly that an antagonism was excited which it has been impossible to allay they did not believe that the north would fight said robert toombes i will drink every drop of blood they will shed oh blinded men rivers deep and strong have been shed and where are we now a ruined subjugated people what will be our future is the question which now rests heavily upon the hearts of all this has been a month never to be forgotten two armies have surrendered the president of the united states has been assassinated richmond evacuated and davis president of the confederacy put to grief to flight the old flag has been raised again upon sumter and an armistice accepted
may 7 1865 sunday evening had company every day last week paroled soldiers returning to their homes last night a mr and mrs adams refugees from alberta who have been spending the time in eatonton called to stay all night i felt as though i could not take them in i had purposely kept in the back part of the house all the evening with my blinds down and door locked to keep from being troubled by soldiers and had just gone into my room with a light when some one knocked at the door and wanted shelter for himself and family i could not turn away women and children so i took them in found them very pleasant people they had government wagons along and he had them guarded all night i fear there was something in them which had been surrendered and belonged to the united states but he assured me that with the exception of the mules and wagon all belonged to himself he said that he left jeff davis at washington in this state on thursday morning last his enemies are in close pursuit of him offering a hundred thousand reward to his captors may 14 1865 mr knowles our circuit preacher came i like him we agree upon a good many contested topics he loves the old flag as well as myself and would be glad to see it floating where it ever has i had a long conversation with my man elbert to day about freedom and told him i was perfectly willing but wanted direction he says the yankees told major lee's servants they were all free but they had better remain where they were until it was all settled as it would be in a month's time we heard so many conflicting rumors we know not what to do but are willing to carry out the orders when we know them may 29 1865 dr williams from social circle came this morning to trade me a horse he tells me the people below are freeing their servants and allowing those to stay with them that will go on with their work and obey as usual what i shall do with mine is a question that troubles me day and night it is my last thought at night and the first in the morning i told them several days ago hey were free to do as they liked but it is my duty to make some provisions for them i thank god that they are freed and yet what can i do with them they are old and young not profitable to hire what provision can i make

august 2 1864 just as i got out of bed this morning aunt julia a slave called me to look down the road and see the soldiers i peeped through the blinds and there they were sure enough the yankees the blue coats i was not dressed the servant women came running in mistress they are coming they are coming they are riding into the lot there are two coming up the steps i bade rachel a slave fasten my room door and go to the front door and ask them what they wanted they did not wait for that but came in and asked why my door was fastened she told them that the white folks were not up they said they wanted breakfast and that quick too thug short for sugar the nickname of a little girl minnie minerva glass now mrs joe carey murphy of charlotte north carolina who had come to pass the night with sadai and sadai as well as myself were greatly alarmed as soon as i could get on my clothing i hastened to the kitchen to hurry up breakfast six of them were there talking with my women they asked about our soldiers and passing themselves off as wheeler's men said have you seen any of our men go by several of wheeler's men passed last evening who are you said i we are a portion of wheeler's men said one you look like yankees said i yes said one stepping up to me we are yankees did you ever see one before not for a long time i replied and none such as you these men mrs burge says further were raiders illinois and kentucky men of german origin they left after breakfast taking three of her best mules but doing no further injury to night captain smith of an alabama regiment and a squad of twenty men are camped opposite in the field they have all supped with me and i shall breakfast with them we have spent a pleasant evening with music and talk they have a prisoner along i can't help feeling sorry for him august 5 1864 mr ward has been robbed by the yankees of his watch pencil and shirt
jan 1st 1865 sunday pine bluff a beautiful clear day but none of us went to church sister was afraid of the bad roads metta mrs meals julia and i all sick i think i am taking measles jan 1 wednesday i am just getting well of measles and a rough time i had of it measles is no such small affair after all especially when aggravated by perpetual alarms of yankee raiders for the last week we have lived in a state of incessant fear all sorts of rumors come up the road and down it and we never know what to believe mett and i have received repeated letters from home urging our immediate return but of course it was impossible to travel while i was sick in bed and even now i am not strong enough to undertake that terrible journey across the burnt country again while i was ill home was the one thought that haunted my brain and if i ever do get back i hope i will have sense enough to stay there i don't think i ever suffered so much before in all my life and dread of the yankees raised my fever to such a pitch that i got no rest by night or day i used to feel very brave about yankees but since i have passed over sherman's track and seen what devastation they make i am so afraid of them that i believe i should drop down dead if one of the wretches should come into my presence i would rather face them anywhere than here in south west georgia for the horrors of the stockade have so enraged them that they will have no mercy on this country though they have brought it all on themselves the cruel monsters by refusing to exchange prisoners but it is horrible and a blot on the fair name of our confederacy mr robert bacon says he has accurate information that on the first of december 1864 there were 13,010 graves at anderson it is a dreadful record i shuddered as i passed the place on the cars with its tall gibbet full of horrible suggestiveness before the gate and its seething mass of humanity inside like a swarm of blue flies crawling over a grave it is said that the prisoners have organized their own code of laws among themselves and have established courts of justice before which they try offenders and that they sometimes condemn one of their number to death it is horrible to think of but what can we poor confederates do the yankees won't exchange prisoners and our own soldiers in the field don't fare much better than these poor creatures everybody is sorry for them and wouldn't keep them here a day if the government at washington didn't force them on us and yet they lay all the blame on us gen sherman told mr cuyler that he did not intend to leave so much as a blade of grass in south west georgia and dr janes told sister that he sherman said he would be obliged to send a formidable raid here in order to satisfy the clamors of his army though he himself the fiend sherman dreaded it on account of the horrors that would be committed what sherman dreads must indeed be fearful they say his soldiers have sworn that they will spare neither man woman nor child in all south west georgia it is only a question of time i suppose when all this will be done it begins to look as if the yankees can do whatever they please and go wherever they wish except to heaven i do fervently pray the good lord will give us rest from them there while i was at my worst mrs lawton came out with her brother in law mr george lawton and dr richardson medical director of bragg's army to make sister a visit the doctor came into my room and prescribed for me and did me more good by his cheerful talk than by his prescription he told me not to think about the yankees and said that he would come and carry me away himself before i should fall into their hands his medicine nearly killed me it was a big dose of opium and whisky that drove me stark crazy but when i came to myself i felt much better dr janes was my regular physician and had the merit of not giving much medicine but he frightened me horribly with his rumors about yankee raiders we are safe from them for the present at any rate i hope the swamps of the altamaha are so flooded that it would take an army of tritons to get over them now all this while that i have been sick metta has been going about enjoying herself famously there is a party at mr callaway's from americus which makes the neighborhood very gay everybody has called but i had to stay shut up in my room and miss all the fun brother troup has come down from macon on a short furlough bringing with him a maj higgins from mississippi who is much nicer than his name he is a cousin of dr richardson the rest of the family were out visiting all the morning leaving me with mrs meals who entertained me by reading aloud from hannah more as my eyes are still too weak from measles for me to read much myself i was glad to be edified by hannah more rather than be left to my own dull company the others came back at three and then just as we were sitting down to dinner the mallarys called and spent the rest of the day we ate no supper but went to bed on an eggnog at midnight jan 12 thursday the rest of them out visiting again all the morning leaving me to enjoy life with mrs meals and hannah more the edwin bacons and merrill callaway and his bride were invited to spend the evening with us and i found it rather dull i am just sick enough to be a bore to myself and everybody else merrill has married katy furlow of americus and she says that soon after my journey home last spring she met my young charlestonian and that he went into raptures over me and said he never was so delighted with anybody in his life so it seems the attraction was mutual i have a letter from tolie she is living in montgomery supremely happy of course as a bride should be she was sadly disappointed at my absence from the wedding the city is very gay she says and everybody inquiring about me and wanting me to come if i wasn't afraid the yankees might cut me off from home and sister too i would pick up and go now yankee yankee is the one detestable word always ringing in southern ears if all the words of hatred in every language under heaven were lumped together into one huge epithet of detestation they could not tell how i hate yankees they thwart all my plans murder my friends and make my life miserable jan 13th friday col blake a refugee from mississippi and his sister in law miss connor dined with us while the gentlemen lingered over their wine after dinner we ladies sat in the parlor making cigarettes for them the evening was spent at cards which bored me not a little for i hate cards they are good for nothing but to entertain stupid visitors with and col blake and miss connor do not belong in that category mett says she don't like the old colonel because he is too pompous but that amuses me and then he is such a gentleman the newspapers bring accounts of terrible floods all over the country three bridges are washed away on the montgomery west point r.r so that settles the question of going to montgomery for the present our fears about the yankees are quieted too there being none this side of the altamaha and the swamps impassable jan 14th saturday brother troup and maj higgins left for macon and sister drove to albany with them she expects to stay there till monday and then bring mrs sims out with her we miss maj higgins very much he was good company in spite of that horrible name jim chiles called after dinner with his usual budget of news and after him came albert bacon to offer us the use of his father's carriage while sister has hers in albany father keeps on writing for us to come home brother troup says he can send us across the country from macon in a government wagon with mr forline for an escort if the rains will ever cease but we can't go now on account of the bad roads and the floods up the country bridges are washed away in every direction and the water courses impassable jan 15th sunday went to church at mt enon with albert bacon and saw everybody it was pleasant to meet old friends but i could not help thinking of poor annie chiles's grave at the church door one missing in a quiet country neighborhood like this makes a great gap this was the sunday for dr hillyer to preach to the negroes and administer the communion to them they kept awake and looked very much edified while the singing was going on but most of them slept through the sermon the women were decked out in all their sunday finery and looked so picturesque and happy it is a pity that this glorious old plantation life should ever have to come to an end albert bacon dined with us and we spent the afternoon planning for a picnic at mrs henry bacon's lake on tuesday or wednesday the dear old lake i want to see it again before its shores are desecrated by yankee feet i wish sister would hurry home on account of the servants we can't take control over them and they won't do anything except just what they please as soon as she had gone mr ballou the overseer took himself off and only returned late this evening harriet mrs green butler's maid is the most trifling of the lot but i can stand anything from her because she refused to go off with the yankees when mrs butler had her in marietta last summer her mother went and tried to persuade harriet to go too but she said i loves miss julia a heap better'n i do you and remained faithful sister keeps her here because mrs butler is a refugee and without a home herself jan 16 monday sister has come back bringing dear little mrs sims with her metta and i are to spend next week in albany with mrs sims if we are not all water bound in the meantime at pine bluff the floods are subsiding up the country but the waters are raging down here flint river is out of its banks the low grounds are overflowed and the backwater has formed a lake between the negro quarter and the house that reaches to within a few yards of the door so much the better for us as kilpatrick and his raiders can never make their way through all these floods sister is greatly troubled about a difficulty two of her negroes jimboy and alfred have gotten into they are implicated with some others who are accused of stealing leather and attacking a white man alfred is a great big horrid looking creature more like an orang outang than a man though they say he is one of the most peaceable and humble negroes on the plantation and jimboy has never been known to get into any mischief before i hope there is some mistake though the negroes are getting very unruly since the yankees are so near jan 17 tuesday the river still rising and all the water courses so high that i am afraid the stage won't be able to pass between albany and thomasville and we sha'n't get our mail there is always something the matter to keep us from getting the mail at that little gum pond postoffice mrs sims is water bound with us and it is funny to hear her and mrs meals one a red hot episcopalian the other a red hot baptist trying to convert each other if the weather is any sign providence would seem to favor the baptists just now mrs sims almost made me cry with her account of poor mary millen her brother dead their property destroyed it is the same sad story over again that we hear so much of this dreadful war is bringing ruin upon so many happy homes jan 19 thursday i suffered a great disappointment to day mrs stokes walton gave a big dining everybody in the neighborhood almost everybody in the county that is anybody was invited i expected to wear that beautiful new dress that ran the blockade and i have had so few opportunities of showing all my preparations were made even the bows of ribbon pinned on my undersleeves but i was awakened at daylight by the pattering of rain on the roof and knew that the fun was up for me it was out of the question for one just up from an attack of measles to risk a ride of twelve miles in such a pouring rain so i had to content myself to stay at home with the two old ladies and be edified with disquisitions on the apostolic succession and baptism by immersion they are both good enough to be translated and i can't see why the dear little souls should be so disturbed about each other's belief once when mrs meals left the room for some purpose mrs sims whispered to me confidentially there is so little gentility among these dissenters that is one reason why i hate to see her among them i could hardly keep from laughing out but that is what a good deal of our religious differences amount to i confess to a strong prejudice myself in favor of the old church in which i was brought up still i don't think there ought to be any distinction of classes or races in religion we all have too little gentility in the sight of god for that i only wish i stood as well in the recording angel's book as many a poor negro that i know about noon a cavalryman stopped at the door and asked for dinner as we eat late and the man was in too big a hurry to wait sister sent him a cold lunch out in the entry it was raining very hard and the poor fellow was thoroughly drenched so after he had eaten sister invited him to come into the parlor and dry himself it came out in the course of conversation that he was from our own part of georgia and knew a number of good old wilkes county families he was on his way to the altamaha he said and promised to do his best to keep the raiders from getting to us jan 21 saturday albany ga i never in all my life knew such furious rains as we had last night it seemed as if the heavens themselves were falling upon us in addition to the uproar among the elements my slumbers were disturbed by frightful dreams about garnett twice during the night i dreamed that he was dead and in a state of corruption and i couldn't get anybody to bury him col avery and capt mackall were somehow mixed up in the horrid vision trying to help me but powerless to do so in the morning when we waked i found that metta also had dreamed of garnett's death i am not superstitious but i can't help feeling more anxious than usual to hear news of my darling brother the rain held up about dinner time and mrs sims determined to return to albany in spite of high waters and the threatening aspect of the sky we went five miles out of our way to find a place where we could ford wright's creek and even there the water was almost swimming mett and i were frightened out of our wits but mrs sims told us to shut our eyes and trust to providence and providence and uncle aby between them brought us through in safety at some places in the woods sheets of water full half a mile wide and from one to two feet deep were running across the road on their way to swell the flood in flint river sister sent a negro before us on a mule to see if the water courses were passable we had several bad scares but reached town in safety a little after dark jan 22 the rains returned with double fury in the night and continued all day if the stars in their courses fought against sisera it looks as if the heavens were doing as much for us against kilpatrick and his raiders there was no service at st paul's so mrs sims kept metta and me in the line of duty by reading aloud high church books to us they were very dull so i didn't hurt myself listening after dinner we read the church service and sang hymns until relieved by a call from our old friend capt hobbs jan 24 tuesday mr and mrs welsh spent the evening with us jim chiles came last night and sat until the chickens crowed for day although i like jimmy and enjoy his budget of news i would enjoy his visits more if he knew when to go away i never was so tired and sleepy in my life and cold too for we had let the fire go out as a hint when at last we went to our room i nearly died laughing at the way metta had maneuvered to save time she had loosened every button and string that she could get at without being seen while sitting in the parlor and had now only to give herself a good shake and she was ready for bed we spent the morning making calls with mrs sims and found among the refugees from south carolina a charming old lady mrs brisbane though past fifty she is prettier than many a woman of half her years and her manners would grace a court her father was an artist of note and she showed us some beautiful pictures painted by him after dinner we enjoyed some florida oranges sent by clinton spenser and they tasted very good in the absence of west india fruit jan 25 wednesday dined at judge vason's where there was a large company he is very hospitable and his house is always full of people albert bacon came in from gum pond and called in the afternoon bringing letters and the letters brought permission to remain in south west georgia as long as we please the panic about kilpatrick having died out i would like to be at home now if the journey were not such a hard one garnett and mrs elzey are both there and mary day is constantly expected i have not seen garnett for nearly three years he has resigned his position on gen gardiner's staff and is going to take command of a battalion of galvanized yankees with the rank of lieutenant colonel i don't like the scheme i have no faith in yankees of any sort especially these miserable turncoats that are ready to sell themselves to either side there isn't gold enough in existence to galvanize one of them into a respectable confederate jan 27 friday mett and i were busy returning calls all the morning and mrs sims always in a hurry sent us up to dress for mrs westmoreland's party as soon as we had swallowed our dinner so we were ready by dusk and had to sit waiting with our precious finery on until our escorts came for us at nine o'clock mrs sims is one of these fidgety little bodies that is always in a rush about everything she gallops through the responses in church so fast that she always comes out long ahead of everybody else and even eats so fast that metta and i nearly choke ourselves trying to keep up with her we hardly ever get enough as we are ashamed to sit at table too long after she has finished i tried one day when i was very hungry to keep up with her in eating a waffle but before i had got mine well buttered hers was gone she is such a nice housekeeper too and has such awfully good things that it is tantalizing not to be able to take time to enjoy them the party was delightful albany is so full of charming refugees and confederate officers and their families that there is always plenty of good company whatever else may be lacking i danced three sets with joe godfrey but i don't like the square dances very much the prince imperial is too slow and stately and so complicated that the men never know what to do with themselves even the lancers are tame in comparison with a waltz or a galop i love the galop and the deux temps better than any we kept it up till two o'clock in the morning and then walked home while going our rounds in the morning we found a very important person in peter louis a paroled yankee prisoner in the employ of capt bonham the captain keeps him out of the stockade feeds and clothes him and in return reaps the benefit of his skill peter is a french yankee a shoemaker by trade and makes as beautiful shoes as i ever saw imported from france my heart quite softened towards him when i saw his handiwork and little mrs sims was so overcome that she gave him a huge slice of her confederate fruit cake i talked french with him which pleased him greatly and mett and i engaged him to make us each a pair of shoes i will feel like a lady once more with good shoes on my feet i expect the poor yank is glad to get away from anderson on any terms although matters have improved somewhat with the cool weather the tales that are told of the condition of things there last summer are appalling mrs brisbane heard all about it from father hamilton a roman catholic priest from macon who has been working like a good samaritan in those dens of filth and misery it is a shame to us protestants that we have let a roman catholic get so far ahead of us in this work of charity and mercy mrs brisbane says father hamilton told her that during the summer the wretched prisoners burrowed in the ground like moles to protect themselves from the sun it was not safe to give them material to build shanties as they might use it for clubs to overcome the guard these underground huts he said were alive with vermin and stank like charnel houses many of the prisoners were stark naked having not so much as a shirt to their backs he told a pitiful story of a pole who had no garment but a shirt and to make it cover him the better he put his legs into the sleeves and tied the tail round his neck the others guyed him so on his appearance and the poor wretch was so disheartened by suffering that one day he deliberately stepped over the deadline and stood there till the guard was forced to shoot him but what i can't understand is that a pole of all people in the world should come over here and try to take away our liberty when his own country is in the hands of oppressors one would think that the poles of all nations in the world ought to sympathize with a people fighting for their liberties father hamilton said that at one time the prisoners died at the rate of 150 a day and he saw some of them die on the ground without a rag to lie on or a garment to cover them dysentery was the most fatal disease and as they lay on the ground in their own excrements the smell was so horrible that the good father says he was often obliged to rush from their presence to get a breath of pure air it is dreadful my heart aches for the poor wretches yankees though they are and i am afraid god will suffer some terrible retribution to fall upon us for letting such things happen if the yankees ever should come to south west georgia and go to anderson and see the graves there god have mercy on the land and yet what can we do the yankees themselves are really more to blame than we for they won't exchange these prisoners and our poor hard pressed confederacy has not the means to provide for them when our own soldiers are starving in the field oh what a horrible thing war is when stripped of all its pomp and circumstance jan 28 saturday we left albany at an early hour albert bacon rode out home in the carriage with us and i did the best i could for him by pretending to be too sleepy to talk and so leaving him free to devote himself to mett fortunately the roads have improved since last saturday and we were not so long on the way we found sister busy with preparations for julia's birthday party which came off in the afternoon all the children in the neighborhood were invited and most of the grown people too the youngsters were turned loose in the backyard to play king's base miley bright c and before we knew it we grown people found ourselves as deep in the fun as the children in the midst of it all a servant came up on horseback with a letter for sister it proved to be a note from capt hines bespeaking her hospitality for gen sam jones and staff and of course she couldn't refuse though the house was crowded to overflowing already she had hardly finished reading when a whole cavalcade of horses and government wagons came rattling up to the door and the general and one of his aides helped two ladies and their children to alight from an ambulance in which they were traveling when they saw what a party we had on hand they seemed a little embarrassed but sister laughed away their fears and sent the children out to join the others in the backyard and left the ladies who were introduced as mrs jones and mrs creighton with their escorts in the parlor while she went out to give orders about supper and make arrangements for their accommodation mrs meals metta and i hustled out of our rooms and doubled up with sister and the children everybody was stowed away somewhere when just before bedtime two more aides capt warwick of richmond and capt frazer of charleston rode up and were invited to come in though the house was so crowded that sister had not even a pallet on the floor to offer them all she could do was to give them some pillows and tell them they were welcome to stay in the parlor if they could make themselves comfortable there people are used to putting up with any sort of accommodations these times and they seemed very glad of the shelter they said it was a great deal better than camping out in the wagons as they had been doing and with the help of the parlor rugs and their overcoats and army blankets they could make themselves very comfortable they were regular thoroughbreds we could see and capt frazer one of the handsomest men i ever laid my eyes on a great big splendid fair haired giant that might have been a viking leader if he had lived a thousand years ago sister has been so put out by mr ballou that i don't see how she could keep her temper well enough to be polite to anybody he has packed up and taken himself off leaving her without an overseer after giving but one day's notice and she has the whole responsibility of the plantation and all these negroes on her hands it was disgraceful for him to treat her so and brother troup off at the war too jan 29 sunday breakfast early so as to let our general and staff proceed on their way as they said they wanted to make an early start gen jones has recently been appointed commandant of the department of south georgia and florida with headquarters at tallahassee it was nearly eleven o'clock before they got off mr robert bacon says he met them on their way and they told him they were so pleased with their entertainment at sister's that they wished they could have staid a day or two longer i had a good long talk with the two young captains before they left and they were just as nice as they could be we found that we had a number of common friends and capt warwick knows quite well the miss lou randolph in richmond that garnett writes so much about and rosalie beirne too just before bedtime we were startled by heavy steps and a loud knocking at the front door having no white man within three miles even an overseer we were a little startled but mustered courage sister mett and i followed by two or three of the negroes to go to the door instead of a stray yankee or a squad of deserters we confronted a smart young confederate officer in such a fine new uniform that the sight of it nearly took our breath away he said he was going to the cochran plantation but got lost in the pond back of our house and had come in to inquire his way sister invited him into the sitting room and he sat there talking with us till one of the servants could saddle a mule and go with him to show him the road sister said she felt mean for not inviting him to spend the night but she was too tired and worried to entertain another guest now if the fate of the confederacy depended on it his uniform was too fresh and new anyway to look very heroic jan 31 tuesday sister and i spent the morning making calls at the tithing agent's office where she stopped to see about her taxes we saw a battalion of wheeler's cavalry which is to be encamped in our neighborhood for several weeks their business is to gather up and take care of broken down horses so as to fit them for use again in baggage trains and the like at the postoffice a letter was given me which i opened and read thinking it was for me it began dear ideal and was signed yours forever i thought at first that capt hobbs or albert bacon was playing a joke on me but on making inquiry at the office i learned that there is a cracker girl named fanny andrews living down somewhere near gum pond for whom no doubt the letter was intended so i remailed it to her as we were sitting in the parlor after supper there was another lumbering noise of heavy feet on the front steps but it was caused by a very different sort of visitor from the one we had sunday night a poor cadaverous fellow came limping into the room and said he was a wounded soldier looking for work as an overseer he gave his name as etheridge and i suspect from his manner that he is some poor fellow who has seen better days sister engaged him on the spot for one month as an experiment though she is afraid he will not be equal to the work
dec 24 1864 saturday here we are in macon at last and this is the first chance i have had at my journal since we left home last monday father went with us to barnett and then turned us over to fred who had come up from augusta to meet us and travel with us as far as mayfield at camack where we changed cars we found the train literally crammed with people going on the same journey with ourselves since the destruction of the georgia the macon western and the central railroads by sherman's army the whole tide of travel between the eastern and western portions of our poor little confederacy flows across the country from mayfield to gordon mett and i with two other ladies whom we found on the train at camack were the first to venture across the gap 65 miles of bad roads and worse conveyances through a country devastated by the most cruel and wicked invasion of modern times as we entered the crowded car two young officers gave up their seats to us and saw that we were made comfortable while fred was out looking after the baggage near us sat a handsome middle aged gentleman in the uniform of a colonel with a pretty young girl beside him whom we at once spotted as his bride they were surrounded by a number of officers and the bride greatly amused us in the snatches of their conversation we overheard by her extreme bookishness she was clearly just out of school the only other lady on the car was closely occupied with the care of her husband a wounded confederate officer whom we afterwards learned was maj bonham of south carolina it is only eleven miles from camack to mayfield but the road was so bad and the train so heavy that we were nearly two hours in making the distance some of the seats were without backs and some without bottoms and the roadbed so uneven that in places the car tilted from side to side as if it was going to upset and spill us all out we ate dinner on the cars that is fred ate while metta and i were watching the people the weather was very hot and i sweltered like a steam engine under the overload of clothing i had put on to save room in my trunk at three o'clock in the afternoon we reached mayfield a solitary shanty at the present terminus of the r r fred had sent mr belisle one of his men ahead to engage a conveyance and he met us with a little spring wagon which he said would take us on to sparta that night for forty dollars it had no top but was the choice of all the vehicles there for it had springs of which none of the others could boast there was the mail hack which had the advantage of a cover but could not carry our trunks and really looked as if it were too decrepit to bear the weight of the mail bags we mounted our little wagon and the others were soon all filled so full that they looked like delegations from the old woman that lived in a shoe and crowds of pedestrians unable to find a sticking place on tongue or axle plodded along on foot the colonel and his wife were about to get into a rough old plantation wagon already overloaded but fred said she was too pretty to ride in such a rattle trap and offered her a seat in ours which was gladly accepted we alsomade room for dr shine one of the officers of their party who we afterwards found out was a friend of belle randolph about a mile from mayfield we stopped at a forlorn country tavern where fred turned us over to mr belisle and went in to spend the night there so as to return to augusta by the next train i felt rather desolate after his departure but we soon got into conversation with the colonel and his bride the gentlemen who were following on foot joined in and we sang rebel songs and became very sociable together we had not gone far when big drops of rain began to fall from an angry black cloud that had been gradually creeping upon us from the northwest the bride raised a little fancy silk parasol that made the rest of us laugh while metta and i took off our hats and began to draw on shawls and hoods and a young captain who was plodding on foot behind us hastened to offer his overcoat when we found that he had a wounded arm disabled by a yankee bullet we tried to make room for him in the wagon but it was impossible to squeeze another person into it ralph the driver had been turned afoot to make room for dr shine and was walking ahead to act as guide in the darkness just after nightfall we came to a public house five miles from sparta where the old man lives from whom our wagons were hired and we stopped to pay our fare and get supper if anybody wanted it he is said to be fabulously rich and owns all the land for miles around but he don't live like it he is palsied and bed ridden but so eager after money that guests are led to his bedside to pay their reckoning into his own hands mett and i staid in the wagon and sent mr belisle to settle for us but the gentlemen of our party who went in said it was dreadful to see how his trembling old fingers would clutch at the bills they paid him and the suspicious looks he would cast around to make sure he was not being cheated they could talk of nothing else for some time after they came out we stopped at this place nearly an hour while the horses were being changed and the drivers getting their supper there was a fine grove around the house but the wind made a dismal howling among the branches and ominous mutterings of distant thunder added to our uneasiness large fires were burning in front of the stables and threw a weird glare upon the groups of tired soldiers gathered round them smoking their pipes and cooking their scanty rations and the flashing uniforms of confederate officers hurrying in and out added to the liveliness of the scene many of them came to our wagon to see if they could do anything for us and their presence brave fellows gave me a comfortable feeling of safety and protection dr shine brought us a toddy and the colonel and the captain would have smothered us under overcoats and army blankets if we had let them when the horses were ready we jogged on again towards sparta which seemed to recede as we advanced dr shine who was driving didn't know the road and had to guide the horses by ralph's direction as he walked ahead and sung out now pull to de right now go straight ahead take keer marster dar's a bad hole ter yo lef and so on till all at once the long threatened rain began to pour down and everything was in confusion somebody cried out in the darkness confound sparta will we never get there and ralph made us all laugh again with his answer yessir yessir we's right in de subjues er de town now and sure enough the next turn in the road revealed the lights of the village glimmering before us we drove directly to mr william simpson's and when metta and i had gotten out the wagon went on with its other passengers to the hotel we met with such a hearty reception from belle and her mother that for the moment all our troubles were forgotten a big cheerful fire was blazing in the sitting room and as i sank into a soft easy chair i felt my first sensation of fatigue next morning the sky was overcast everything outside was wet and dripping and a cold wind had sprung up that rattled the naked boughs of a great elm heavy with raindrops against our window as soon as the houseboy had kindled a fire mrs simpson's maid came to help us dress and brought a toddy of fine old peach brandy sweetened with white sugar i made mett take a big swig of it to strengthen her for the journey as she seemed very weak but not being accustomed to the use of spirits it upset her so that she couldn't walk across the floor i was frightened nearly out of my wits but she soon recovered and felt much benefited by her unintentional spree at which we had a good laugh we had a royal breakfast and while we were eating it mr belisle who had spent the night at the hotel drove up with a four mule wagon in which he had engaged places for us and our trunks to milledgeville at seventy five dollars apiece it was a common plantation wagon without cover or springs and i saw mr simpson shake his head ominously as we jingled off to take up more passengers at the hotel there were several other conveyances of the same sort already overloaded waiting in front of the door and a number of travelers standing on the sidewalk rushed forward to secure places in ours as soon as we halted the first to climb in was a poor sick soldier of whom no pay was demanded next came a captain of texas rangers then a young lieutenant in a shabby uniform that had evidently seen very hard service and after him our handsome young captain of the night before he grumbled a little at the looks of the conveyance but on finding we were going to ride in it dashed off to secure a seat for himself while we sat waiting there i overheard a conversation between a countryman and a nervous traveler that was not calculated to relieve my mind in answer to some inquiry about the chances for hiring a conveyance at milledgeville i heard the countryman say milledgeville's like hell you kin get thar easy enough but gittin out agin would beat the devil himself i didn't hear the traveler's next remark but it must have been something about metta and me for i heard the countryman answer ef them ladies ever gits to gordon they'll be good walkers sherman's done licked that country clean d n me ef you kin hire so much as a nigger an a wheelbarrer i was so uneasy that i asked mr belisle to go and question the man further because i knew that after her long attack of typhoid fever last summer metta couldn't stand hardships as well as i could when the captain heard me he spoke up immediately and said don't give yourselves the slightest uneasiness young ladies i'll see that you get safe to gordon if you will trust to me he spoke with an air of authority that was reassuring and when he sprang down from the wagon and joined a group of officers on the sidewalk i knew that something was in the wind after a whispered consultation among them and a good deal of running back and forth he came to us and said that they had decided to press the wagon in case of necessity to take the party to gordon and all being now ready we moved out of sparta we soon became very sociable with our new companions though not one of us knew the other even by name mett and i saw that they were all dying with curiosity about us and enjoyed keeping them mystified the captain said he was from baltimore and it was a sufficient introduction when we found that he knew the elzeys and the irwins and that handsome ed carey i met in montgomery last winter who used to be always telling me how much i reminded him of his cousin connie just beyond sparta we were halted by one of the natives who instead of paying forty dollars for his passage to the agent at the hotel like the rest of us had walked ahead and made a private bargain with uncle grief the driver for ten dollars this yankee trick raised a laugh among our impecunious rebs and the lieutenant who was just out of a northern prison and very short of funds thanked him for the lesson and declared he meant to profit by it the next chance he got the newcomer proved to be a very amusing character and we nicknamed him sam weller on account of his shrewdness and rough and ready wit he was dressed in a coarse home made suit but was evidently something of a dandy as his shirt front sported a broad cotton rude edged with home made cotton lace he was a rebel soldier he said went in at the fust pop and been a fightin ever since till the yankees caught me here home on furlough and wouldn't turn me loose till ihad took their infernal oath beg your pardon ladies the jig's pretty nigh up anyway so i don't reckon it'll make much diff'rence he told awful tales about the things sherman's robbers had done it made my blood boil to hear them and when the captain asked him if some of the rascals didn't get caught themselves sometimes stragglers and the like he answered with a wink that said more than words yes our folks took lots of prisoners more'n'll ever be heard of agin what became of them asked the lieutenant sent em to macon double quick was the laconic reply got em thar in less'n half an hour how did they manage it continued the lieutenant in a tone that showed he understood sam's metaphor just took em out in the woods and lost em he replied in his jerky laconic way ever heerd o losin men lady he added turning to me with an air of grim waggery that made my flesh creep for after all even yankees are human beings though they don't always behave like it yes i said i had heard of it but thought it a horrible thing i don't b'lieve in losin em neither as a gener'l thing he went on i don't think it's right principul and i wouldn't lose one myself but when i see what they have done to these people round here i can't blame em for losin every devil of em they kin git their hands on what was the process of losing asked the captain did they manage the business with fire arms sometimes when they was in a hurry mr weller explained with that horrible grim irony of his the guns would go off an shoot em in spite of all that our folks could do but most giner'ly they took the grapevine road in the fust patch of woods they come to an soon as ever they got sight of a tree with a grape vine on it it's cur'ous how skeered their hosses would git you couldn't keep em from runnin away no matter what you done an they never run fur before their heads was caught in a grape vine and they would stand thar dancin on nothin till they died did you ever hear of anybody dancin on nothin before lady turning to me i said he ought to be ashamed to tell it even a yankee was entitled to protection when a prisoner of war but these fellows wasn't regular prisoners of war lady said the sick soldier they were thieves and houseburners and i couldn't but feel there was something in that view of it about three miles from sparta we struck the burnt country as it is well named by the natives and then i could better understand the wrath and desperation of these poor people i almost felt as if i should like to hang a yankee myself there was hardly a fence left standing all the way from sparta to gordon the fields were trampled down and the road was lined with carcasses of horses hogs and cattle that the invaders unable either to consume or to carry away with them had wantonly shot down to starve out the people and prevent them from making their crops the stench in some places was unbearable every few hundred yards we had to hold our noses or stop them with the cologne mrs elzey had given us and it proved a great boon the dwellings that were standing all showed signs of pillage and on every plantation we saw the charred remains of the gin house and packing screw while here and there lone chimney stacks sherman's sentinels told of homes laid in ashes the infamous wretches i couldn't wonder now that these poor people should want to put a rope round the neck of every red handed devil of them they could lay their hands on hay ricks and fodder stacks were demolished corn cribs were empty and every bale of cotton that could be found was burnt by the savages i saw no grain of any sort except little patches they had spilled when feeding their horses and which there was not even a chicken left in the country to eat a bag of oats might have lain anywhere along the road without danger from the beasts of the field though i cannot say it would have been safe from the assaults of hungry man crowds of soldiers were tramping over the road in both directions it was like traveling through the streets of a populous town all day they were mostly on foot and i saw numbers seated on the roadside greedily eating raw turnips meat skins parched corn anything they could find even picking up the loose grains that sherman's horses had left i felt tempted to stop and empty the contents of our provision baskets into their laps but the dreadful accounts that were given of the state of the country before us made prudence get the better of our generosity the roads themselves were in a better condition than might have been expected and we traveled at a pretty fair rate our four mules being strong and in good working order when we had made about half the distance to milledgeville it began to rain so the gentlemen cut down saplings which they fitted in the form of bows across the body of the wagon and stretching the lieutenant's army blanket over it made a very effectual shelter our next halt was near a dilapidated old house where there was a fine well of water the yankees had left it i suppose because they couldn't carry it away here we came up with a wagon on which were mounted some of the people we had seen on the cars the day before they stopped to exchange experiences offered us a toddy and brought us water in a beautiful calabash gourd with a handle full three feet long we admired it so much that one of them laughingly proposed to capture it for us but we told them we didn't care to imitate sherman's manners a mile or two further on we were hailed by a queer looking object sitting on a log in the corner of a half burnt fence it was wrapped up in a big white blanket that left nothing else visible except a round red face and a huge pair of feet before anybody could decide whether the apparition was a ghost from the lower regions or an escaped lunatic from the state asylum in his nightgown sam weller jumped up exclaiming galvanized galvanized stop driver a galvanized yankee as soon as uncle grief had brought his mules to a halt the strange figure shuffled up to the side of the wagon and began to plead piteously in broken dutch to be taken in he was shaking with a common ague fit and though we couldn't help feeling sorry for him he looked so comical as he stood there with his blanket drawn round him like a winding sheet and his little red dutch face peering out at us with such an expression of exaggerated and needless terror that it was hard to repress a smile the captain was about to order uncle grief to drive on without taking any further notice of him but sam weller assured us that the country people would certainly hang him if they should catch him away from his command they were too exasperated to make any distinction between a galvanized and any other sort of a yankee and to tell the truth i think myself if there is any difference at all it is in favor of those who remain true to their own cause the kind hearted lieutenant took his part mett and i seconded him and the poor creature was allowed to climb into our wagon where he curled himself up on a pile of fodder beside our sick soldier who didn't seem to relish the companionship very much though he said nothing but sam weller couldn't let him rest and immediately began to berate him for his imprudence in straggling off from his command at the risk of getting himself hanged and to entertain him with enlivening descriptions of the art of dancin on nothin and the various methods of getting lost all at once he came to a sudden stop in his tirade and asked iss you cot any money wappy nein ich cot no more ash den thaler quaked hans then pulling a fat roll of change bills out of his pocket he sam handed them to the dutchman saying well here's shin plasters enough to cover you better than that there blanket if you want them hans grabbed the money which was increased by small contributions from the rest of us not that we thought his enlistment in the confederate army counted for anything but we felt sorry for him because he was sick and a stranger after all what can these ignorant foreigners be expected to know or care about our quarrel soon after this we came to a pretty clear stream where uncle grief stopped to water his horses and we decided to eat our dinner those of our companions who had anything to eat at all were provided only with army rations so mett and i shared with them the good things we had brought from home we offered some to hans and this started sam off again now wappy see that he cried the rebel ladies feed you remember that the next time you go to burn a house down or steal a rebel lady's watch i say he shouted putting his lips to hans's ear as the dutchman seemed not to understand remember how the rebel ladies fed you when you turn yank agin and go to drivin women out o doors and stealin their clothes fortunately for wappy's peace of mind he didn't know enough english to take in the long list of yankee misdeeds that sam continued to recount for his benefit although he assured us that he could unterstant vat man say to him besser als he could dalk himselbst the captain suspected him of putting on and laughed at metta and me for wasting sympathy on him but the lieutenant shared our feelings and i liked him for it just before reaching milledgeville sam weller got down to walk to his home which he said was about two miles back from the highway come wappy he said as he was climbing down if you will go home with me i will take care of you and put you in a horspittle where you won't be in no danger of gittin lost can you valk doo milsh hans replied in the affirmative and scrambled down with a deal of groaning and quaking sam and the lieutenant assisted him with much real gentleness and when he was on the ground he tried to make a speech thanking the laties unt shentlemansh but it was in such bad english that we couldn't understand now don't lose the poor wretch i said to mr weller as they moved off together no no miss i won't do that he answered in a tone of such evident sincerity that i felt hans was safe in the care of this strange contradictory being who could talk so like a savage and yet be capable of such real kindness fortunately for wappy's peace of mind he didn't know enough english to take in the long list of yankee misdeeds that sam continued to recount for his benefit although he assured us that he could

sincerity that i felt hans was safe in the care of this strange contradictory being who could talk so like a savage and yet be capable of such real kindness after a hurried consultation with the other gentlemen of our party they all collected round our wagon and informed us that they had pressed it into service to take us to gordon and we were to go on to scotsborough that night when all the baggage was in the vehicle was so heavily loaded that not only the servants had to walk but the gentlemen of the party could only ride by turns one or two at a time our sick soldier was left at the hospital and the bride's big trunks that i wouldn't have believed all the women in the confederacy had clothes enough to fill were piled up in front to protect us against the wind uncle grief looked the embodiment of his name while these preparations were going on but a tip of ten dollars from each of us and the promise of a letter to his master relieving him from all blame quickly overcame his scruples night closed in soon after we left milledgeville and it began to rain in earnest then we lost the road and as if that were not enough the bride dropped her parasol and we had to stop there in the rain to look for it a new silk parasol that cost four or five hundred dollars was too precious to lose the colonel and the captain went back half a mile to get a torch and after all found the parasol lying right under her feet in the body of the wagon about nine o'clock we reached scotsborough the little american cranford where the butlers used to have their summer home like mrs gaskell's delightful little borough it is inhabited chiefly by aristocratic widows and old maids who rarely had their quiet lives disturbed by any event more exciting than a church fair till sherman's army marched through and gave them such a shaking up that it will give them something to talk about the rest of their days dr shine and the texas captain had gone ahead of the wagon and made arrangements for our accommodation the night was very dismal and when we drew up in front of the little inn and saw a big lightwood fire blazing in the parlor chimney i thought i had never seen anything so bright and comfortable before when mrs palmer the landlady learned who metta and i were she fairly hugged us off our feet and declared that mrs troup butler's sisters were welcome to her house and everything in it and then she bustled off with her daughter jenny to make ready their own chamber for our use she could not give us any supper because the yankees had taken all her provisions but she brought out a jar of pickles that had been hidden up the chimney and gave us the use of her dining table and dishes such of them as the yankees had left to spread our lunch on while charles and crockett the servants of dr shine and the colonel were unpacking our baskets in the dining room all our party assembled in the little parlor the colonel was made master of ceremonies and a general introduction took place the texas captain gave his name as jarman the shabby lieutenant in the war worn uniform all honor to it was mr foster of florence ala the baltimorean was capt mackall cousin of the commandant at macon and the colonel himself had been a member of the confederate congress but resigned to go into the army the only place for a brave man in these times so we all knew each other at last and had a good laugh together over the secret curiosity that had been devouring each of us about our traveling companions for the last twenty four hours presently crockett announced supper and we went into the dining room we had some real coffee a luxury we owed the bride but there was only one spoon to all the company so she arranged that she should pour out the coffee i should stir each cup and mett pass them to the guests with the assurance that the cup was made sweeter by the magic of three pair of fair hands then mrs palmer's jar of pickles was brought out and presented with a little tableau scene she had made up beforehand even coaching me as to the pretty speeches i was to make i felt very silly but i hoped the others were too hungry to notice supper over we returned to the parlor and i never spent a more delightful evening riding along in the wagon we had amused ourselves by making up impromptu couplets to the confederate toast and now that we were comfortably housed i thanked capt jarman and dr shine for their efforts in a pair of impromptu verses to the same air this started up a rivalry in verse making each one trying to outdo the other in the absurdity of their composition and some of them were very funny when we broke up for the night there were more theatricals planned by the bride who disposed a white scarf round her head placed metta and me one on each side of her so as to make a sort of tableau vivant on the order of a three graces or a faith hope and charity group and backed slowly out of the room bowing and singing good night she really was so pretty and girlish that she could carry off anything with grace but i hadn't that excuse and never felt so foolish in my life mrs palmer's chamber in which metta and i were to sleep was a shed room of not very inviting aspect but the poor woman had done her best for us and we were too tired to be critical when i had put my clothes off and started to get into bed i found there was but one sheet and that looked as if half of sherman's army might have slept in it mett was too dead sleepy to care shut your eyes and go it blind she said and suiting the action to the word tumbled into bed without looking and was asleep almost by the time she had touched the pillow i tried to follow her example but it was no use the weather had begun to turn very cold and the scanty supply of bedclothes the yankees had left mrs palmer was not enough to keep me warm then it began to rain in torrents and presently i felt a cold shower bath descending on me through the leaky roof metta's side of the bed was comparatively dry and she waked up just enough to pull the cotton bedquilt that was our only covering over her head and then went stolidly to sleep again meanwhile the storm increased till it was terrible the rain seemed to come down in a solid sheet and i thought the old house would be torn from its foundations by the fierce wind that swept over it the solitary pine knot that had been our only light went out and left us in total darkness but i was getting so drenched where i lay that i was obliged to move so i groped my way to an old lounge that stood in a somewhat sheltered corner by the fireplace and covered myself with the clothing i had taken off the lounge was so narrow that i couldn't turn over without causing my cover to fall over on the floor so i lay stiff as a corpse all night catching little uneasy snatches of sleep between the wildest bursts of the storm early in the morning mrs palmer and jenny came in with bowls and pans to put under the leaks there were so many that we were quite shingled over as we lay in bed with a tin roof of pots and pans and they made such a rattling as the water pattered into them that neither of us could sleep any more for laughing the colonel had given us instructions over night to be ready for an early start so when another pine knot had been lighted on the hearth we made haste to dress before it burned out mrs palmer had contrived to spread us a scanty breakfast of hot waffles fresh sausages and parched wheat coffee but the bride as is the way of brides was so long in getting ready that it was nearly ten o'clock before we started on our journey it had stopped raining by this time but the weather was so cold and cloudy that i found my two suits of clothing very comfortable a bitter wind was blowing and on all sides were to be seen shattered boughs and uprooted trees effects of the past night's storm the gentlemen had had all the baggage placed in front and the floor of the wagon covered with fodder where we could sit and find some protection from the wind i should have felt tolerably comfortable if i had not seen that metta was feeling ill though she kept up her spirits and did not complain she said she had a headache and i noticed that her face was covered with ugly red splotches which i supposed were caused by the wind chapping her skin we put our shawls over our heads but the wind played such antics with them that they were not much protection the bride instead of crouching down with us mounted on top of a big trunk the coldest place she could find and cheered us with the comforting announcement that she was going to have pneumonia it was beautiful to see how the big handsome colonel devoted himself to her and i half suspect that was at the bottom of her pneumonia scare at least we heard no more of it i offered her some of our brandy and the doctor made her a toddy but she couldn't drink it because it was grape and not peach everybody seemed disposed to be silent and out of sorts at first except metta and me who had not yet had adventures enough to surfeit us and we kept on talking till we got the rest of them into a good humor we made the gentlemen tell us what their various professions were before the war and were delighted to learn that our dear colonel was a lawyer we told him that our father was a judge and that we loved lawyers better than anybody else except soldiers whereupon he laughed and advised the other gentlemen who were all unmarried to take to the law i said that about lawyers for the doctor's benefit because he looked all the time as if he were afraid one of us was going to fall in love with him i laughed and told mett that it was she that scared him with her hair all cropped off from fever and that dreadful splotched complexion he heaped coals of fire on my head soon after when i was cowering down in the body of the wagon nearly dead with cold by inviting me to get out and warm myself by taking a walk my feet were so cold that they felt like lifeless clods and i could hardly stand on them when i first stepped to the ground but a brisk walk of two miles warmed me up so pleasantly that i was sorry when a succession of mud holes forced me to get back into the wagon about noon we struck the milledgeville gordon r.r near a station which the yankees had burnt and a mill near by they had destroyed also out of pure malice to keep the poor people of the country from getting their corn ground there were several crossroads at the burnt mill and we took the wrong one and got into somebody's cornfield where we found a little crib whose remoteness seemed to have protected it from the greed of the invaders we were about to press a few ears for our hungry mules when we spied the owner coming across the fields and waited for him the captain asked if he would sell us a little provender for our mules but he gave such a pitiful account of the plight in which sherman had left him that we felt as mean as a lot of thieving yankees ourselves for having thought of disturbing his property he was very polite and walked nearly a mile in the biting wind to put us back in the right road three miles from gordon we came to commissioners creek of which we had heard awful accounts all along the road it was particularly bad just at this time on account of the heavy rain and had overflowed the swamp for nearly two miles porters with heavy packs on their backs were wading through the sloughs and soldiers were paddling along with their legs bare and their breeches tied up in a bundle on their shoulders they were literal sans culottes some one who had just come from the other side advised us to unload the wagon and make two trips of it as it was doubtful whether the mules could pull through with such a heavy load the yankees had thrown dead cattle in the ford so that we had to drive about at random in the mud and water to avoid these uncanny obstructions our gentlemen however concluded that we had not time to make two trips so they all piled into the wagon at once and trusted to providence for the result we came near upsetting twice and the water was so deep in places that we had to stand on top of the trunks to keep our feet dry safely over the swamp we dined on the scraps left in our baskets which afforded but a scanty meal the cold and wind had increased so that we could hardly keep our seats but the roads improved somewhat as we advanced and the aspect of the country was beautiful in spite of all that the vandalism of war had done to disfigure its fair face every few hundred yards we crossed beautiful clear streams with luxuriant swamps along their borders gay with shining evergreens and bright winter berries but when we struck the central r.r at gordon the desolation was more complete than anything we had yet seen there was nothing left of the poor little village but ruins charred and black as yankee hearts the pretty little dépot presented only a shapeless pile of bricks capped by a crumpled mass of tin that had once covered the roof the r.r track was torn up and the iron twisted into every conceivable shape some of it was wrapped round the trunks of trees as if the cruel invaders not satisfied with doing all the injury they could to their fellowmen must spend their malice on the innocent trees of the forest whose only fault was that they grew on southern soil many fine young saplings were killed in this way but the quickest and most effective method of destruction was to lay the iron across piles of burning cross ties and while heated in the flames it was bent and warped so as to be entirely spoiled a large force is now at work repairing the road as the repairs advance a little every day the place for meeting the train is constantly changing and not always easy to find we floundered around in the swamps a long time and at last found our train in the midst of a big swamp with crowds of people waiting around on little knolls and islands till the cars should be opened each group had its own fire and tents were improvised out of shawls and blankets so that the scene looked like a gypsy camp here we met again all the people we had seen on the train at camack besides a great many others judge baker and the bonhams arrived a few minutes behind us after having met with all sorts of disasters at commissioners creek which they crossed at a worse ford than the one we had taken we found a dry place near the remains of a half burned fence where charles and crockett soon had a rousing fire and we sat round it talking over our adventures till the car was ready for us there was a great scramble to get aboard and we were all crowded into a little car not much bigger than an ordinary omnibus mett and i were again indebted to the kindness of soldier boys for a seat we had about the best one in the car which is not saying much with the people jostling and pressing against us from the crowded aisle but as we had only 16 miles to go we thought we could stand it with a good grace metta's indisposition had been increasing all day and she was now so ill that i was seriously uneasy but all i could do was to place her next to the window where she would not be so much disturbed by the crowd we steamed along smoothly enough for an hour or two until just at nightfall when within two miles of macon the train suddenly stopped and we were told that we should have to spend the night there or walk to town the bridge over walnut creek which had been damaged by stoneman's raiders last summer was so weakened by the storm of the night before that it threatened to give way and it was impossible to run the train across we were all in despair metta was really ill and the rest of us worn out with fatigue and loss of sleep besides being half famished our provisions were completely exhausted the fine grape brandy mother had put in the basket was all gone looted i suppose by the servants and we had no other medicine a good many of the men decided to walk among them our lieutenant who was on his way home just out of a yankee prison and eager to spend christmas with his family the dear good hearted fellow seemed loath to leave us in that plight and offered to stay and see us through if i wanted him but i couldn't impose on his kindness to that extent besides we still had the captain and the colonel and all the rest of them and i knew we would never lack for attention or protection as long as there was a confederate uniform in sight capt jarman and dr shine joined the walkers too in the vain hope of sending an engine or even a hand car for us but all their representations to gen cobb and the r.r authorities were fruitless nothing could be done till morning and a rumor got out among us from somewhere that even then there would be nothing for it but to walk and get our baggage moved as best we might for the first time my spirits gave way and as metta was too ill to notice what i was doing i hid my face in my hands and took a good cry then the captain came over and did his best to cheer me up by talking about other things he showed me photographs of his sisters nice stylish looking girls as one would expect the sisters of such a man to be and i quite fell in love with one of them who had followed him to a yankee prison and died there of typhoid fever contracted while nursing him as soon as it became known that metta was sick we were overwhelmed with kindness from all the other passengers but there was not much that anybody could do and rest the chief thing she needed was out of the question at supper time the conductor brought in some hardtack that he had on board to feed the workmen and distributed it among us i was so hungry that i tried to eat it but soon gave up and my jawbones are sore yet from the effort but the provisions that we had shared with our companions on the journey proved to be bread cast on the waters that did not wait many days to be returned i had hardly taken my first bite of hardtack when judge baker invited metta and me to share a nice cold supper with him the bride offered us the only thing she had left some real coffee which the colonel had boiled at a fire kindled on the ground outside and two ladies strangers to us who had got aboard at gordon sent us each a paper package containing a dainty little lunch of cold chicken and buttered biscuit but metta was too ill to eat she had a high fever and we both spent a miserable sleepless night at last day began to break cold clear and frosty and with it came travelers who had walked out from macon bringing confirmation of the report that no arrangements would be made for carrying passengers and their baggage to the city this news made us desperate the men on board swore that the train should not move till some provision was made for getting us to our destination this made the gordon passengers furious they said there were several women among them who had walked out from the city two of them with babies in their arms and the train should go on time come what would our men said there were ladies in the car too we had paid our fare to macon and they intended to see that we got there each party had a show of right on its side but possession is nine points of the law and this advantage we determined not to forego the gordon passengers began to crowd in on us till we could hardly breathe and capt mackall in no gentle terms ordered them out high words passed swords and pistols were drawn on both sides and a general fight seemed about to take place mett and i were frightened out of our wits at the first alarm and threw our arms about each other i kept quiet till i saw the shooting about to begin and then my nerves all unstrung by what i had suffered during the night i tuned up and began to cry like a baby it was well i did for my tears brought the men to their senses judge baker and col scott interfered reminding them that ladies were present and then arms were laid aside and profuse apologies made for having frightened us both parties then turned their indignation against the railroad officials and somebody was making a bluster about pitching the conductor into the creek when he appeared on the scene and appeased all parties by announcing that a locomotive and car would be sent out to meet the passengers for macon on the other side of the creek and take us to the city in the meantime we were tantalized by hearing the whistles of the different trains with which we wished to connect as they rolled out of the dépot in macon it was eight o'clock before our transfer consisting of an engine and a single box car arrived at the other end of the trestle and as they had to be unloaded of their freight before we could get aboard it was nearly ten when we reached macon but as soon as they were heard approaching we were so glad to get out of the prison where we had spent such an uncomfortable night that we immediately put on our wraps and began to cross the tottering trestle on foot it was 80 feet high and half a mile long over a swamp through which flowed walnut creek now swollen to a torrent part of the flooring of the bridge was washed down stream and our only foothold was a narrow plank hardly wider than my two hands capt mackall charged himself with my parcels and mr belisle was left to look after the trunks strong headed men walked along the sleepers on either side to steady any one that might become dizzy just behind metta who followed the captain and me hobbled a wounded soldier on crutches and behind him came maj bonham borne on the back of a stout negro porter last of all came porters with the trunks and it is a miracle to me how they contrived to carry such heavy loads over that dizzy tottering height once across the bridge we disposed ourselves wherever we could find a firm spot a dry one was out of the question when metta drew off her veil and gloves i was terrified at the looks of her hands and face we were both afraid she had contracted some awful disease in that dirty car but the captain laughed and said he knew all about army diseases and thought it was nothing but measles when we got to macon dr shine further relieved my mind by assuring me it was a mild case and said she needed only a few days rest we reached the dépot just ten minutes after the south western train had gone out so we went to the lanier house and i at once sent mr belisle for brother troup only to learn that he had gone on the very train we had missed to spend christmas at his plantation it was delightful to get into clean comfortable quarters at the lanier house metta got into bed and went right off to sleep and i lay down for awhile but was so often disturbed by friendly messages and inquiries that i got up and dressed for dinner i put on my pretty flowered merino that had been freshened up with black silk ruchings that completely hid the worn places and the waist made over with elizabethan sleeves so that it looked almost like a new dress besides being very becoming as the big sleeves helped out my figure by their fullness i frizzed my hair and put on the head dress of black velvet ribbon and gold braid that cousin sallie farley gave me i think i must have looked nice because i heard several people inquiring who i was when i went into the dining room i had hardly put in the last pin when a servant came to announce that mr charles day mary's father had called he was the only person in the drawing room when i entered and made a very singular not to say striking appearance with his snow white hair framing features of such a peculiar dark complexion that he made me think of some antique piece of wood carving the impression was strengthened by a certain stiffness of manner that is generally to be noticed in all men of northern birth and education not long after harry day called he said that mary was in savannah cut off by sherman so that they could get no news of her he didn't even know whether mother's invitation had reached her gussie and mary lou lamar followed the days and i was kept so busy receiving callers and answering inquiries about mett that i didn't have time to find out how tired and sleepy i was till i went to bed judge vason happened to be at the hotel when we arrived and insisted that we should pack up and go with him to albany next day and stay at his house till we were both well rid of the measles for it stands to reason that i shall take it after nursing metta he said that it had just been through his family from a to z so there was no danger of our communicating it to anybody there then mrs edward johnston came and proposed taking us to her house and on dr shine's advice i decided to accept this invitation as it would hardly be prudent for metta to travel in her present condition and we could not get proper attention for her at the hotel i could not even get a chambermaid without going the whole length of the corridor to ring the bell and waiting there till somebody came to answer it the colonel and his party left on the one o'clock train that night for columbus where they expect to take the boat for apalachicola after taking leave of them i went to bed and if ever any mortal did hard sleeping i did that night next day mr johnston called in his carriage and brought us to his beautiful home on mulberry st where we are lodged like princesses in a bright sunny room that makes me think of old chaucer's lines that i have heard cousin liza quote so often this is the port of rest from troublous toile the world's sweet inne from paine and wearisome turmoile
feb 2 thursday we spent the evening at maj edwin bacon's rehearsing for tableaux and theatricals and i never enjoyed an evening more we had no end of fun and a splendid supper with ice cream and sherbet and cake made of real white sugar i like the programme too and my part in it though i made some of the others mad by my flat refusal to make myself ridiculous by taking the part of the peri in a scene from lalla rookh imagine poor little ugly me setting up for a pert wouldn't people laugh i must have parts with some acting i can't run on my looks the entertainment is to take place at sister's and all the neighborhood and a number of people from albany will be invited the stage will be erected in the wide back entry between sister's room and the dining room which will serve for dressing rooms after the rehearsal came a display of costumes and a busy devising of dresses which interested me very much i do love pretty clothes and it has been my fate to live in these hard war times when one can have so little feb 4 saturday we met in the schoolhouse at mt enon to rehearse our parts but everybody seemed out of sorts and i never spent a more disagreeable two hours mett wouldn't act the peri because she had had a quarrel with her penitent and miss lou bacon said she couldn't take the part of esther before ahasuerus unless she could wear white kid gloves because she had burnt one of her fingers pulling candy and a sore finger would spoil the looks of her hand think of esther touching the golden scepter with a pair of modern white kid gloves on it would be as bad as me for a peri mett and miss lou are our beauties and if they fail us the whole thing falls through feb 5 sunday went to church at mt enon and did my best to listen to dr hillyer but there were so many troops passing along the road that i could keep neither thoughts nor my eyes from wandering jim chiles came home to dinner with us he always has so much news to tell that he is as good as the county paper and much more reliable i have a letter from lily legriel asking me to make her a visit before i go home she is refugeeing in macon and i think i will stop a few days as i pass through feb 9 thursday we are in albany mett mrs meals and i on our way to americus where i am going to consult cousin bolling pope about my eyes they have been troubling me ever since i had measles we had hardly got our hats off when jim chiles came panting up the steps he had seen the carriage pass through town and must run round at once to see if a sudden notion had struck us to go home after tea came capt hobbs the welshes and a mr green of columbus to spend the evening mrs welsh gives a large party next thursday night to which we are invited and she also wants me to stay over and take part in some theatricals for the benefit of the hospitals but i have had enough of worrying with amateur theatricals for the present feb to friday we had to get up very early to catch the seven o'clock train to americus jim met us at the dépot though there were so many of our acquaintances on board that we had no special need of an escort mr george lawton sat by me all the way from smithville to americus and insisted on our paying his family a visit before leaving south west georgia i wish i could go for he lives near father's old tallassee plantation where i had such happy times in my childhood but if we were to accept all the invitations that come to us we would never get back home again we reached americus at ten and went straight to cousin bolling's hospital he was not there but dr howard his assistant told us he was in the village and would be at the office in a few minutes all along the streets as we were making our way from the dépot to the hospital we could recognize his patients going about with patches and shades and blue spectacles over their eyes and some of them had blue or green veils on we didn't care to wait at the hospital in all that crowd of men so we started out to visit the shops intending to return later and meet cousin bolling we had gone only a few steps when we saw him coming toward us his first words were the announcement that he was married i couldn't believe him at first and thought he was joking then he insisted that we should go home with him and see our new cousin we felt doubtful about displaying our patched up confederate traveling suits before a brand new bride from beyond the blockade with trunk loads of new things but curiosity got the better of us and so we agreed to go home with him he is occupying col maxwell's house while the family are on the plantation in lee county when we reached the house with cousin bolling mrs pope or cousin bessie as she says we must call her now made us feel easy by sending for us to come to her bedroom as there was no fire in the parlor and she would not make company of us she was a mrs ayres before her marriage to cousin bolling a young widow from memphis tenn and very prominent in society there she is quite handsome and having just come from beyond the lines her beautiful dresses were a revelation to us dowdy confederates and made me feel like a plucked peacock her hair was arranged in three rolls over the top of the head on each side of the part in the style called cats rats and mice on account of the different size of the rolls the top one being the largest it was very stylish i wish my hair was long enough to dress that way for i am getting very tired of frizzes they are so much trouble and always will come out in wet weather we were so much interested that we stayed at cousin bolling's too long and had to run nearly all the way back to the dépot in order to catch our train on the cars i met the very last man i would have expected to see in this part of the world my boston friend mr adams he said he was on his way to take charge of a presbyterian church in eufaula ala he had on a broadcloth coat and a stovepipe hat which are so unlike anything worn by our confederate men that i felt uncomfortably conspicuous while he was with me i am almost ashamed nowadays to be seen with any man not in uniform though mr adams being a northern man and a minister could not of course be expected to go into the army i believe he is sincere in his southern sympathies but his yankee manners and lingo sorter riles me as the darkies say in spite of reason and common sense he talked religion all the way to smithville and parted with some pretty sentiment about the sunbeam i had thrown across his path i don't enjoy that sort of talk from men i like dash and flash and fire in talk as in action we reached albany at four o'clock and after a little visit to mrs sims started home where we arrived soon after dark without any adventure except being nearly drowned in the ford at wright's creek feb 11 saturday making visits all day it takes a long time to return calls when people live so far apart and every mile or two we have to go out of our way to avoid high waters stokes walton's creek runs underground for several miles so that when the waters are high we leave the main road and cross where it disappears underground there is so much water now that the subterranean channel can't hold it all so it flows below and overflows above ground making a two storied stream it is very broad and shallow at that place and beautifully clear it would be a charming place for a boating excursion because the water is not deep enough to drown anybody if they should fall overboard but if the bottom should drop out of the road as sometimes happens in this limestone country where in the name of heaven would we go to sister and i spent the evening at mrs robert bacon's the camps the edwin bacons capt wynne and mrs westmoreland were there we enjoyed ourselves so much that we didn't break up till one o'clock sunday morning mrs westmoreland says she gave capt sailes a letter of introduction to me thinking i had gone back to washington he and john garnett one of our far off virginia cousins have been transferred there feb 12 sunday spring is already breaking in this heavenly climate and the weather has been lovely to day the yellow jessamine buds begin to show their golden tips forget me nots are peeping from under the wire grass and the old cherry tree by the dairy is full of green leaves spring is so beautiful i don't wonder the spring poet breaks loose then our piney woods don't enjoy a very poetical reputation but at this season they are the most beautiful place in the world to me i went over to the quarter after dinner to the praise house to hear the negroes sing but most of them had gone to walk on the river bank so i did not get a full choir at their praise meetings they go through with all sorts of motions in connection with their songs but they won't give way to their wildest gesticulations or engage in their sacred dances before white people for fear of being laughed at they didn't get out of their seats while i was there but whenever the sperrit of the song moved them very much would pat their feet and flap their arms and go through with a number of motions that reminded me of the game of old dame wiggins that we used to play when we were children they call these native airs little speritual songs in contradistinction to the hymns that the preachers read to them in church out of a book and seem to enjoy them a great deal more one of them has a quick lively melody which they sing to a string of words like these mary an marthy feed my lambs feed my lambs feed my lambs mary an marthy feed my lambs settin on de golden altar i weep i moan what mek i moan so slow i won'er ef a zion traveler have gone along befo mary an marthy feed my lambs etc paul de postle feed my lambs feed my lambs feed my lambs and so on through as many bible names as they could think of another of their sperrituals runs on this wise i meet my soul at de bar of god i heerd a mighty lumber hit was my sin fell down to hell jes like a clap er thunder mary she come runnin by tell how she weep en wonder mary washin up jesus feet de angel walkin up de golden street run home believer oh run home believer run home believer run home another one sung to a kind of chant begins this way king jesus he tell you fur to fetch im a hoss en a mule he tek up mary behine im king jesus he went marchin befo chorus christ was born on chris'mus day mary was in pain christ was born on chris'mus day king jesus was his name the chorus to another of their songs is i knowed it was a angel i knowed it by de groanin i mean to make a collection of these songs some day and keep them as a curiosity the words are mostly endless repetitions with a wild jumble of misfit scriptural allusions but the tunes are inspiring they are mostly a sort of weird chant that makes me feel all out of myself when i hear it way in the night too far off to catch the words i wish i was musician enough to write down the melodies they are worth preserving feb 13 monday letters from home our house is full of company as it always is only more so all the morgans are there and mary day and the gairdners from augusta besides a host of what one might call transients if father was keeping a hotel friends acquaintances and strangers whom the tide of war has stranded in little washington mrs gairdner's husband was an officer in the english army at waterloo and a schoolmate of lord byron and her sons are brave confederates which is better than anything else mary day had typhoid fever in augusta she is too weak to make the journey from mayfield to macon and all non combatants have been ordered to leave augusta so mother invited her to haywood oh that dear old home i know it is sweeter than ever now with all those delightful people gathered there one good thing the war has done among many evils it has brought us into contact with so many pleasant people we should never have known otherwise i know it must be charming to have all those nice army officers around and i do want to go back but it is so nice here too that we have decided to stay a little longer father says that this is the best place for us now that kilpatrick's raiders are out of the way i wish i could be in both places at once they write us that little washington has gotten to be the great thoroughfare of the confederacy now since sherman has cut the south carolina r.r and the only line of communication between virginia and this part of the country from which the army draws its supplies is through there and abbeville this was the old stage route before there were any railroads and our first rebel president traveled over it in returning from his southern tour nearly three quarters of a century ago when he spent a night with col alison in washington it was a different thing being a rebel in those days and now i wonder the yankees don't remember they were rebels once themselves mrs meals asked me to go with her in the afternoon to visit some of the cracker people in our neighborhood and try to collect their children into a sunday school which the dear pious little soul proposes to open at pine bluff after the manner of hannah more at one place where the parents were away from home the children ran away from us in a fright and hid behind their cabin i went after them and capturing one little boy soon made friends with him and got him to bring the others to me i was surprised to find the wife of our nearest cracker neighbor who lives just beyond the lime sink in a cabin that brother troup wouldn't put one of his negroes into a remarkably handsome woman in spite of the dirt and ignorance in which she lives her features are as regular and delicate as those of a grecian statue and her hair of a rich old mahogany color that i suppose an artist would call titian red it was so abundant that she could hardly keep it tucked up on her head she was dirty and unkempt and her clothing hardly met the requirements of decency but all that could not conceal her uncommon beauty i would give half i am worth for her flashing black eyes we found that her oldest child is thirteen years old and has never been inside a church though mt enon is only three miles away i can't understand what makes these people live so the father owns 600 acres of good pine land and if there was anything in him ought to make a good living for his family after supper we amused ourselves getting up valentines everybody in the neighborhood has agreed to send one to jim chiles so he will get a cartload of them i made up seven stanzas of absurd trash to capt hobbs every one ending with a rhyme on his name the last being oh how my heart bobs at the very name of richard hobbs feb 16 thursday we started for albany for mrs welsh's party soon after breakfast but were a good deal delayed on the way by having to wait for a train of forty government wagons to pass we found mrs julia butler at mrs sims's straight from washington with letters for us and plenty of news i feel anxious to get back now since washington is going to be such a center of interest if the yanks take augusta it will become the headquarters of the department mrs butler says a train of 300 wagons runs between there and abbeville and they are surveying a railroad route several regiments are stationed there and the town is alive with army officers and government officials how strange all this seems for dear quiet little washington it must be delightful there with all those nice army officers i am going back home as soon as i can decently change my mind i have been at the rear all during the war and now that i have a chance i want to go to the front i wish i could be here and there too at the same time we were fairly besieged with visitors till time to dress for the party miss pyncheon dined with us and gardiner montgomery is staying in the house and i can't tell how many other people dropped in it was all perfectly delightful capt hobbs and dr pyncheon offered themselves as escorts but we had already made engagements with albert bacon and jim chiles we gave miss pyncheon and dr sloane seats in our carriage and we six cliqued together a good deal during the evening and had a fine time of it i never did enjoy a party more and never had less to say about one i had not a single adventure during the entire evening metta was the belle par excellence but miss pyncheon and i were not very far behind and i think i was ahead of them all in my dress miss pyncheon wore a white puffed tarleton with pearls and white flowers the dress though beautiful was not becoming because the one fault of her fine aristocratic face is want of color a little rouge and sepia would improve her greatly if a nice girl could make up her mind to use them mett wore white suisse with festoon flounces over my old blue florence silk skirt the flounces like charity covering a multitude of faults she was a long way the prettiest one in the room though her hair is too short to be done up stylishly but my dress was a masterpiece sic though patched up like everybody else's out of old finery that would have been cast off years ago but for the blockade i wore a white barred organdy with a black lace flounce round the bottom that completely hid the rents made at dances in montgomery last winter and a wide black lace bow and ends in the back to match the flounce handsome lace will make almost anything look respectable and i thank my stars there was a good deal of it in the family before the yankees shut us off by their horrid blockade my waist was of light puffed blonde very fluffy made out of the skirt i wore at henry's wedding and trimmed round the neck and sleeves with ruchings edged with narrow black lace my hair was frizzed in front with a cluster of white hyacinths surmounting the top row of curls and a beautifully embroidered butterfly aunt sallie had made for me half hidden among them as if seeking its way to the flowers my train was very long but i pinned it up like a tunic over a billowy flounced muslin petticoat while dancing my toilet was very much admired and i had a great many compliments about it and everybody turned to look at it as i passed which put me in good spirits we danced eighteen sets and i was on the floor every time besides all the round dances and between times there were always three or four around talking to me mett says it counts a great deal more to have one very devoted at a time but that keeps the others away and i think it is much nicer to have a crowd around you all the time one man grows tiresome unless you expect to marry him and i am never going to marry anybody marriage is incompatible with the career i have marked out for myself but i want to have all the fun i can before i am too old among others i met my old acquaintance mr draper who was one of the attendants at henry's wedding he says i have changed a great deal and look just like mett did then i suppose i may take this as a double barreled compliment as metta is the beauty of the family and she was then only fifteen while i am now twenty four oh how time does fly and how fast we grow old but there is one comfort when a woman doesn't depend upon looks she lasts longer capt hobbs has got his valentine and everybody is laughing about it they were all so sure it came from me that dr conolly and the captain put their heads together and wrote a reply that they were going to send me but i threw them off the track so completely that they are now convinced that it came from merrill callaway even albert bacon is fooled and it is he that told me all capt hobbs and the others said about it and of their having suspected me i pretended a great deal of curiosity and asked what sort of poetry it was mr bacon then repeated some of my own ridiculous rhymes to me it is a capital thing he said shaking with laughter only a little hard on hobbs it is just like merrill said i but i am sorry the captain found out i didn't send it before mailing his reply i am going to tell them better in a few days and let them see how royally they have been fooled feb 17 friday we had expected to bring miss pyncheon out to pine bluff with us but mrs butler had the only vacant seat in the carriage i felt stupid and sleepy all day for it was after four o'clock in the morning when i got home from the party and went to bed i took a walk with the children after dinner to the lime sink back of the newground the sink is half full of water from an overflowed cypress pond just this side of mt enon the water runs in a clear stream down a little declivity something very uncommon in this flat country in finding its way to the sink and makes a lovely little waterfall there is a subterranean outlet from the sink for it never overflows except in times of unusually heavy rain it makes a diminutive lake which is full of small fish and the banks are bordered with willow oaks and tall shrubs aglow with yellow jessamine an old man was seated on the bank fishing as we approached making a very pretty picture feb 21 tuesday a letter from mecca joyner saying she is coming to make me ha visit and i must meet her in albany on wednesday just as i had finished reading it a buggy drove up with flora maxwell and capt rust from gopher hill flora has a great reputation for beauty but i think her even more fascinating and elegant than beautiful capt rust is an exile from delaware and a very nice old gentleman whom the maxwells think a great deal of he was banished for helping southern prisoners to escape across the lines he tells me that he sometimes had as many as fourteen rebels concealed in his house at one time albert bacon called after tea and told us all about the hobbs poetry and teased me a good deal at first by pretending that capt hobbs was very angry he says everybody is talking about it and asking for copies i had no idea of making such a stir by my little joke metta and i were invited to spend this week at stokes walton's but company at home prevented we are going to have a picnic at the henry bacons lake on thursday and the week after we expect to begin our journey home in good earnest sister is going to visit brother troup in macon at the same time and a large party from albany will go that far with us i have so much company and so much running about to do that i can't find time for anything else i have scribbled this off while waiting for breakfast feb 22 wednesday i went to albany and brought mecca joyner and jim chiles home with me i took dinner with mrs sims and met several friends whom i invited to our picnic sister had a large company to spend the evening and they stayed so late that i grew very sleepy i am all upset anyway for letters from home have come advising us to stay here for the present where there is plenty to eat and less danger from yankees now than almost anywhere else it must be perversity for when i thought i had to go home i wanted to stay here and now that father wants me to stay i am wild to go i have written him that he had better order me back home for then i would not care so much about going now that the yanks have passed by augusta and are making their way to columbia and charleston i hope they will give georgia a rest feb 23 thursday the picnic was stupid it must be that i am getting tired of seeing the same faces so often albert bacon and jim chiles came home with us and we enjoyed the evening capt rust is a dear old fellow and miss connor and maj camp added a little variety capt rust and mr bacon proposed a ride across country for the morning but there is not a riding habit in the family nor a piece of cloth big enough to make one i ruined mine in those fox hunts at chunnenuggee ridge last fall flora is a famous horsewoman and i know she must be a good rider for her every movement is grace itself she is one of those people that gains upon you on acquaintance she is so out of the commonplace there is something stately and a little cold about her that reminds me of a beautiful lily and yet there is a fascination about her that attracts everybody all the men that come near her go wild over her and i don't wonder if i could write a novel i would make her the heroine she seems to stand on a higher plane than we common mortals without intending or knowing it her simplicity and straightforwardness are her greatest charm feb 26 sunday flora and the captain have returned to gopher hill whither metta mecca and i are invited to follow on friday when sister goes up to macon jimmy callaway and his father have just come from washington with such glowing accounts of the excitement and gayety there that i am distracted to go back home if father don't write for us to come soon i think we will go to chunnenuggee by way of eufaula and the chattahoochee and if thomas's raiders catch us over in alabama father will wish he had let us come home after dinner i took mecca over to the praise house to hear the negroes sing i wish i was an artist so that i could draw a picture of the scene alfred one of the chief singers is a gigantic creature more like an ape than a man i have seen pictures of african savages in books of travel that were just like him his hands and feet are so huge that it looks as if their weight would crush the heads of the little piccaninnies when he pats them yet with all this strength they say he is a great coward and one of the most docile negroes on the plantation the women when they get excited with the singing shut their eyes and rock themselves back and forth clapping their hands and in the intervals when not moved by the sperrit occupy themselves hunting for lice in their children's heads old bob and jim are the preachers and very good old darkies they are in spite of their religion but the chief personages on the plantation are old granny mimey old uncle wally and uncle setley who are all superannuated and privileged characters i tell sister that uncle wally has nothing to do and uncle setley to help him the latter is very deaf and half crazy but harmless i am a special favorite of uncle wally's we have a chat every morning when he passes through the back yard on his way to the cowpen the other day he said to me you is de putties lady ever i seed you looks jes lack one er dese heer alablastered dolls we walked to the bluff on the river bank after leaving the quarter and sat there a long time talking spring is here in earnest the yellow jessamines are bursting into bloom and the air is fragrant with the wild crab apples
march 1 wednesday the weather has been so bad that we are thrown upon our own resources for amusement metta and mecca play cards and backgammon most of the time and albert bacon comes almost every day on some pretense or other one very dark night when he was here we told ghost stories till we frightened ourselves half to death and had to beg him to stay all night to keep the bogies off mett and i take long tramps in the afternoons through mist and mud but mec does not like to walk the lime sink is particularly attractive just now the little stream that feeds it is swollen by the rains and dashes along with a great noise it is so full of little fish that one can catch them in the hand and the swans go there to feed on them the whole wood is fragrant with yellow jessamines and carpeted with flowers another letter from home that makes me more eager than ever to return gen elzey and staff are at our house and the town is full of people that i want to see march 2 thursday we left pine bluff at eleven o'clock and reached the blue spring in time for lunch albert bacon and jimmy chiles were there to meet us hang a petticoat on a bean pole and carry it where you will jimmy will follow the river is so high that its muddy waters have backed up into the spring and destroyed its beauty but we enjoyed the glorious flowers that bloom around it and saw some brilliant birds of a kind that were new to me mr bacon said he would kill one and give me to trim my hat march 3 friday gopher hill up at daybreak and on the train ready to leave albany albert and jimmy were there of course besides a number of albany people who had come to see us off a great compliment at that heathenish hour we got off at wooten's station only twelve miles from albany flora and capt rust were there to meet us with conveyances for gopher hill it is worth the journey from pine bluff to gopher hill just to travel over the road between there and wooten's it runs nearly all the way through swamps alive with the beauty and fragrance of spring we passed through starkesville and crossed muckolee creek at the very spot where i had such an adventurous night in my childhood traveling in the old stage coach that used to run between macon and albany the swamps were overflowed then and we had to cross the creek in a canoe and cousin bolling held me in his lap to keep me from falling out on the other side of the creek towards gopher hill we came to an old indian clearing where are some magnificent willow oaks that i recognized distinctly though it is fourteen years since then gopher hill is seven miles from the station it is like most plantation houses in this part of the world where they are used only for camping a few weeks in winter or were before the war a big one storied log cabin or rather a combination of cabins spread out over a full half acre of ground and even then with hardly room enough to accommodate the army of guests the family gather about them when they go to the country on each side of the avenue leading to the house is a small lake and about two miles back in the plantation a large one on which flora has a row boat she has a beautiful pony named fleet that is the counterpart of our own dear little dixie col maxwell has a great many fine horses and all sorts of conveyances which are at the service of his guests he is one of the most aristocratic looking old gentlemen i ever saw in manners appearance and disposition he is strikingly like brother troup except that the colonel is very large and commanding while brother troup is small and dapper he is very handsome next to bishop elliot one of the finest specimens of southern manhood i ever saw it is one of the cases where blood will tell for he has the best of georgia in his veins or to go back further the best in old scotland itself though over sixty years old he has never been out of the state and is as full of whims and prejudices as the traditional old country squire that we read about in english novels his present wife flora's stepmother is much younger than he very gay and witty and escapes all worry by taking a humorous view of him and his crotchets he and flora idolize each other and she is the only person that can do anything with him and not always even she when he once gets his head fast set we had dinner at two o'clock and afterwards went to a country school about two miles away to hear the boys and girls declaim the schoolmaster made so many facetious remarks about the ladies that i asked flora if he was a widower he seemed too silly to be anything else but she says he has a wife living poor thing we met gen graves at the schoolhouse and he rode back with us we took to the woods and jumped our horses over every log we came to just to see what he would do march 4 saturday i had just finished writing some letters when gen graves and mr baldwin were announced and i went to the parlor the general is consumedly in love with flora and mr baldwin equally so with his bottle but is nice looking and when not too far gone quite agreeable it is amusing to see good old capt rust watching over him and trying to keep temptation out of his way he stole the bottle out of his bedroom the first chance he could find but not until the poor fellow had got more of it than was good for him the weather cleared up after dinner and we went to coney lake where the boat is flora and i on horseback the rest in buggies and carriages it is a beautiful place great avenues of cypress extend into the shallow waters near the shore where we could float about in shady canals and gather the curious wild plants that grow there huge water lilies with stems like ropes and leaves as big as palm leaf fans float about in shady canals and great lotus plants with their curious funnel shaped pods and umbrella like leaves line the shores and shallows the lake is so deep in the center that it has never been fathomed being connected probably with a lime sink or an underground stream but its waters are clear as crystal and where they are shallow enough to show the bottom all kinds of curious aquatic plants can be seen growing there in the wildest luxuriance i took my first row with mr baldwin and wished myself back on shore before we had made twenty strokes he was just far enough gone to be reckless and frightened me nearly out of my wits by rocking the boat till the gunwales dipped in the water and then tried to pacify me with maudlin talk about swimming ashore with me if it should capsize i picked up a paddle and tried to row the boat myself and then he got interested in teaching me and finally we came safe to land i went out again with capt rust and enjoyed the last trip more than any we were followed by an alligator and capt rust gathered for me some of the curious plants that were floating on the water it was late when we started back to the house and the ride was glorious flora and i amused ourselves by going through the woods and making our horses jump the highest logs we could find fleet was so full of spirit that i could hardly hold him in march 5 sunday one of the loveliest days i ever saw we went to a little methodist church in starkesville for the pleasure of the drive after dinner we walked to the bubbling spring and killed a big snake on the way the spring is down in a gully and is simply the mouth of a small underground stream that comes to the surface there it throws up a kind of black sand that rises on the water like smoke from the stack of a steam engine the water under ground makes strange sounds like voices wailing and groaning just below the spring is a little natural bridge the most romantic spot i have seen in the neighborhood the rocks that border the stream are covered with ferns and brilliant green mosses and liverworts palmettoes and bright flowering plants grow in the crevices and the whole place is shaded by magnolias willow oaks and myrtles bound together by gigantic smilax and jessamine vines at several places there are openings in the ground through which one can peep and see rapid water flowing under our feet this whole country is riddled with underground streams at palmyra not far from albany there is a mill turned by one the stream was discovered by a man digging a well to which an accident happened not uncommon in this country the bottom dropped out a calf that fell into the well and was supposed to be drowned turned up a few days after sound and safe his tracks led to an opening through which issued water covered with foam a great roaring was heard which further exploration showed to come from a fine subterranean waterfall march 6 monday after breakfast we all piled into a big plantation wagon and went to see prairie pond a great sheet of water covering over 200 acres it has formed there since col maxwell bought the gopher hill plantation he says that when he first came here there was not a patch of standing water as big as his hand on all the acres now covered by prairie pond and the great skeletons of dead forest trees still standing in the outer edges of the lake show that the encroachment of the water is still going on some years after he came to gopher hill he says a blue spring on the other side of the plantation that formed the outlet of an underground stream became choked up from some cause so the waters had no escape and prairie pond began to form and has been slowly increasing ever since near the lake we came to two remarkable lime sinks they are both very deep and as round as drinking cups one of them is covered with a green scum about an inch thick composed of scaly plants like lichens underneath this scum the water is clear as crystal the stones all around are full of fossil shells and we found some beautiful crystallized limestone that sparkled like diamonds we had to leave our wagon several hundred yards from the border of the pond and make our explorations on foot for want of a wagon road in returning we took the wrong direction and went a mile or two out of our way getting very wet feet and i tore my dress so that i looked like a ragamuffin into the bargain when at last we reached home the servants told us that mr and mrs warren with gen graves mr baldwin and clint spenser and joe godfrey from albany had come over to dinner and not finding anybody at home had set out in search of us we girls scurried to our rooms and had just made ourselves respectable when mr baldwin and mr spenser having tired of their wild goose chase came back to the house mecca and i got into the double buggy with them and started out to hunt up the rest of the party after dinner we went to coney lake again i went in the buggy with joe godfrey he and mr baldwin each invited me to take a row i didn't go with mr baldwin march 8 wednesday i went up to americus yesterday with flora and capt rust to see cousin bolling about my eyes expecting to return to gopher hill on the afternoon train but cousin bessie insisted that we should stay to dinner and her attempt to have it served early was so unsuccessful that capt rust and i got to the station just in time to see the train moving off without us flora had another engagement that caused her to decline mrs pope's invitation so she made the train but the captain and i had nothing for it but to spend the night in americus and kill the night as best we could i was repaid for the annoyance of getting left by the favorable report cousin bolling gave of my eyes he says it is nothing but the effects of measles that ails them and they are almost well i occupied flora's room that night cousin bessie lent me one of her fine embroidered linen nightgowns and i was so overpowered at having on a decent piece of underclothing after the coarse macon mills homespun i have been wearing for the last two years that i could hardly go to sleep i stood before the glass and looked at myself after i was undressed just to see how nice it was to have on a respectable undergarment once more i can stand patched up dresses and even take a pride in wearing confederate homespun where it is done open and above board but i can't help feeling vulgar and common in coarse underclothes cousin bessie has brought quantities of beautiful things from beyond the blockade that make us poor rebs look like ragamuffins beside her she has crossed the lines by special permit and will be obliged to return to memphis by the 2d of april when her pass will be out it seems funny for a white woman to have to get a pass to see her husband just like the negro men here do when their wives live on another plantation the times have brought about some strange upturnings cousin bolling is awfully blue about the war and it does begin to look as if our poor little confederacy was about on its last legs but i am so accustomed to all sorts of vicissitudes that i try not to let thoughts of the inevitable disturb me the time to be blue was five years ago before we went into it before breakfast this morning i went out to make the acquaintance of col maxwell's old mammy aunt lizzie she lives in a pretty little cottage on a corner of the lot and is more petted and spoiled than any of his children the day cousin bolling was first expected in americus with his bride flora went to town to put the house in order for them and asked aunt lizzie to cook dinner for the newly married pair what you talkin bout chile was the answer i wouldn't cook fur jesus christ to day let alone dr pope poor down trodden creature what a text for mrs stowe she has relented since then however and cousin bessie says often sends her presents of delicious rolls and light bread she took me into favor at once told me all about her rheumatiz and de spiration of her heart and kissed my hand fervently when i went away capt rust was so afraid of being left again that he would not wait for the omnibus but trotted me off on foot an hour ahead of time although it was raining we met mr wheatley and maj daniel on our way to the dépot and they told us that a dispatch had just been received stating that the yanks have landed at st mark's and are marching on tallahassee we first heard they were 4,000 strong but before we reached the dépot their numbers had swelled to 15,000 march 9 thursday mrs warren gave a dinner party to which all the people from gopher hill and a good many from albany were invited but very few attended on account of the weather it poured down rain all day and in the afternoon there was a furious storm but mrs maxwell is always in for a frolic so we left home at eleven between showers and got to the warrens just before the storm burst gen graves mr baldwin joe godfrey albert bacon and jim chiles were the only ones there besides mrs maxwell and her guests there is a fine lake in front of mr warren's house but the weather gave us no opportunity for rowing we dined at six and it was so dark when we rose from the table that we had to start for home at once mrs warren insisted on our staying all night but there was company invited to spend the evening at gopher hill so off we went in the rain we took a new road to avoid some bad mud holes in the old one and as a matter of course lost our way in the numerous blind roads that cross each other in every direction through the pine woods and which are all just alike except that they lead to different places or to no place at all the night was very dark and it rained furiously though the wind had lulled the glare of the lightning was blinding and terrific peals of thunder rang through the woods every few yards there were trees blown across the road and the negro mr warren had sent to guide us would have to grope about in the dark hunting for some way around them at last he confessed that he had lost his way and then i fell back in a corner of the phaeton and began to say my prayers as there was nothing else to do we concluded to follow the blind path we were in hoping it would lead somewhere it did lead us with a vengeance through ponds and bogs and dismal swamps where the frogs filled our ears with unearthly noises but all things have an end even piney woods byroads and at last we came out upon a broad smooth highway which the guide recognized as the one he was looking for our troubles were now over and in a short time we were back at gopher hill though it was very late we began to dance and enjoy ourselves in a fashion but everybody seemed to be more or less out of humor for before we went to bed i was made the confidante of four lovers quarrels march 10 friday a day of public fasting and prayer for our poor country but there was little of either done at gopher hill we had a late breakfast after our night's dissipation and soon after mr baldwin and mr bacon came over and played cards till dinner time after dinner the gentlemen proposed a row on the lake but mrs maxwell and i were the only ones that had fasted and we wouldn't indulge in a frolic and the others said they were afraid they might be drowned for their sins if they ventured on the water so we drove to the station instead we were too late to meet the train but heard plenty of news a tornado passed over the flat pond plantation yesterday destroying every house on it and killing fifteen negroes a schoolhouse was blown down and several children killed on one plantation all the poultry was drowned and two calves blown away and never came down again so much for marvels but the whole country between wooten's and gopher hill is really flooded one bridge that we crossed was entirely under water and seemed ready to give way and go down stream at any moment jimmy caught a gopher in the road on our way home and we saw rows of them sitting on logs in the swamps as if they were having a prayer meeting march 11 saturday played euchre and wrote letters all the morning capt rust gave me a pretty tucking comb which he had carved himself out of maple wood we had an early dinner and reached wooten's at least half an hour before the train was due at the dépot in albany albert bacon joe godfrey mr baldwin and gen graves were waiting for us we drove by the post office to get the mail and there half a dozen others surrounded the carriage and took the reins from uncle aby so that he could not drive away the people in the street laughed as they went by to see them buzzing round the carriage like bees and presently jim chiles found mary leila powers and mrs bell and brought them up to add to the hubbub poor old aby despaired of ever getting us out of town and when at last we started down the street we had not gone a hundred yards when i saw a young officer in a captain's uniform running after us and we came to another halt it turned out to be wallace brumby he says that he left washington two weeks ago and is water bound here on his way to florida where some of his men are straggling about if they haven't been swallowed up by the freshets that have disorganized everything he promised to stop at pine bluff on his way down and give us the news then uncle aby grew desperate and seeing another squad of officers coming up to join capt brumby whipped up his horses and drove off without further ceremony he was right to hurry for the roads are so flooded that we had to travel 20 miles to get home everything is under water in some places the front wheels were entirely submerged and we had to stand on the seats to keep our feet dry it was nine o'clock before we reached home and mrs butler and mrs meals had become so uneasy that they were about to send a man on horseback to see what had become of us i found letters from home waiting for us with permission to go to chunnennuggee or anywhere else we want to communication between here and washington is so interrupted that i don't suppose they have heard yet of the reported raid into florida and all our writing back and forth is at cross purposes the latest news is that the yankees have whipped our forces at tallahassee but the waters are so high and communication so uncertain that one never knows what to believe at any rate i shall not run till i hear that the enemy are at thomasville march 13 monday mett mecca and i took a long drive to look at some new muslin dress goods that we heard a countryman down towards camilla had for sale they were very cheap only twenty dollars a yard mett and i each bought a dress and would have got more if mrs settles the man's wife would have sold them how they came to let these two go so cheap i can't imagine i felt as if i were cheating the woman when i paid her 500 dollars in confederate money for 20 yards of fairly good lawn we stopped at gum pond on the way back and paid a visit albert bacon gave me a beautiful red bird that he shot for me to trim my hat with march 16 thursday rain rain rain nothing but rain the river is out of its banks again and all that part of the plantation overflowed a chain of ponds and lime sinks shuts us in behind a great slough of backwater from the river cuts us off from the negro quarter wright's creek is impassable on the north and the phinizy pond on the east we are completely water bound nobody can come to us and we can go nowhere the carriage house was blown down in the storm on tuesday night and the carriage will have to be repaired before we can use it again we have not even the mail to relieve the monotony of life sometimes the hack does not pass gum pond for four days at a time march 20 monday the rain has stopped at last and the waters are beginning to subside but the roads are terrible we have had a mail at last too and a long letter from home giving us carte blanche as to future movements as dear old father expressed it go where you please when you please do what you please and call on mr farley or mr butler for all the money you need that is the way i like to be treated i think now we will go to chunnennuggee by way of eufaula and the chattahoochee the river trip would be pleasant and jenny and julia toombs are with their aunt in eufaula who has invited us to meet them there however our movements are so uncertain that i don't like to make engagements we will stop a few days in cuthbert with the joyners anyway march 21 tuesday albany pouring down rain again but the carriage had to go to albany anyway to meet sister and mecca was hurried home by news of the death of her aunt so i rode in to the station with her the roads are horrible covered with water most of the way and the mischief with these piney woods ponds is that you never know what minute the bottom is going to drop out and let you down with it to the lord only knows where the carriage was so much out of order that i expected the hind wheels to fly off at every jolt i sent it to the shop to be repaired as soon as mecca and i were safely deposited at mrs sims's the train was not due till three and our good little friend occupied the time in trying to convert mecca mec didn't abjure on the spot but held out a flag of truce by remarking that her father had been baptized and brought up in the episcopal church his apostasy only made matters worse in mrs sims's eyes she could not understand how anybody reared in the true faith could fall away and become a dissenter oh he was surfeited with the prayer book when a boy he says mecca explained laughing like he was with hominy and milk grandma used to make him eat it for breakfast every morning whether he wanted it or not and in the same way she made him go to the episcopal church every sunday whether he wanted to or not and so as soon as he was old enough to have his own way he swore off from both why exclaimed the zealous proselytes i don't see why he should have let his dislike of hominy and milk drive him out of the church mecca tried to explain mrs sims shook her head oh i know she said but don't you think he did wrong to let such a thing as that cause him to leave the church i don't see what hominy and milk could have to do with anybody's religion mec laughed and gave it up the rain stopped about dinner time and it was beautifully clear when i drove to the dépot for sister she was very tired and went directly to mrs sims's but mecca and i walked down broad street to the post office where we were joined by mr godfrey and dr vason they and a number of others called in the evening march 22 wednesday up very early and drove to the dépot with mecca mr godfrey was there and proposed that we should go as far as smithville with her and let him drive me out home in the afternoon but the roads are so bad and the weather so uncertain that i thought i had better go back with sister the journey was the worst we have made yet we bogged at one place and had to wade through the mud while aby helped the mules to pull the carriage over at wright's creek we found a crowd of soldiers and countrymen on the bank and they told us the creek was too high to cross some of them were exchanged prisoners impatient to get home and they had determined to swim over they stood on the bank with bare legs ready to strip off and plunge in the moment our backs were turned i couldn't help being amused at the nonchalance with which one burly fellow pulled off his stockings and commenced playing with his toes while talking to us another wishing to call sister's attention to the water mark grabbed her by the arm and led her down the bank saying see this here stick here where the water has already begun to fall an hit'll fall a heap rapider the next hour or two they meant no harm these are unceremonious times when social distinctions are forgotten and the raggedest rebel that tramps the road in his country's service is entitled to more honor than a king we stood on the bank a long time talking with the poor fellows and listening to their adventures there was one old man standing on the shore gazing across as wistfully as moses might have looked towards the promised land he could not swim but his home was over there and he had made up his mind to plunge in and try to cross at any risk the soldiers saluted him with a few rough jokes and then showed their real metal by mounting him on the back of the strongest of them who waded in with his burden while two others swam along on each side to give help in case of accident sister and i thought at first of getting gen dahlgren to send us across in his pleasure boat but soon gave up the idea and concluded to stay at the mallarys till the creek became fordable for we knew it would fall as rapidly as it had risen we bid our soldier friends good by and drove away to the mallarys where we spent a pleasant day and night gen and mrs dahlgren called after dinner and said that we ought to have stopped with them mrs dahlgren is a beautiful woman and only twenty two years old while her husband is over sixty he is a pompous old fellow and entertained us by telling how his influence made gen joseph e johnston commander in chief of the army of tennessee how hood lost atlanta by not following his dahlgren's advice how he was the real inventor of the dahlgren gun which is generally attributed to his brother the yankee admiral and so on march 23 thursday we left the mallarys soon after breakfast and were successful in crossing the creek it seems hard to believe that this stream which is giving so much trouble now will be as dry as a baked brick next summer the road on the other side was fairly good and we got home long before dinner time no letters waiting for me but a package from mr herrin of chunnennuggee containing a beautiful fox tail in memory of our hunts together on the ridge last winter march 27 monday went to call on the callaways mallarys and dahlgrens the general and his wife were just starting out to make calls when we drove up so we went along together the roads are so perfectly abominable that it is no pleasure to go anywhere at one place the water was half a foot deep in the bottom of the carriage and we had to ride with our feet cocked up on the seats to keep them dry some of the ponds were so deep as almost to swim the mules and others were boggy we stopped at the post office on our way home and found a letter from mec urging us to come over to cuthbert right away march 28 tuesday misses caro and lou bacon spent the day with us but i could not enjoy their visit for thinking of the poor boy anderson who has been sent to jail he implored me to beg missis to forgive him and i couldn't help taking his part though i know he deserved punishment he refused to obey the overseer and ran away four times a soldier caught him and brought him in this morning with his hands tied behind him such sights sicken me and i couldn't help crying when i saw the poor wretch though i know discipline is necessary especially in these turbulent times and sister is sending him to jail more as an example to the others than to hurt him she has sent strict orders to the sheriff not to be too severe with him but there is no telling what brutal men who never had any negroes of their own will do they don't know how to feel for the poor creatures march 31 friday mrs callaway gave a large dining and i wore a pretty new style of head dress cousin bessie told me how to make that was very becoming it is a small square about as big as my two hands made of a piece of black and white lace that ran the blockade and nobody else has anything like it one point comes over the forehead just where the hair is parted and the opposite one rests on top of the chignon behind with a bow and ends of white illusion it has the effect of a queen of scots cap and is very stylish the dining was rather pleasant kate callaway's father mr furlow was there with his youngest daughter nellie who is lovely as we were coming home we passed by a place where the woods were on fire and were nearly suffocated by the smoke it was so dense that we could not see across the road on coming round to the windward of the conflagration it was grand the smoke and cinders were blown away from us but we felt the heat of the flames and heard their roaring in the distance the volumes of red hot smoke that went up were of every hue according to the materials burning and the light reflected on them some were lurid yellow orange red some a beautiful violet others lilac pink purple or gray while the very fat lightwood sent up columns of jet black the figures of the negroes as they flitted about piling up brush heaps and watching the fire on the outskirts of the clearing reminded me of old fashioned pictures of the lower regions
april 1 saturday there was fooling and counter fooling between pine bluff and gum pond all day jim chiles and albert bacon began it by sending us a beautiful bouquet over which they had sprinkled snuff we returned the box that had held the flowers filled with dead rats dressed up in capes and mob caps like little old women then albert tried to frighten us by sending a panicky note saying a dispatch had just been received from thomasville that the yankees were devastating the country round there and heading for andersonville we pretended to believe it and sister wrote back as if in great alarm inquiring further particulars albert got his father to answer with a made up story that he and wallace had both gone to help fight the raiders at thomasville they must have thought us fools indeed to believe that the enemy could come all the way from tallahassee or savannah to thomasville without our hearing a word of it till they got there but we pretended to swallow it all and got sister to write back that metta and i were packing our trunks and would leave for albany immediately so as to take the first train for macon and to give color to the story she sent word for tommy who was spending the day with loring bacon to come home and tell his aunties good by they were caught with their own bait and albert and jimmy fearing they had carried the joke too far came galloping over at full speed to prevent our setting out we saw them coming across the field and mett and i hid ourselves while sister met them with a doleful countenance pretending that we had already gone and that she was frightened out of her wits she had rubbed her eyes to make them look as if she had been crying and the children and servants too had been instructed to pretend to be in a great flurry when the jokers confessed their trick she pretended to be so hurt and angry that they were in dismay thinking they had really driven us off though all the while we were locked in our own room peeping through the cracks listening to it all and ready to burst with laughter they had mounted their horses and declared that they would go after us and fetch us back if they had to ride all the way to albany when old uncle setley spoiled our whole plot by laughing and yawping so that he excited their suspicion they got down from their horses and began to look for wheel tracks on the ground and at last jim who missed his calling in not being a detective went and peeped into the carriage house and saw the carriage standing there in its place this convinced them that we had not gone to albany but where were we then began the most exciting game of hide and seek i ever played such a jumping in and out of windows crawling under beds and sliding into corners was never done before the children and servants all but old fool setley acted their parts well but jimmy was not to be foiled they bid sister good by several times and rode away as if they were going home then suddenly returned in the hope of taking us by surprise at last after dark we thought they were off for good and went in to supper taking the precaution however to bar the front door and draw the dining room curtains but we had had hardly begun to eat when jimmy burst into the room exclaiming howdy do miss fanny you made a short trip to albany we all jumped up from the table and began to bombard him with hot biscuits and muffins and whatever else we could lay hands on then mr bacon came in a truce was declared and we sat down and ate supper or what was left of it together after supper we made uncle aby hitch up the carriage and drive us over to gum pond to surprise the family there i dressed myself up like an old cracker woman and went in and asked for a night's lodging maj bacon thought i was leila trying to play a trick on him so he dragged me very unceremoniously into the middle of the room under the lamp and pulled my bonnet off it was funny to see his embarrassment when he saw his mistake he is so awfully punctilious he said he was in the act of writing a note to send after us to albany when i came in they were all so delighted at finding they had not frightened us out of the country that we had a grand jubilee together we counted up before returning home and found that forty four miles had been ridden back and forth during the day on account of this silly april fooling i don't think i ever enjoyed a day more in my life it began happily too with anderson's return from jail early in the morning and peace making with his missis i expect we were all as glad of the poor darkey's release as he was himself mett says she wouldn't care much if they could all be set free but what on earth could we do with them even if we wanted to free them ourselves and to have a gang of meddlesome yankees come down here and take them away from us by force i would never submit to that not even if slavery were as bad as they pretend i think the best thing to do if the confederacy were to gain its independence would be to make a law confiscating the negroes of any man who was cruel to them and allowing them to choose their own master of course they would choose the good men and this would make it to everybody's interest to treat them properly april 2 sunday i went to church at mt enon after service we stopped to tell everybody good by and i could hardly help crying for we are to leave sure enough on tuesday and there is no telling what may happen before we come back the yankees may have put an end to our glorious old plantation life forever i went to the quarter after dinner and told the negroes good by poor things i may never see any of them again and even if i do everything will be different we all went to bed crying sister the children and servants farewells are serious things in these times when one never knows where or under what circumstances friends will meet again i wish there was some way of getting to one place without leaving another where you want to be at the same time some fourth dimension possibility by which we might double our personality april 3 monday albany ga all of us very miserable at the thought of parting mrs meals goes with us as far as wooten's on her way to gopher hill so sister and the children are left alone brother troup has been ordered to gen wofford's command in north georgia and this separation adds to her feeling of loneliness but she and the children will soon join us in washington so it won't matter so much the ride to albany was very unpleasant the sun scorching hot the glare of the sand blinding and mrs meals with a headache mr george hull writes that the georgia r.r will be open for travel by the last of this month and so our visits to cuthbert and macon will just fill in the interval for mett and me we can then go home by way of atlanta it is something to think we will be able to go all the way by rail and won't have to undergo that troublesome wagon ride again across the country april 4 cuthbert ga tuesday up early and at the dépot jim chiles accompanied us as far as smithville we had to wait five hours there for the train to cuthbert the hotel was so uninviting that we stayed in the car putting down the blinds and making ourselves as comfortable as we could capt warwick who is stationed there was very kind and attentive he paid us a call in our impromptu parlor and made some of his hands bring in buckets of water and sprinkle the floor to cool it off a little just before the train arrived on which we were to leave there came one with 1,100 yankee prisoners on their way from anderson en route for florida to be exchanged the guard fired a salute as they passed and some of the prisoners had the impudence to kiss their hands at us but what better could be expected of the foreign riff raff that make up the bulk of the yankee army if they had not been prisoners i would have felt like they ought to have a lesson in manners for insulting us but as it was i couldn't find it in my heart to be angry they were half naked and such a poor miserable starved looking set of wretches that we couldn't help feeling sorry for them in spite of their wicked war against our country and threw what was left of our lunch at them as their train rattled by thinking it would feed two or three of them at least but our aim was bad and it fell short so the poor creatures didn't get it and if any of them noticed i expect they thought we were only d d rebel women throwing our waste in their faces to insult them i am glad they are going to be exchanged anyway and leave a climate that seems to be so unfriendly to them though i think it is the garden spot of the world if i had my choice of all the climates i know anything about to live in i would choose the region between macon and thomasville the railroad from smithville to cuthbert runs into the oaky woods beyond smithville which are more broken and undulating than the pine flats and the swamps are larger and more beautiful on account of the greater variety of vegetation they are a huge mosaic at this season of wild azaleas atamasco lilies yellow jessamine and a hundred other brilliant wild flowers my taste may be very perverted but to my mind there is no natural scenery in the world so beautiful as a big southern swamp in springtime it has its beauty in winter too with the somber cypress the stately magnolias the silvery bays and the jungle of shrubs and vines gay with the red berries of holly and winter smilax the railroad from smithville to cuthbert is lined on both sides with saw mills getting out lumber for the government and they are destroying the beauty of the country the joyner girls and capt greenlaw were at the dépot to meet us mr joyner has bought an old hotel here for his family to refugee in and it really makes a very pleasant residence though not to compare with their pretty home in atlanta that the yankees destroyed cousin bolling's hospital has been moved here from americus and he and his little stepson brown ayres are boarding with the joyners dr robertson of virginia and capt graybill of macon are also members of the household in these days when everybody is living from hand to mouth and half the world is refugeeing most people who are fortunate enough to possess homes have very heterogeneous households the village seems to be very gay we found an invitation awaiting us for to morrow night and the gentlemen in the house proposed a theater party for this evening to see the amateurs but it is lent and i am trying to do better in the way of refraining from worldly amusements and mortifying the flesh than i did in montgomery last spring so we spent the evening at home april 5 wednesday just before daylight we were awakened by a lovely serenade and i gave myself a sore throat trotting over the house bare footed hunting for flowers to throw to the serenaders mett and mary had all that were in the house in their room and would not give the rest of us any their finest bouquet lodged in the boughs of a spreading willow oak near the window and then we had the laugh on them the girls were busy all day getting ready for miss long's wedding i might take more credit to myself for keeping lent if i had anything to wear but my one new dress isn't made up yet and everything else i have is too frazzled out to wear dr robertson and capt graybill both pretending to be good episcopalians urged me to go but that unfinished dress was a powerful support to my conscience i fixed metta up beautifully though and she was very much admired her hair that she lost last fall from typhoid fever has grown out curly and her head is frizzled beautifully all over without the bother of irons and curl papers metta says she never saw more elegant dressing than at miss long's wedding which is a great credit to the taste and ingenuity of our southern girls in patching up pretty things out of all sorts of odds and ends capt tennille an acquaintance of garnett's dined here and five of cousin bolling's patients called in the afternoon one of them capt guy had had a curious experience with a minié ball that knocked out one tooth and passed out at the back of his neck without killing him i laughed and told him he was certainly born to be hanged another poor fellow with a dreadfully ugly face had six battle scars to make him interesting a report has come that the yankees have taken selma and a raid is advancing towards eufaula so that puts a stop to our chunnennuggee trip i can't say that i am disappointed for i don't want to turn my face from home any more but mett was anxious to make the trip and i thought it would be mean not to go with her april 6 thursday capt greenlaw brought his flute and spent the morning he is red headed and ugly but very musical and such jolly good company that one can't help liking him i don't know when i have met a person that seemed so genial and altogether lovable in a brotherly sort of way i took a long walk through the village with capt greenlaw after dinner and was charmed with the lovely gardens and beautiful shade trees on coming home i heard of the fall of richmond everybody feels very blue but not disposed to give up as long as we have lee poor dr robertson has been nearly distracted since he heard the news his wife and five little children are on a farm near petersburg and he don't know what is to become of them april 7 friday capt greenlaw spent the day here and brought me the biggest bouquet of the biggest red roses i ever saw i couldn't help laughing when he threw it into my lap he calls me cousin because he says we both have such red heads that we ought to be kin there is something in his easy good natured way of laughing and joking about everything that reminds me a good deal of fred and he has the sweetest way in the world of carrying flowers about with him and slipping them into your work basket or throwing them into your lap or laying them on your handkerchief no matter where but i can always tell when he has been about by finding a full blown rose or a sprig of wild honeysuckle or a bunch of swamp lilies or some other big bright flower lying around among my things it rained most of the day but was not too wet for many callers and another long walk in the afternoon through this pretty little town the two female colleges have been turned into hospitals one of which is under cousin bolling's charge the news this evening is that montgomery has gone and the new capital of the confederacy will be either macon or athens georgia the war is closing in upon us from all sides i am afraid there are rougher times ahead than we have ever known yet i wish i was safe at home since brother troup has been ordered from macon our chance of getting a government wagon is gone and the railroad won't be finished through to atlanta for a week or ten days yet if ever i do get back home again i will stay there till the war is over april 8 saturday cousin bolling has returned from his visit to americus mary lizzie mett and i went to the dépot to meet him and hear the news then took a walk through lovers lane a beautiful shady road that runs through woods so thick as to make solid walls of green on either side it is intersected with other roads as white and shady as itself with all sorts of wild flowers blooming on the ground and climbing over the trees this is indeed one of the loveliest villages i ever was in but it has one most unromantic drawback it is awfully infested with fleas they are like an egyptian plague and keep you wriggling and squirming in a perpetual struggle against the vulgar impulse to scratch everybody is talking about the gloomy aspect of affairs capt greenlaw spent the morning as usual and the more i see of him the better i like him for his bright cheery disposition among those who called in the evening was a mr renaud of new orleans whom i liked very much he has that charming creole accent which would make it a pleasure to listen to him even if he were not so nice himself april 9 sunday i went to worship with a little band of episcopalians mostly refugees who meet every sunday in a schoolhouse it is a rough place with very uncomfortable benches but beautifully situated in a grove just at the entrance to lovers lane the services were conducted by old mr george who used to come out to the tallassee plantation as far back as i can remember and hold mission services for father's and mr nightingale's negroes sometimes in uncle jacob's cabin sometimes in the little log chapel on mr nightingale's silver lake place he teaches in the little schoolhouse all the week to support his family a full baker's dozen and holds church services on sundays for the refugees and soldiers of the faith that have stranded here he has spent his life in mission work laying the foundation of churches for other men to build on there is something very touching in the unrewarded labor of this good man grown gray in the service of his god the churches he builds up as soon as they begin to prosper ask the bishop for another pastor he wore no surplice and his threadbare silk gown was i verily believe the same that he used to wear in the old plantation chapel it was pathetic to see him his congregation still more so it consisted mainly of poor wounded soldiers from the hospitals especially in the afternoon when there were no services in the other churches they came some limping on crutches some with scarred and mangled faces some with empty sleeves nearly all with poor emaciated bodies telling their mute tale of sickness and suffering weariness and heartache i saw one poor lame fellow leading a blind one who held on to his crutch another had a blind comrade hanging upon one arm while an empty sleeve dangled where the other ought to be i have seen men since i came here with both eyes shot out men with both arms off and one poor fellow with both arms and a leg gone what can our country ever do to repay such sacrifice and yet it is astonishing to see how cheerful these brave fellows are especially cousin bolling's patients who laughingly dub themselves the blind brigade i went to the baptist church with the joyner girls at night metta and i were more amused than edified during the sermon by hearing ourselves discussed in whispers by some people directly behind us two of them got into a dispute as to which was the best looking but we could not hear how they decided it one of them suggested that we were twins and this gave me a good laugh on mett who is so much younger and better looking than i that the comparison was not at all flattering to her april 10 monday the day was largely taken up with callers when there is nothing else to do we amuse ourselves by sitting at the windows and looking into the streets mr joyner's house is between the post office and the quarters of the provost guard and just beyond the latter is a schoolhouse so we are never at a loss for something to amuse us the fashionable promenade of the village is up and down the street that runs in front of the house but i like better to walk in the woods which are very beautiful around here the tableaux club met at mrs joyner's in the evening metta and i will not be in cuthbert long enough to take part in the entertainment but were admitted to the rehearsal after the rehearsal some one suggested that we should go out serenading there were several good voices in the party and after calling at one or two private houses somebody said it would be a good idea to go and cheer up the soldiers in the hood hospital which was but a block or two away with some war songs the poor fellows were so delighted when they heard us that all who were able dressed themselves and came out on the terraces while others crowded to the windows and balconies they sent a shower of roses down on us and threw with them slips of paper with the names of the songs they wished to hear we gave them first cheer boys cheer we march away to battle which pleased them so much that they called for it a second time then some one struck up vive l'amour and mett gave an impromptu couplet here's to the boys in confederate gray vive la compagnie who never their country nor sweethearts betray vive etc while the soldiers were clapping and shouting the chorus two good lines popped into my head and when the noise had subsided a little i sang here's a toast to the boys who go limping on crutches vive la compagnie they have saved our land from the enemies clutches vive etc i waved my hand at a group of brave fellows leaning on crutches as i finished and a regular rebel yell went up from the hospital grounds flowers were rained down from the windows and i never was so delighted in my life to think that my little knack of stringing rhymes together had served some good purpose for once the soldiers clapped and shouted and rattled their crutches together and one big fellow standing near me threw up his battered old war hat and cried out bully for you give us some more and then i added here's death to the men who wear federal blue they are cowardly cruel perfidious untrue etc but after all it looks as if the wretches are going to bring death or slavery that is worse than death to us we may sing and try to put on a brave face but alas who can tell what the end of it all is to be april 1 tuesday i slept all the morning and was only wakened in the afternoon by mary joyner pulling at my feet and telling me to get up for dinner i like mary her manner is abrupt but she is generosity itself her devotion to the sick and wounded soldiers is beautiful often she will go without her dinner and always denies herself any special delicacy that happens to be on the table in order to take it to one of the hospitals almost every mail brings her grateful letters from the soldiers she has nursed or from the wives and sweethearts of those who will never need her services again i love to hear her tell about her experiences in the atlanta hospitals during the siege some of them are very funny but more of them are sad she was called the hospital angel in atlanta and well deserved the name the cuthbert thespian corps gave richelieu at the theater this evening for the benefit of the hospitals dr robertson acted the part of de mauprat and i dressed him for the occasion in the velvet cloak i bought from mrs sims and sleeves of crimson silk that had been the trousers of a turkish costume that sister wore at a fancy ball in columbus before the war i didn't go to see the play because i am keeping lent april 12 wednesday breakfast so late that visitors began to call before we had finished in the evening mr renaud and mr jeffers called mr jeffers is a wonderful mimic and sings a comic song so well that i told him i wondered how he ever escaped being a vagabond dr robertson had got leave to start for virginia in the morning and was having a farewell party of gentlemen in his room whom he seemed to be entertaining chiefly on tobacco and straws after a while they joined us in the parlor and mr jeffers introduced each one as he came in with a happy little rhyming couplet on his name or occupation altogether it was one of the brightest wittiest things i ever heard though i am sorry to say that some of the company gave evidence of having indulged too freely in straws with the usual seasonings dr boyd says that my little rhyme about the boys on crutches did the sick soldiers more good than all his medicines some poor fellows who had hardly noticed anything for a week he says laughed and clapped their hands like happy children as they lay on their beds and listened he says they have been talking about it ever since april 13 thursday slept away the morning as usual and spent the afternoon returning calls as that seems to be the fashionable time for visiting in cuthbert the tableaux club met at dr jackson's in the evening and after rehearsal we went to serenade the soldiers at the hill hospital as it would seem like slighting them to pass them by after serenading the others but they knew we were coming and so things didn't go off with the warmth and naturalness of our other visit they had prepared an entertainment for us and brought us some lemonade made with brown sugar and citric acid it was dreadful stuff but the dear fellows were giving us the best they had and i am afraid depriving themselves of supplies they needed for their own use while we were drinking somebody led off with a verse of the confederate toast and then looked at me and i added one that i felt half ashamed of because i had made it up beforehand and felt like an impostor but couldn't help it when i knew beforehand what was coming here's to the southern rebel drink it down here's to the southern rebel drink it down here's to the southern rebel may his enemies go to the i came to a sudden stop at the last word and the soldiers with a laugh and a yell took up the chorus and carried it through then we amused ourselves for some time answering each other with couplets good bad and indifferent mostly indifferent my parting one was hurrah for the soldiers who stay on the hill they have fought they have suffered they are full of pluck still april 15 saturday a new rumor that the yankees are at glenville advancing on eufaula but those best qualified to judge seem to think this move only a feint and that their real destination is columbus we seem to have been followed all winter by storms and floods and yankee panics we are not much disturbed by this one however as we expect to leave for macon on monday anyway capt greenlaw and mr renaud called in the afternoon but i was frizzing my hair and the other girls were asleep so none of us went downstairs to see them capt greenlaw came again in the evening but he was either sick or in love for he didn't laugh and tease as usual and kept asking for sentimental songs april 16 easter sunday the brightest loveliest day i ever beheld and our little schoolhouse of a chapel was well filled considering how few episcopalians are here twelve females and not a single male received the communion capt greenlaw went with me to the afternoon service while the other girls were taking their nap and we had a pleasant stroll afterwards through the woods on the way home we met cousin bolling's servant jordan who told me that jenny and julia toombs were at the hotel with their father and had sent for mett and me to come and see them they had passed through cuthbert on the morning train from eufaula but they had not gone fifteen miles beyond it when the boiler to their engine burst and they had to come back on the afternoon train and spend the night here we went immediately to the hotel and had a grand jubilee together april 17 monday macon ga up early to be ready for the train at seven the toombses met us at the dépot where capt greenlaw mr renaud and a number of others came to see us off when the train arrived from eufaula it was already crowded with refugees besides 300 volunteers from the exempts going to help fight the yankees at columbus all sorts of wild rumors were flying among them one that fighting had already begun at columbus and that a raid had been sent out towards eufaula excitement on the train was intense at ward's station a dreary looking little place we picked up the train wrecked yesterday with many of the passengers still on board they had spent the night there in the cars having nowhere else to go beyond ward's the failure of this train to appear had given color to all sorts of wild rumors about the advance of the yankees into south west georgia the excitement was intense all along the route at every little station crowds were gathered to hear the news and at many places we found a report had gone out that both our train and yesterday's had been captured the excitement increased as we approached fort valley where the muscogee road from columbus joins the south western and many of the passengers predicted that we should be captured there at the next station below fort valley our fears regarding the fate of columbus were confirmed by a soldier on the platform who shouted out as the train slowed down columbus gone up the spout nobody was surprised and all were eager to hear particulars i was glad to learn that our poor little handful of confederates had made a brave fight before surrendering the city was not given up till nine last night when the yanks slipped over the railroad bridge and got in before our men who were defending the other bridge knew anything about it we had not enough to watch both bridges and it seemed more likely the attack would be made by the dirt road then everybody blundered around in the dark fighting pretty much at random if a man met some one he did not know he asked whether he was a yank or a reb and if the answer did not suit his views he fired at last everybody became afraid to tell who or what they were it was thought that our forces had retired towards opelika when we reached fort valley the excitement was at fever heat train upon train of cars was there all the rolling stock of the muscogee road having been run out of columbus to keep it from being captured and the cars were filled with refugees and their goods it was pitiful to see them especially the poor little children driven from their homes by the frozen hearted northern vandals but they were all brave and cheerful laughing good naturedly instead of grumbling over their hardships people have gotten so used to these sort of things that they have learned to bear them with philosophy soldiers who had made their escape after the fight without surrendering were camped about everywhere looking tired and hungry and more disheartened than the women and children poor fellows they have seen the terrors of war nearer at hand than we as our train drew up at the dépot i caught sight of fred in the crowd he had been in the fight at columbus and i concluded was now on his way to cuthbert to find metta and me i called to let him know that we were on board but he did not hear me and before i could make my way to the opposite window the train moved on a few hundred yards and he was lost in the crowd i was greatly disturbed for it was said that the train we were on was the last that would be run over the south western road while i was in this dilemma col magruder and marsh fouché came out of the crowd and hailed me they said they were on furlough and trying to make their way to uncle fouché's plantation in appling county i told them my troubles and they went to hunt up fred for me but must have gotten swallowed up in the crowd themselves for i never saw either of them again at last i sent for the conductor to unlock the door so that i could get out of the car and begin a search on my own account just as i had stepped out on the platform fred himself came pushing through the crowd and sprang up beside me he said that some of the passengers who had come with us from cuthbert happened to hear him say that he was going to south west georgia to get his sisters and told him that we were there from fort valley we traveled without interruption to macon where the excitement is at its climax the yankees are expected here at any moment from both north and south having divided their forces at tuskegee it is said and sent one column by way of union springs and columbus and another through opelika and west point i saw some poor little fortifications thrown up along the line of the south western with a handful of men guarding them and that is the only preparation for defense i have seen we are told that the city is to be defended but if that is so the lord only knows where the men are to come from the general opinion seems to be that it is to be evacuated and every preparation seems to be going forward to that end all the horses that could be found have been pressed for the removal of government stores and we had great difficulty in getting our baggage from the dépot to the hotel mr legriel's nephew robert scott was at the train to take us out to lily's but fred thought it best for us to stay at the hotel as he wants to leave in the morning by the first train over the macon western mulberry street in front of the lanier house is filled with officers and men rushing to and fro and everything and everybody seems to be in the wildest excitement in the hotel parlor when i came from lily's whom should i find but mr adams our little yankee preacher i used to like him but now i hate to look at him just because he is a yankee what is it i wonder that makes them so different from us even when they mean to be good southerners you can't even make one of them look like us not if you were to dress him up in a full suit of georgia jeans i used to have some christian feeling towards yankees but now that they have invaded our country and killed so many of our men and desecrated so many homes i can't believe that when christ said love your enemies he meant yankees of course i don't want their souls to be lost for that would be wicked but as they are not being punished in this world i don't see how else they are going to get their deserts april 18 tuesday the first train on the georgia r.r from atlanta to augusta was scheduled to run through to day and we started off on the macon western so as to reach atlanta in time to take the next one down to morrow there was such a crowd waiting at the dépot that we could hardly push our way through and when the ladies car was opened there was such a rush that we considered ourselves lucky to get in at all jenny and jule were with us and we were fortunate enough to get seats together fred and mr toombs had great difficulty in getting our trunks aboard and were obliged to leave us to look out for ourselves while they attended to the baggage many people had to leave theirs behind and some decided to stay with their trunks they contained all that some poor refugees had left them the trains that went out this morning were supposed to be the last that would leave the city as the yankees were expected before night and many predicted that we would be captured there was a terrible rush on all the outgoing trains ours had on board a quantity of government specie and the assets of four banks besides private property aggregating all together it was said more than seventeen million dollars and there were somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 passengers people who could not get inside were hanging on wherever they could find a sticking place the aisles and platforms down to the last step were full of people clinging on like bees swarming round the doors of a hive it took two engines to pull us up the heavy grade around vineville and we were more than an hour behind time in starting at that meanwhile all sorts of rumors were flying one had it that the road was cut at jonesborough then at barnesville and finally that a large force of the enemy was at thomaston advancing toward the road with a view to capturing our train i never saw such wild excitement in my life many people left the cars at the last moment before we steamed out preferring to be caught in macon rather than captured on the road but their places were rapidly filled by more adventurous spirits a party of refugees from columbus were seated near us and they seemed nearly crazed with excitement mary eliza rutherford who was always a great scatter brain when i knew her at school was among them and she jumped upon the seat tore down her back hair and went off into regular hysterics at the idea of falling into the hands of the yankees such antics would have been natural enough in the beginning of the war when we were new to these experiences but now that we are all old soldiers and used to raids and vicissitudes people ought to know how to face them quietly of course it would have been dreadful to be captured and have your baggage rifled and lose all your clothes but if the yankees had actually caught us i don't think i would have gone crazy over it so many sensational reports kept coming in that i finally lost patience and felt like saying something cross to everybody that brought me a fresh bit of news before we left macon mr edward shepherd gave me the worst fright i almost ever had by telling me that my trunk and jenny toombs's had been thrown out of the baggage car and were lying on the track but this proved to be a false alarm like so many others then somebody came in and reported that the superintendent of the road had a dispatch in his hand at that moment stating that the enemy was already in barnesville the statement seemed so authoritative that fred went to gen mackall himself and was advised by him to continue his journey as no official notice had been received of the cutting of the road at last to the great relief of us all the train steamed out of macon and traveled along in peace till it reached goggins's station four miles from barnesville where it was stopped by some country people who said that the down train from atlanta had been captured and the yankees were just five miles beyond barnesville waiting for us a council was held by the railroad officials and some of the army officers on board at which it was decided that the freight we were carrying was too valuable to be risked although the news was not very reliable having been brought in by two schoolboys there was danger also it was suggested that a raiding party might mistake such a very long and crowded train where the men were nearly all forced out on the platforms for a movement of troops and fire into us i confess to being pretty badly scared at this possibility but the women on board seemed to have worked off their excitement by this time and we all kept quiet and behaved ourselves very creditably while the council was still in session fresh reports came in confirming those already brought and we put back to macon without standing on the order of our going helen swift a friend of the toombses who had joined us at macon lives only fifteen miles from the place where we turned back she was bitterly disappointed and i don't blame her for nearly crying her eyes out mr adams undertook to administer spiritual consolation but i don't think helen was very spiritually minded towards yankees just at that time excited crowds were waiting at all the stations as we went back and the news we brought increased the ferment tenfold the general impression seems to be that the yanks are advancing upon macon in three columns and that they will reach the city by tomorrow or next day at latest we came back to the lanier house and fred hopes to get us out by way of milledgeville before they arrive when our train got back to macon the men on board had gradually dropped off on the way so that i don't suppose there were more than 200 or 300 remaining of all that had gone out in the morning the demoralization is complete we are whipped there is no doubt about it everybody feels it and there is no use for the men to try to fight any longer though none of us like to say so just before we reached macon the down train which had been reported captured overtook us at a siding with the tantalizing news that we might have got through to atlanta if we had gone straight on the yankees were twelve miles off at the time of its reported capture and cut the road soon after it passed there was an immense crowd at the dépot on our return and when i saw what a wild commotion the approach of the yankees created i lost all hope and gave up our cause as doomed we made a brave fight but the odds against us were too great the spell of invincibility has left us and gone over to the heavy battalions of the enemy as i drove along from the station to the hotel i could see that preparations were being made to evacuate the city government stores were piled up in the streets and all the horses and wagons that could be pressed into service were being hastily loaded in the effort to remove them the rush of men had disappeared from mulberry st no more gay uniforms no more prancing horses but only a few ragged foot soldiers with wallets and knapsacks on ready to march heaven knows where gen elzey and staff left early in the morning to take up their new quarters either in augusta or washington and if we had only known it we might have gone out with them i took a walk on the streets while waiting to get my room at the hotel and found everything in the wildest confusion the houses were closed and doleful little groups were clustered about the street corners discussing the situation all the intoxicating liquors that could be found in the stores warehouses and barrooms had been seized by the authorities and emptied on the ground in some places the streets smelt like a distillery and i saw men boys and negroes down on their knees lapping it up from the gutter like dogs little children were staggering about in a state of beastly intoxication i think there can be no more dreary spectacle in the world than a city on the eve of evacuation unless it is one that has already fallen into the hands of the enemy i returned to the hotel with a heavy heart for while out i heard fresh rumors of lee's surrender no one seems to doubt it and everybody feels ready to give up hope it is useless to struggle longer seems to be the common cry and the poor wounded men go hobbling about the streets with despair on their faces there is a new pathos in a crutch or an empty sleeve now that we know it was all for nothing april 19 wednesday milledgeville they began to evacuate the city macon at dusk yesterday and all through the night we could hear the tramp of men and horses mingled with the rattle of artillery and baggage wagons mr toombs was very averse to spending the night in macon and we were all anxious to push ahead to the end of our journey but it was impossible to get a conveyance of any sort sam hardeman jule's devoted spent the evening with us and as they are both very musical we tried to keep up our spirits by singing some of the favorite war songs but they seemed more like dirges now and we gave up and went to our rooms we got to bed early knowing we must be at the dépot betimes in the morning to secure seats on the train for milledgeville and had just thrown ourselves on the bed when jenny and jule came running in frightened out of their wits declaring that a man and his wife were quarreling in the room on one side of them and a party of drunken men on the other trying to open their door they can beat any girls i know stirring up imaginary scarecrows from a ghost to a burglar and we tried to laugh away their foolish fears but as we failed to pacify them we gave up our room to them and took theirs we heard nothing more of either drunken men or domestic broils and were so tired that we slept like logs till some time way in the night we were wakened by a terrific thunder storm a bolt struck one of the lightning rods of the hotel and made such a fearful crash that many of the guests suddenly roused from their sleep took it for a yankee shell and for a time the wildest excitement prevailed capt thomas told me afterwards that he never jumped so far in his life as when roused by that thunderbolt which in his first bewilderment he mistook for the explosion of a shell he didn't want to be killed in his bed now he said after going through the whole four years of the war i had been awake some time listening to the rain when the shock came and knew what it was but i am just as much afraid of thunder and lightning as of yankee bombs and when that bolt struck mett and i flew across the corridor in our nightgowns to find the toombs girls we had some funny experiences for it seems to me that everybody at the hotel was running round promiscuously in the corridors but we were all too much excited to notice each other's dress or rather undress once in my haste i knocked at the wrong door and it was some time before we could find the girls jenny and jule had made for their father's room at the first alarm and thinking they had found it jenny bolted in and called to a man in bed whom she took for her father the man was either too drunk or too much of a gentleman to wake and kept his eyes shut till jenny made her escape when we got back to their room we all four piled into bed together and stayed there till morning but none of us slept much we were up almost by daylight and even then found others starting to the dépot ahead of us there was great difficulty in getting transportation for baggage and we had to foot it ourselves the yankees were expected every minute and as this was our very last chance to escape there was a great rush to get on board the train brother troup had not been able to carry out his order to join gen wofford and sent our trunks to the station on a government wagon and gen cobb gave mr toombs transportation for it on one of his cars as far as milledgeville we gratified a pretty girl from montgomery and her escort by taking their baggage to the station with ours we saw one overloaded team take fright at a car whistle and run away scattering the trunks piled up on it and bursting some of them open a serious misfortune in these times when none of us have clothes to spare we did not wait at the hotel for breakfast but started off on foot with cold biscuits in our hands which were all we had to eat we reached the dépot at least an hour before the schedule time three long trains heavily laden went down the south western and brother troup got aboard one of them i am glad he will be with sister in these trying times there were enough people and baggage still at the dépot to load a dozen trains and the people scrambled for places next the track sidney lanier a friend of fred's was there trying to get aboard one of the outgoing trains fred introduced him but we soon lost each other in the crowd the poor fellow is just up from a spell of typhoid fever and looked as thin and white as a ghost he said harry day was left behind sick in macon when the central train backed up there was such a rush to get aboard that i thought we would have the life squeezed out of us i saw one man knock a woman down and run right over her i hope the yankees will catch him fred and mr toombs had to give their whole attention to the baggage but we girls are all good travelers and having legs of our own which our trunks had not we pushed our way successfully through the crowd i was assisted by mr duval one of cousin bolling's patients whom i met in cuthbert and the four of us were comfortably seated nearly all our companions on yesterday's wild goose chase towards atlanta were aboard and we also found mrs walthall going to washington to visit gen toombs's family and mrs paul hammond on her way to augusta many people had to leave their baggage behind and others still were not able to find even standing room for themselves gov brown was on board and mr toombs introduced him to me he looked at me with a half embarrassed expression and poked out his hand with no pretense at cordiality whether this was due to resentment at father's political stand or merely to preoccupation about his own rather precarious affairs i could not tell he is a regular barebones in appearance thin wiry angular with a sallow complexion and iron gray hair his face wears an expression of self assertion rather than obstinacy and i couldn't help thinking how well he would have fitted in with cromwell's ironsides he had on a rusty short tailed black alpaca coat that had a decidedly home made set he looked joe brown every inch of him and if i had met him in jericho i would have said there goes joe brown but when we reached milledgeville he heaped coals of fire on my head by offering us his carriage to drive to the hotel in every horse mule and vehicle in the place had been pressed for removing the government stores that had been shipped from macon there was not even an ox cart or a negro with a wheel barrow to be hired and the hotel full a mile away and the sun blazing hot still i declined at first for i could not make up my mind to accept a favor from a man whose political course i respected so little but the toombses piled in and the governor himself courteously insisted that the rest of us should follow or he would send the carriage back he said if it was too crowded mett and i then got in and mrs walthall climbed in after us i felt rather ashamed of myself for all the mean things i have said about the old governor but i couldn't help laughing at mrs walthall who overwhelmed him with gracious speeches and then the minute his back was turned shook her fist at him out of the window and added in an undertone but i would help to hang you to morrow you old rascal this is politics i suppose with the s left off at the hotel we found all our traveling companions who had come out from macon with a number of other fugitives and while waiting for fred and mr toombs to hunt up conveyances we amused ourselves getting acquainted and exchanging experiences with our fellow sufferers among the ones i liked best were mrs young and dr morrow from marietta mrs walthall introduced us to her escort col lockett an old bachelor but as foolish about the girls as if he was a widower our pretty girl from montgomery was there too but i did not learn her name and a poor little mrs smith from somewhere with a sick puny baby that everybody felt sorry for mrs howell and mrs wardlaw mother and sister of mrs jefferson davis were also among the unfortunates stranded at that awful milledgeville hotel mrs howell was a stout old lady with a handsome but rather determined face and pretty old fashioned gray curls falling behind her ears col lockett innocently pointed her out to me as the housekeeper when he saw me wandering about in search of a clean towel but i told him i had been at the milledgeville hotel before and he couldn't make me believe that anybody connected with it could show a pound of superfluous flesh a stroke of wisdom on my part that saved me from committing a dreadful faux pas afterwards when we met in the parlor she lost no time in letting us all know that she was the president's mother in law and then went on to pay her compliments to everything and everybody opposed to jeff davis gov brown coming in for the lion's share mrs wardlaw her daughter had a good voice and her sweet singing helped to make the time pass a little less tediously but there her individuality seemed to end capt thomas a young officer traveling with them was charming i don't know how we would have got through that long weary day without him after we had waited a long time fred and mr toombs came in and reported that it was impossible to get a conveyance of any kind to mayfield it was all they could do to get our baggage hauled from the dépot and we would probably have to spend the night where we were every conveyance in town had been pressed for removing government stores where augusta is supposed to be the next objective point of the enemy and milledgeville is directly on the road from there to macon the panic has extended here and everybody that can get out of the way is preparing for flight their experience with sherman's army last winter naturally doesn't make these people long for another visit fred had engaged a two horse wagon for one thousand dollars but while he was having our trunks put on it a government official came up and pressed it as we couldn't help ourselves we resolved to make the best of the situation so we went to our room to get a little rest and make ourselves presentable before dinner time we had engaged a large room with two beds so that we girls could all be together but when we entered our hearts sank accustomed as we are to war time fare there was no slop tub wash basin pitcher nor towels and the walls on each side of the beds were black with tobacco spit the fireplace was a dump heap that was enough to turn the stomach of a pig and over the mantel some former occupant had inscribed this caution one bed has lice in it the other fleas and both bugs chimney smokes better change prompted by curiosity i turned down the cover of one bed and started such a stampede among the bugs that we all made for the door as fast as our feet would carry us and ordered another room which however did not prove much better our next step was to make a foray for water and towels the only water supply we could find was in a big washtub at the head of the stairs where everybody stopped to drink those who had no cups stooping down and lapping it up with their hands or dipping in their heads there was but one chambermaid to the whole establishment and she was as hard to catch as the irishman's flea both fred and mr toombs were off hunting for conveyances so we had to shift for ourselves we tried to ring a bell that hung in the passage but sherman's angels had cut the cord a young captain who was watching our maneuvers advised us to cry fire as the surest way of getting water brought just at this time fred's boy arch came up and we made him shovel some of the dirt out of our room and bring up fresh water in a broken pitcher we found there after making ourselves as decent as circumstances would permit we went down to the dining room there was literally nothing on the table but some broken crockery the remains of sherman's little teaparty but one of the black waiters promised to get us a nice dinner if we would jest have de patience to deviate back to de parlor and wait a little while till he could get it ready he was so polite and plausible that we deviated and after more than half an hour went back to the dining room where we exercised our patience for another half hour when at last he came bustling in with some ham and eggs and raw corn bread i looked about on my plate for a clean spot on which to deposit my share and finding none dabbed it down at random and went for it dirt and all for i was desperately hungry soon after dinner mr toombs came in to say that gov brown had provided him with a conveyance for himself and daughters and they were to start at once after the toombses left mrs walthall asked mett and me to share her room as she was afraid to stay by herself and we too were glad of a companion late in the afternoon we went out and saw the georgia cadets on dress parade in front of the capitol mrs walthall and col lockett joined us there with several gentlemen that we had met at the hotel and we had a fine time among the cadets we recognized milton reese tom hill and davy favor from washington and as soon as the drill was over we went into the capitol with them and saw the destruction the yankees had made the building was shockingly defaced like everything else in milledgeville there don't seem to be a clean or a whole thing left in the town the boys told us that the cadets are so hot against the governor for not ordering them into active service that they had hung him in effigy right there in the capitol grounds his son is among them and the boys say the governor won't let them fight because he is afraid julius might get hurt the truth is they ought all to be at home in their trundle beds julius with the rest for they are nothing but children when we returned to the hotel fred met us with the joyful news that he had found a man with a miserable little wagon and two scrubby mules hid out in the woods who had agreed to take us to mayfield for twenty five hundred dollars provided fred would get his team exempted from empressment he fred went at once to col pickett who granted the exemption and we could be off as early in the morning as we chose we spent part of the evening in the hotel parlor trying to be cheerful by the light of a miserable tallow dip but soon gave it up and came away to our room april 20 thursday sparta ga i went to bed about eleven last night but never slept a wink for bedbugs and cockroaches to say nothing of the diabolical noises in the streets all night long as i lay awake i was disturbed by the sound of men cursing and swearing and singing rowdy songs in and around the hotel about two o'clock in the midst of this pandemonium a string band began to play under our window and it seemed to me i had never heard such heavenly music in my life as this was in contrast with the vile noises i had been listening to about eight o'clock in the morning our wagon was at the door and we bade a joyous farewell to milledgeville it was only a shabby little covered cart with the bows so short that if we attempted to sit upright the cover rested on our heads and the sun baked our brains through it fred and arch had to walk the wretched team being hardly able to carry mett and me and the trunks we traveled at the rate of about two miles an hour and a cost of one hundred dollars a mile the day was intensely hot and the dust stifling i tried to relieve the poor mules by walking up some of the worst hills but the blazing sun got the better of my humanity and i crawled into the wagon again we crossed the oconee on a pontoon bridge where the fat old ferryman now acts as toll collector about a mile beyond the river we turned off and traveled to sparta by a different road from the one we had followed last winter it was longer but better than the other not being so much traveled and we hoped to get rid of some of the dust but in this we were disappointed for we were mixed up all day in an endless succession of wagon trains soldiers and refugees that made us wonder who there was to go by the other road after the first few miles we were so tired that we took off our hats and lay down in the wagon to take a nap when we waked we found that both hats and a basket containing all our toilet articles had jolted out and been lost so many people had passed us that fred said it was no use to try to get them back but i made arch take one of the mules out of the wagon and go back to look for them and as much to my surprise as delight he recovered the basket i was so glad to see it that i forgot to grieve over the hats besides my brush and comb and tooth brush it contained all the leaves of my journal that i have written since leaving home last winter which i had torn out of the book on the stampede from macon fearing my trunk might be lost what a mess there would be if it had been found by some of the people i have been writing about when i once got it back i hardly took my hands off it again all day at noon we dined on a dirty biscuit apiece that we had brought from milledgeville for we could buy nothing to eat along the road the country seems to have pretty well recovered from the effects of sherman's march so far as appearances go the fields are tilled and crops growing but people are still short of provisions and nobody wants to take confederate money the rumors about lee's surrender together with the panicky state of affairs at home have sent our depreciated currency rolling down hill with accelerated velocity between six and seven in the evening we reached sparta and found one hotel closed and the other full of smallpox we didn't like to impose on the hospitality of the simpsons again and col lockett who had secured lodging for mrs walthall at a private house advised us to go on to culver's where we had stopped to change horses last winter but our sorry little team was too broken down to carry us any farther while we were standing in the street discussing what had best be done a nice looking old gentleman called fred aside and insisted that we should go to his house he had heard col lockett call us by name he said and being a great friend and admirer of father's declared that judge andrews's children should never want for a lodging as long as he had a roof over his head he gave his name as harris and said there was not a family in sparta but would be proud to entertain us if they knew who we were so great was their love and respect for our father it made me feel good to hear that for his being such a strong union man has made father unpopular in some parts of the state i hate the old union myself but i love father and it makes me furious for anybody to say anything against him it would seem as if a good many people about here quietly shared his opinions or at any rate respected them for mr soularde and several others came up as soon as they learned our name and invited us to their houses and said it would always be a pleasure to them to entertain any of judge andrews's family we were so tired of being pounded and jolted in our dusty little cart that we preferred walking to mr harris's in spite of the disreputable appearance we made hatless and gloveless and dirty as we were we met the simpson girls on the way with jenny and jule and they invited us to go home with them but mr harris had the first claim and to tell the truth i had taken a liking to him before i had known him ten minutes and would not on any account have missed the pleasure of a nearer acquaintance when we reached his home my anticipations were more than realized it was a large white house in the midst of a beautiful garden where roses of all sorts were running riot filling the air with fragrance and the earth with beauty on the colonnade were a number of guests whom the hospitality of our host had brought together and among them we were delighted to meet again our fellow travelers mrs young and dr morrow mrs harris met us with such a warm motherly welcome that i felt like throwing myself on her breast but remembering how dirty and draggled out i was i practiced the golden rule and did as i would be done by we were shown at once to a beautiful clean room with plenty of water and towels and oh the luxury of a good bath but when i went to get out some clean clothes i found that among other things i had lost my keys and could not get into my trunk i borrowed what i could from metta but her things don't fit me and i made a comical appearance i was too hungry to care however after starving since monday and such a supper as we had was enough to make one forget all the ills of life delicious fresh milk and crabber sweet yellow butter with crisp beaten biscuits to go with it smoking hot waffles and corn batter cakes brown as a nut and crisped round the edges till they looked as if bordered with lace it was a feast for hungry souls to remember after supper we went into the parlor and had music we tried to sing some of our old rebel songs but the words stuck in our throats nobody could sing and then clara harris played dixie but it sounded like a dirge the house was so full that mrs harris was obliged to crowd us a little and mrs morrow shared our room with mett and me we had a funny time talking over our experiences she says that the charming captain fell dead in love with me at milledgeville and was so struck with my appearance that he couldn't rest till he found out my name he asked her all sorts of questions about me and i almost laughed myself hoarse at the extravagant things she told him and she didn't know me either any better than he did but that only made it the more amusing april 21 friday haywood that delicious clean bed in sparta i never had a sweeter sleep in my life than the few hours i spent there fred said we must be off at daylight so as to reach mayfield in time for the train with our sorry team so we bid our hosts good by before going to bed in order not to rouse them at such a heathenish hour but about two o'clock in the morning the whole town was roused by a courier who came in with news that the yankees were in putnam county only twelve miles off it is absurd for people to fly into a panic over every wild rumor that gets afloat but i was glad the courier came for three o'clock was the hour appointed for us to start and i was sleeping so soundly that i am sure i would never have waked in time but for him the moon had just risen as we moved out of sparta and i walked with fred in the pleasant night air till day began to dawn we tried to get breakfast at culver's and again at whaley's the only public houses on the way but were refused at both places so we had to satisfy ourselves with the recollection of mrs harris's good supper and a crust of stale bread that i found in arch's basket we reached mayfield about nine and had to wait an hour for the cars to start mrs hammond had got there before us she said that she could find no shelter the night before and had to sleep out under the trees with her little children she is a sensible woman and didn't seem disposed to make a martyr of herself but i felt ashamed for georgia hospitality our other companions joined us at mayfield and the toombses brought the general with them i was glad to see him safe thus far out of yankee clutches but i would not like to be in his shoes when the end comes he brought confirmation of lee's surrender and of the armistice between johnston and sherman alas we all know only too well what that armistice means it is all over with us now and there is nothing to do but bow our heads in the dust and let the hateful conquerors trample us under their feet there is a complete revulsion in public feeling no more talk now about fighting to the last ditch the last ditch has already been reached no more talk about help from france and england but all about emigration to mexico and brazil we are irretrievably ruined past the power of france and england to save us now europe has quietly folded her hands and beheld a noble nation perish god grant she may yet have cause to repent her cowardice and folly in suffering this monstrous power that has crushed us to roll on unchecked we fought nobly and fell bravely overwhelmed by numbers and resources with never a hand held out to save us i hate all the world when i think of it i am crushed and bowed down to the earth in sorrow but not in shame no i am more of a rebel to day than ever i was when things looked brightest for the confederacy and it makes me furious to see how many union men are cropping up everywhere and how few there are to hear them talk now who really approved of secession though four years ago my own dear old father i hate to say it but he did what he thought was right was almost the only man in georgia who stood out openly for the union we found the railroad between mayfield and camack even more out of repair than when we passed over it last winter and the cars traveled but little faster than our mule team however we reached camack in time for the train from augusta and as we drew up at the platform somebody thrust his head in at the window and shouted lincoln's been assassinated we had heard so many absurd rumors that at first we were all inclined to regard this as a jest somebody laughed and asked if the people of camack didn't know that april fools day was past a voice behind us remarked that balaam's ass wasn't dead yet and was answered by a cry of here's your mule but soon the truth of the report was confirmed some fools laughed and applauded but wise people looked grave and held their peace it is a terrible blow to the south for it places that vulgar renegade andy johnson in power and will give the yankees an excuse for charging us with a crime which was in reality only the deed of an irresponsible madman our papers ought to reprobate it universally about one o'clock we reached barnett where i used to feel as much at home as in washington itself but there was such a crowd such a rush such a hurrying to and fro at the quiet little dépot that i could hardly recognize it the train on our washington branch was crammed with soldiers i saw no familiar face except mr edmundson the conductor there is so much travel over this route now that three or four trains are run between washington and barnett daily and sometimes double that number we looked out eagerly for the first glimpse of home and when the old town clock came into view a shout of joy went up from us returning wanderers when we drew up at the dépot amid all the bustle and confusion of an important military post i could hardly believe that this was the same quiet little village we had left sleeping in the winter sunshine five months ago long trains of government wagons were filing through the streets and we ran against squads of soldiers at every turn father met us at the dépot delighted to have us under his protection once more and the rest of the family with old toby frisking and barking for joy were waiting for us at the street gate mary day isn't able to walk that far yet but we met her in the sitting room she is not exactly pretty but what i should call picturesque looking and her eyes are beautiful oh what a happy meeting we all had and how beautiful home does look with the green leaves on the trees and the cherokee roses in full bloom flinging their white festoons clear over the top of the big sycamore by the gate surely this old home of ours is the choicest spot of all the world the first thing we did after seeing everybody and shaking hands all round with the negroes was to take a good bath and i had just finished dressing when mrs elzey called with cousin bolling's friend capt hudson of richmond he was an attaché of the american legation in berlin while cousin bolling was there studying his profession and they have both come back with the charming manners and small affectations that americans generally acquire in europe especially if they have associated much with the aristocracy people may laugh but these polished manners do make men very nice and comfortable to be with they are so adaptable and always know just the right thing to say and do mrs elzey says the general is coming to washington with the rest of his staff to remain till something is decided and we begin to know what is before us april 22 saturday i went to bed as soon as i had eaten supper last night and never did i enjoy a sweeter rest home beds are cleaner and softer than any others even mrs harris's i spent the better part of the day unpacking and arranging my things the house is so crowded with company that i have had to give up my room and double in with mett i keep my clothes wherever i can find a place for them we went to walk after dinner and found the streets swarming with people paroled men from lee's army are expected every day now and the town is already as full as it can hold the only hotel has been closed and private hospitality is taxed to the utmost while we were out the toombs girls called with john ficklen and that nice capt thomas we met in milledgeville april 23 sunday gen elzey and staff arrived early in the afternoon and called here at once the general has a fine soldierly appearance and charming manners like all west pointers except of course those brutes like butler and sherman and their murderous clan capt irwin mrs elzey's brother is going to stay at our house and the whole family has fallen in love with him at first sight he is the dearest jolliest fellow that ever lived and keeps up his spirits under circumstances that would have put down even mark tapley his wife and six daughters are in the enemy's lines at norfolk six daughters in these awful times and the father of them can still laugh he has a way of screwing up his face when he says anything funny that gives him an indescribably comical appearance this is enhanced by a little round bald head like santa claus the result of a singular accident while he was still a young man at a dinner party given on the occasion of a wedding in the family one of the servants let fall a hot oyster pate on top of his head it blistered the scalp so that the hair fell out and never grew back he must have been very good natured not to assassinate that servant on the spot april 24 monday the shattered remains of lee's army are beginning to arrive there is an endless stream passing between the transportation office and the dépot and trains are going and coming at all hours the soldiers bring all sorts of rumors and keep us stirred up in a state of never ending excitement our avenue leads from the principal street on which they pass and great numbers stop to rest in the grove emily is kept busy cooking rations for them and pinched as we are ourselves for supplies it is impossible to refuse anything to the men that have been fighting for us even when they don't ask for anything the poor fellows look so tired and hungry that we feel tempted to give them everything we have two nice looking officers came to the kitchen door this afternoon while i was in there making some sorghum cakes to send to gen elzeys camp they then walked slowly through the back yard and seemed reluctant to tear themselves away from such a sweet beautiful place nearly everybody that passes the street gate stops and looks up the avenue and i know they can't help thinking what a beautiful place it is the cherokee rose hedge is white with blooms it is glorious a great many of the soldiers camp in the grove though col weems the confederate commandant of the post has located a public camping ground for them further out of town the officers often ask for a night's lodging but our house is always so full of friends who have a nearer claim that a great many have to be refused it hurts my conscience ever to turn off a confederate soldier on any account but we are so overwhelmed with company friends and people bringing letters of introduction that the house big as it is will hardly hold us all and members of the family have to pack together like sardines capt john nightingale's servant came in this afternoon the little johnny nightingale i used to play with down on the old tallassee plantation but reports that he does not know where his master is he says the yankees captured him the negro and took away his master's horse that he was tending but as soon as night came on he made his escape on another horse that he took from them and put out for home he says he don't like the yankees because they didn't show no respec for his feelin's he talks with a strong salt water brogue and they laughed at him which he thought very ill mannered father sent him round to the negro quarters to wait till his master turns up april 25 tuesday maj hall one of gen elzey's staff has been taken with typhoid fever so father sent out to the camp and told them to bring him to our house but mrs robertson had a spare room at the bank and took him there where he can be better cared for than in our house that is full as an ant hill already i went round to the bank after breakfast to see mrs elzey and inquire about him the square is so crowded with soldiers and government wagons that it is not easy to make way through it it is especially difficult around the government offices where the poor ragged starved and dirty remnants of lee's heroic army are gathered day and night the sidewalk along there is alive with vermin and some people say they have seen lice crawling along on the walls of the houses poor fellows this is worse than facing yankee bullets these men were most of them born gentlemen and there could be no more pitiful evidence of the hardships they have suffered than the lack of means to free themselves from these disgusting creatures even dirt and rags can be heroic sometimes at the spring in our grove where the soldiers come in great numbers to wash their faces and sometimes their clothes lice have been seen crawling in the grass so that we are afraid to walk there little washington is now perhaps the most important military post in our poor doomed confederacy the naval and medical departments have been moved here what there is left of them soon all this will give place to yankee barracks and our dear old confederate gray will be seen no more the men are all talking about going to mexico and brazil if all emigrate who say they are going to we shall have a nation made up of women negroes and yankees i joined a party after dinner in a walk out to the general camping ground in cousin will pope's woods the irvin artillery are coming in rapidly i suppose they will all be here by the end of the week or what is left of them but their return is even sadder and amid bitterer tears than their departure for now we weep as they that have no hope everybody is cast down and humiliated and we are all waiting in suspense to know what our cruel masters will do with us think of a vulgar plebeian like andy johnson and that odious yankee crew at washington lording it over southern gentlemen i suppose we shall be subjected to every indignity that hatred and malice can heap upon us till it comes let us eat drink and be merry for to morrow we die only we have almost nothing to eat and to drink and still less to be merry about our whirlwind of a cousin robert ball has made his appearance but is hurrying on to new orleans and says he has but one day to spend with us the whole world seems to be moving on washington now an average of 2,000 rations are issued daily and over 15,000 men are said to have passed through already since it became a military post though the return of the paroled men has as yet hardly begun april 26 wednesday gen elzey lent his ambulances and we had a charming little picnic under the management of capt hardy we left town at seven o'clock before the sun was too hot and drove to a creek ten miles out where we spent the day in a beautiful grove so shady that the sun could not penetrate at noon day gen elzey and all the staff were there our amusements were cards fishing in the creek rambling about through the woods and sitting in little circles on the grass talking about what we are going to do under the new order of things some comical pictures were drawn of our future occupations and we guyed each other a good deal about our prospects i am to take in washing mett to raise chickens and peddle them in a cart drawn by dixie capt irwin is to join the minstrels and capt palfrey to be a dancing master but down in the bottom of our hearts we felt that there is likely to be little occasion for laughter in the end the drive home was rather hot and dusty and our enjoyment was damped by the sight of the poor soldiers that we met trundling along the road they looked so weary and ragged and travel stained many of them overcome with fatigue were lying down to rest on the bare ground by the roadside i felt ashamed of myself for riding when they had to walk these are the straggling remnants of those splendid armies that have been for four years a terror to the north the glory of the south and the wonder of the world alas alas april 27 thursday robert ball left for new orleans mary day for a short visit to augusta and cora returned from there where she had gone to bid farewell to general and mrs fry who have arranged to make their future home in cuba the elzeys and many other visitors called during the evening we had a delightful serenade in the night but toby kept up such a barking that we couldn't half get the good of it their songs were all about the sea so i suppose the serenaders were naval officers the navy department has been ordered away from here and washington would seem a very queer location for a navy that had any real existence capt parker sent lieut peck this morning with a letter to father and seven great boxes full of papers and instruments belonging to the department which he requested father to take care of father had them stored in the cellar the only place where he could find a vacant spot and so now about all that is left of the confederate navy is here in our house and we laugh and tell father that he the staunchest union man in georgia is head of the confederate navy april 28 friday dr aylett one of the lecturers at bellevue hospital when henry was a student there took breakfast with us he is stone blind and making his way to selma ala attended only by a negro boy if the negro should desert he would be in a forlorn plight though he does seem to have a wonderful faculty for taking care of himself i have heard henry say he used to find his way about in new york city with no guide but his stick as readily as if he had had eyes i was busy all the morning helping to get ready for a supper that father gave to gen elzey and staff the table was beautiful it shone like a mirror there were seats for twenty two and everything on it solid silver except the cups and saucers and plates which were of beautiful old china that had belonged to cora's grandmother but it was all in absurd contrast to what we had to eat the cake was all made of sorghum molasses and the strawberries were sweetened with the coarsest kind of brown sugar but we were glad to have even that and it tasted good to us hungry rebs emily was kept so busy all day cooking rations for soldiers that she hardly had time for anything else and i was so sorry for the poor fellows that no matter what i happened to have in my hand if a soldier came up and looked wistfuly at it i couldn't help giving it to him some of them as they talked to me about the surrender would break down and cry like children i took all the lard and eggs mother had left out for emily to cook with and gave to them because i could not bear to see them eating heavy old biscuit made of nothing but flour and water in this way a good part of our supper was disposed of before we sat down to it but nobody grudged the loss in spite of his being such a strong union man and his bitter opposition to secession father never refuses anything to the soldiers i blame the secession politicians myself but the cause for which my brothers risked their lives the cause for which so many noble southerners have bled and died and for which such terrible sacrifices have been made is dear to my heart right or wrong the more misfortunes overwhelm my poor country the more i love it the more the yankees triumph the worse i hate them wretches i would rather be wrong with men like lee and davis than right with a lot of miserable oppressors like stanton and thad stevens the wrong of disrupting the old union was nothing to the wrongs that are being done for its restoration we had a delightful evening in spite of the clouds gathering about us the toombses popes mary wynn mr saile and capt john garnett our virginia cousin were invited to meet the general and staff capt garnett is one of the handsomest men i ever saw with magnificent black eyes and hair but seems to me wanting in vivacity i reckon it is because he is in love with a frisky widow who is leading him a dance for the gentlemen all like him and say that he has a great deal of dry humor we had several sets of the lancers and prince imperial interspersed with waltzes and galops and wound up with an old fashioned virginia reel gen elzey and i leading off the general is too nice for anything i told mrs elzey that if she hadn't had first chance at him i would fall over head and ears in love with him myself april 29 saturday visitors all day in shoals and swarms capt irwin brought judge crump of richmond to stay at our house he is an ugly old fellow with a big nose but perfectly delightful in conversation and father says he wishes he would stay a month capt irwin seems very fond of him and says there is no man in virginia more beloved and respected he is assistant secretary of the treasury or something of the sort and is wandering about the country with his poor barren exchequer trying to protect what is left of it for the payment of confederate soldiers he has in charge also the assets of some richmond banks of which he is or was president dum troja fuit he says that in augusta he met twenty five of his clerks with ninety five barrels of papers not worth a pin all put together which they had brought out of richmond while things of real value were left a prey to the enemy april 30 sunday we were all standing under the ash tree by the fountain after breakfast watching the antics of a squirrel up in the branches when gen elzey and touch name by which the general's son arnold a lad of 14 was known among his friends came to tell us that garnett was wounded in the fight at salisbury n c mr saile brought the news from augusta but could give no particulars except that his wound was not considered dangerous and that his galvanized yanks behaved badly as anybody might have known they would a little later the mail brought a letter from gen gardiner his commanding officer entirely relieving our fears for his personal safety he is a prisoner but will soon be paroled when i came in from church in the afternoon i found burton harrison mr davis's private secretary among our guests he is said to be engaged to the miss constance carey of whom my old montgomery acquaintance that handsome ed carey used to talk so much he came in with mrs davis who is being entertained at dr ficklen's nobody knows where the president is but i hope he is far west of this by now all sorts of ridiculous rumors are afloat concerning him one that he passed through town yesterday hid in a box marked specie might better begin with an h others equally reliable appoint every day in the week for his arrival in washington with a bodyguard of 1,000 men but i am sure he has better sense than to travel in such a conspicuous way mr harrison probably knows more about his whereabouts than anybody else but of course we ask no questions mrs davis herself says that she has no idea where he is which is the only wise thing for her to say the poor woman is in a deplorable condition no home no money and her husband a fugitive she says she sold her plate in richmond and in the stampede from that place the money all but fifty dollars was left behind i am very sorry for her and wish i could do something to help her but we are all reduced to poverty and the most we can do is for those of us who have homes to open our doors to the rest if secession were to do over i expect father's warning voice would no longer be silenced by jeers and i would no more be hooted at as the daughter of a submissionist but i have not much respect for the sort of union men that are beginning to talk big now and hope my father will never turn against his own people like that infamous committee of seventeen in savannah right or wrong i believe in standing by your own people especially when they are down
jan 1st 1865 what a bright new year if only the sunshine be a presage of happier days cold but clear and sunny such a contrast to yesterday's tears with this bright sun shining on me i can't feel as mournful as i did yesterday i will try to throw off the sad memories i was brooding over and hope for better things i will try to forget my struggles and failures and disappointments and begin again with new resolutions oh me i haven't much confidence in my ability to keep them yesterday we had a letter from my darling father he was at thomasville he has been gone two weeks and i suppose by this time he is at the altamaha the gulf road only runs thus far and there he will have to stop and get word if possible to aunt jane with sallie cousin ada and cousin annie to meet him if that is impossible he will try to make his way through the lines to them though i never say anything about it i feel uneasy in regard to father the yankees have been through liberty county burning and destroying and i hear they have passed right through our plantations father says however that he has heard of no outrages committed but how dreadfully they must have been frightened and what is worse if the provisions have been destroyed they may be suffering the uncertainty is very horrible but how accustomed we have grown to what is horrible we had a letter from grandma too she had left us to be with aunt sallie in her confinement she gives a long account of her journey performed mostly in government waggons with lee's men poor aunt sallie suffered dreadfully and her babe was born dead the result of the fright she experienced when the enemy passed through milledgeville the old year did not die without bringing us one more piece of bad news we heard yesterday that gen price old dad price was dead misfortunes assail us on every side the president however is quite well again what a sinking of despair i had when i heard that he was dead jan 2nd this day's entry being filled with speculations on and arguments for and against the immortality of the soul etc i therefore extract only a short entry made before going to bed have just returned from aunt josie's where we spent the evening in company with capt and mrs green we had a very pleasant evening and were regaled in honour of the new year which yesterday being sunday was celebrated today with egg nog confederate cake and pop corn capt green of the nitre bureau is an odd sort of man and his wife is awfully ugly no more news today except that i heard that jeff davis said that he would defend carolina at all hazards i hope it is true but i do not believe it jan 4th what a budget of bad news this morning four letters one from father who writes from camp at doctortown only fifteen miles from halifax but he cannot get there he had sent word to aunt jane by some scouts to try to reach him with the girls but how can they when every mule and horse has been taken they could only walk and that of course would be impracticable father said the yanks made a clean sweep of everything and we have lost all our worldly possessions except the few negroes here perhaps aunt jane's family and sallie are almost starving oh it is too dreadful to think of a second letter from aunt ann in baker county says that will and joe henry quarterman seeing the outrageous conduct of the yankees in one of the upper counties mounted and rode night and day to reach liberty in time to beseech their mother and sisters to run anywhere rather than encounter such fiends the house was surrounded so says report willy was killed joe henry mortally wounded and gus taken prisoner cousin corinne's husband was found in the swamp how i hope it is not true poor aunt harriet she has so recently buried her husband and daughter and oh what are my feelings when i think of aunt jane annie and ada and poor little sallie what fate may not have overtaken them alone as they are upon the plantation and father i cannot bear to think of him every day i tremble with the fear that i may hear he is a prisoner or killed killed oh no god would not be so cruel as that i could not think of that my darling precious father if you were only safe at home again grandma writes more dreadful accounts of outrages and horrors that happened in milledgeville walter writes from the hospital in charleston that he has been laid up with chills and fever as a consequence of the terrible march after the evacuation of savannah he has got transferred to our college hospital and we expect to see him this evening i am constantly thinking of the time when columbia will be given up to the enemy the horrible picture is constantly before my mind they have promised to show no mercy in this state mother wants to send me off but of course i would not leave her i can only hope their conduct in a city will not be so shocking as it has been through the country yet no doubt the college buildings will be burned with other public buildings and we will at least lose our home jan 6th a horrid day rain rain rain i have been sitting over the fire knitting and reading mother sitting opposite with her knitting asked me such endless questions in regard to her stocking that i put down my book impatiently and am trying to write i feel awfully cross and out of sorts and can't at all understand how so simple an affair as knitting a stocking should appear an insoluble problem mother can't conquer the mystery of turning the heel there it is again emma how many times did you say i must knit plain i think i shall put my pen down and run away it was brighter this afternoon in spite of the angry clouds the sun was setting as we finished dinner and i brought my book out on the piazza where the rosy clouds divided my attention with the pages when mother came and asked me to take carrie i fear i did so ill naturedly but the little darling's laughing face and merry blue eyes soon put me in a better humor and i raced up and down with her till jane came when i ran upstairs brushed my hair and coming down again found the moonlight struggling through the clouds jan 10th what a day the rain is sweeping down in torrents and the earth is flooded not a living creature to be seen not even a benighted soldier in the campus usually so alive with them nothing but the driving rain and rushing water it is perfectly splendid jan 12th last night cousin lula and johnnie came over and we all mother mr memminger son of father's old friend col memminger and who had been with us for quite a while before father left and still seems like a member of the family walter cousin lula and myself gathered round the table and made kiss verses all the evening for our grand bazaar as might be supposed there was lots of nonsense and laughing over our work if i except walter who was as silent as usual i do not know what is the matter with him he used to be so very talkative and now he is so gloomy perhaps it is his health troops have been passing through columbia for some days and i feel a little safer though if joe johnston is put in command we had as well pack up and prepare to run he will certainly execute one of his masterly retreats from the coast back to virginia and leave us at sherman's mercy i hear that sherman has drawn his troops back from south carolina to savannah some think this bodes ill for gen hood who is in alabama or mississippi or somewhere else and may be caught in a trap between sherman and thomas i hope not cousin lula says they had a letter from julian yesterday he who used to be such an ardent georgian is down on the state for behaving so shamefully he says all his company have abjured their state and made a vow never to live in it especially in savannah as for me i am a south carolinian i have lived here almost since i can remember and only wish i had been born here instead of in georgia that whole state is utterly demoralized and ready to go back into the union savannah has gone down on her knees and humbly begged pardon of father abraham gratefully acknowledging sherman's clemency in burning and laying waste their state oh it is a crying shame such poltronnery father writes that he will try to get them all out of liberty county under a flag of truce i wish he would make haste and come home who can tell how soon communication may be cut off jan between the 13th and 17th we have no more news from father this morning indeed there are no mails the late freshet has carried away the bridges over the edisto the greenville road is so injured that it cannot be repaired under three weeks an and worse still the danville road upon which lee depends for his supplies cannot be used for ten days and he is short of provisions the very elements conspire against us madame deovilliere is going to make us repeat our comedy that came off with so much eclat in the fall we rehearse this afternoon jan 18th well our great bazaar opened last night and such a jam i was at the state house helping to arrange the tables until four o'clock so i was thoroughly tired there are seven booths in the house of representatives south carolina at the speaker's desk is the largest and on either side are texas tennessee virginia mississippi louisiana and missouri in the senate are north carolina at the desk arkansas georgia alabama and florida the tables or booths are tastefully draped with damask and lace curtains and elaborately decorated with evergreens to go in there one would scarce believe it was war times the tables are loaded with fancy articles brought through the blockade or manufactured by the ladies everything to eat can be had if one can pay the price cakes jellies creams candies every kind of sweets abound a small slice of cake is two dollars a spoonful of charlotte russe five dollars and other things in proportion some beautiful imported wax dolls not more than twelve inches high raffled for five hundred dollars and one very large doll i heard was to raffle for two thousand why as uncle john says one could buy a live negro baby for that how can people afford to buy toys at such a time as this however i suppose speculators can a small sized cake at the tennessee table sold for seventy five dollars the bazaar will continue until saturday they had intended holding it for two weeks but sherman's proximity forces them to hurry up i heard but it is only one of mr johnston's stories that the aforesaid individual had announced his intention of attending the ladies bazaar in person before it closes the railroads are so broken up that we can hear nothing definite but report says that sherman is marching one column on augusta and one on branchville one piece of bad news is certain namely that fort fisher has fallen at last i had expected to take great interest in the soldier's bazaar but i cannot it seems like the dance of death and who can tell that sherman may not get the money that was made instead of our sick soldiers how long before our beautiful little city may be sacked and laid in ashes dear columbia with its lovely trees and gardens it is heart sickening to think of it grandpa wants to leave for georgia as soon as the trains run through which will be on friday and he wants to take me with him but i think mother and i had better stay or run together we are going to pack up father's books and as many things as we can and get those of our friends who remain to take care of them as almost any house in the town will be safer than these buildings then perhaps we may run with uncle john's family to whatever point he moves the nitre bureau works oh it is so dreadful and yet how callous our hearts have grown two years ago with what despairing agony i would have looked upon the prospect before us and now i only feel a dull heart pain if we were anywhere but in this state it would not be so horrible but who can tell what will be our fate oh if father were only at home to advise us what to do sometimes i wonder i can be so calm we have not heard from him in two weeks he may be in augusta or brachville waiting to get through but if sherman should reach those places before him and cut him off from us oh this fearful uncertainty is heartrending jan 21st sunday news from father and sallie at last they are safe and i am so happy now doubly happy now that i know all that he has endured and escaped he was a week in the county surrounded by yankees he walked 72 miles in three days sallie and cousin annie and ada be sent out by a flag of truce poor sallie gives a dreadful account of her adventures she walked half the distance of doctortown camping out in the woods at night with no shelter crossing burnt trestles and swollen streams on logs poor child if you were only safe at home again the nearer the time approaches the longer and more weary it seems father's letter was dated the 9th sallie's from thomasville the 12th while they awaited a conveyance to take them to albany so as soon as the road is repaired which will be on tuesday or wednesday i shall begin to hope for them sallie has been gone nearly three months and father five or six weeks a new trouble walter is down with the measles and we fear if little carrie should get them it will kill her in her delicate state of health mother is trying very hard to keep her from the infection things are looking very gloomy i heard gov magrath had received orders to hold charleston but mr memminger who was here yesterday says it is being evacuated they say richmond and petersburg are to be given up and lee's army fall back to south carolina that would be safer for us but who could endure the idea of giving up richmond glorious old richmond that we have been defending so long to fall after all those battles that would be the darkest darkest day of all everyone seems to feel that columbia is doomed aunt josie thinks we had all better run off with the nitre bureau and camp in the woods of north carolina till danger is over they say sherman is massing his forces at branchville oh what times to live in who knows what may become of us in ten days columbia is thought in so much danger that the ladies closed the bazaar on friday yet all this does not rouse us we seem sunk in an apathy nothing could surprise me now unless some wonderful help should break in upon our trouble and give us the independence we have been longing and fighting for all these sad years even my books fail to keep my attention jan 22 mr pond has arrived in columbia with his command he says butler's cavalry five thousand strong will be stationed here for the present so we will have some security at least from raids we can hear no news from the army except that hood has been relieved of the command at his own desire taylor is in command pro tem no one seems to know the whereabouts of either hood or thomas there is talk in congress of making a commander in chief and some recommend joe johnston gen lee is the only man for that office jan 23rd no more news from father i begin to think he has stayed to get the negroes out we hear so many rumors of the movements of the yankees and of our own troops but they are not worth noting mother has packed up the clothing and bed linen that we may save those at least all the books are packed too i have not been in the library since they were taken down it would make me too sad to look at the empty shelves it may be of interest some day to recall the poor style in which we lived during the war so i shall make a few notes my underclothing is of coarse unbleached homespun such as we gave the negroes formerly only much coarser my stockings i knit myself and my shoes are of heavy calfskin my dresses are two calicoes the last one bought cost sixteen dollars a yard a homespun of black and white plaid and an old delaine of pre war times that hangs on in a dilapidated condition a reminiscence of better days we have a couple of old silks carefully preserved for great occasions and which do not look shabby for the simple reason that all the other old silks that still survive the war are in the same state of decay the homespun cost about eight or ten dollars a yard calico is 20 to 30 dollars a yard now and going higher from week to week my shoes are 150 dollars a pair in two or three months these prices will be doubled we live tolerably poorly two meals a day two plates of bread for breakfast one of wheat flour as five bags of flour were recently made a present to us else we would only have corn bread corn itself is forty dollars a bushel dinner consists of a very small piece of meat generally beef a few potatoes and a dish of hominy and a pone of corn bread we have no reason to complain so many families are so much worse off many have not tasted meat for months and we too having a cow are able to have butter wood is hard to get at one hundred dollars a load we keep but one fire in the dining room where we sit we have been fortunate in having gas thus far at eighty dollars a thousand but since the freshet the supply of rosin has been deficient and now and then it is cut off and we burn tallow candles at two dollars apiece we never have sweet things now and even molasses candy is a rarity seldom to be thought of jan 25th last night while i was lying on the sofa feeling very blue and full of gloomy thoughts in regard to the war and the dreadful possibility of the south having to yield uncle h john came in the library and said well have you heard the last report it is said that england and france conjointly will certainly recognize us by the fourth of march i jumped up with the first thrill of real joy i have felt for a long time a bright vista of peace and happiness seemed to open up before my mind's eye of course a moment's reflection sobered me and brought me back to common sense i recollected with a sigh how often we had been disappointed and lured on to false hopes by that will o the wisp recognition and intervention yet there are some circumstances that lend a slight colouring of possible truth to this rumor although at the height of their success the yankees are making fair proposals through their commissioner blair if the south will only yield slavery dispatches say that much excitement prevails in richmond gold has fallen and the people are selling out i think i would rather the south were conquered than that she should make peace with them father has not come home yet and we hear nothing how tired we are of waiting how i long to see them today is johnny's birthday he is fifteen mother sent him one of our cobwebbed bottles of champagne a few still lurk in the pantry i tell mother she must keep some for peace if we ever live to see it jan 27th another day and the long looked for have not returned later we have just received a letter from sallie she and cousins annie and ada are in macon with our relatives the clifford andersons while father has returned to attempt to save aunt jane by flag of truce sallie entreats us to run if there is the slightest danger from yankees oh mother she says i never want to see them again cousin ada in a letter to aunt josie gives a sad account of all they suffered and the brutal rudeness of the soldiers i am so sorry for her she and aunt jane are turned adrift homeless and destitute jan 28th grandpa leaves for macon the day after tomorrow monday mother wanted to send me with him but we came to the conclusion we had best not leave home or separate till father comes mr memminger was here this evening to bid us goodbye he places no confidence in rumors of foreign aid he left early and a few minutes after dr nat pratt dropped in and talked more cheerfully he seems quite confident we will hear tomorrow that an armistice of 60 days has been declared having learned that gen hampton has received a telegram to that effect gen lee has been made generalissimo and hood has taken leave of his army his farewell address is very manly he shoulders the whole responsibility of his campaign says he did his best and failed the weather is intensely fearfully cold walter is getting on very well but is breaking out in boils now how dreadfully sick i am of this war trully we girls whose lot it is to grow up in these times are unfortunate it commenced when i was thirteen and i am now seventeen and no prospect yet of its ending no pleasure no enjoyment nothing but rigid economy and hard work nothing but the stern realities of life those which should come later are made familiar to us at an age when only gladness should surround us we have only the saddest anticipations and the dread of hardships and cares when bright dreams of the future ought to shine on us i have seen little of the light heartedness and exuberant joy that people talk about as the natural heritage of youth it is a hard school to be bred up in and i often wonder if i will ever have my share of fun and happiness if it had not been for my books it would indeed have been hard to bear but in them i have lived and found my chief source of pleasure i would take refuge in them from the sadness all around if it were not for other work to be done i do all my own sewing now besides helping mother some now that everything is lost perhaps we will all have to work for a living before long i would far rather do that and bear much more than submit to the yankees jan 29th sunday dr gibbs said yesterday he was quite sure of the fact that alex stephens i r campbell and r m t hunter had gone to washington to treat for peace there is a general feeling throughout the south that we will have peace before long there have been these national presentiments before however and i cannot give much heed to this one the whole atmosphere is filled with the wildest rumors it is hard to study in the present state of affairs and since father has been away i have only tried to read again yet in the uncertainty of everything i feel more than ever the pressing necessity of gaining an education and that i ought to try to persevere in working at it i could not very well study physics and latin while father is away but i might finish conic sections and review some mathematics all our future is so uncertain we cannot look beyond the present moment jan 31st just a month since i commenced writing only a month yet how many changes even in that short time grandpa left us yesterday for georgia i have just written again to sallie she may have left macon before my letter reaches her but if not the poor child will be anxious enough for news from home
columbia south carolina dec 31st 1864 the last day of the year always a gloomy day doubly so today dark leaden clouds cover the sky and ceaseless pattering rain that has been falling all day the air is chill and damp and the morning wind fills one with melancholy a fit conclusion for such a year tis meet old year that thou should'st weep for the misfortunes thou hast brought our country and what hope is there to brighten the new year that is coming up alas i cannot look forward to the new year my thoughts still cling to the mouldering past yes the year that is dying has brought us more trouble than any of the other three long dreary years of this fearful struggle georgia has been desolated the resistless flood has swept through that state leaving but a desert to mark its track and now our hateful foes hold savannah noble old charleston is at last to be given up they are preparing to hurl destruction upon the state they hate most of all and sherman the brute avows his intention of converting south carolina into a wilderness not one house he says shall be left standing and his licentious troops whites and negroes shall be turned loose to ravage and violate all that is between us and our miserable fate is a handful of raw militia assembled near branchville and yet they may say there is a providence who fights for those who are struggling for freedom who are defending their homes and all that is held dear yet these vandals these fiends incarnate are allowed to overrun our land oh my country will i live to see thee subjugated and enslaved by these yankees surely every man and woman will die first on every side they threaten lee's noble army alone stands firm foreign nations look on our sufferings and will not help us our men are being killed off boys of sixteen are conscripted speculators and extortioners are starving us but is this a time to talk of submission now when the yankees have deepened and widened the breach by a thousand new atrocities a sea rolls between them and us a sea of blood smoking houses outraged women murdered fathers brothers and husbands forbid such a union reunion great heavens how we hate them with the whole strength and depth of our souls i wonder if the new year is to bring us new miseries and sufferings i am afraid so we used to have bright anticipations of peace and happiness for the new year but now i dare not look forward hope has fled and in its place remains only a spirit of dogged sullen resistance
feb 1st what a delightful day it is so balmy and delicious it is almost oppressive in the sunshine and only the bare trees remind one that it is winter it is one of those luxurious days that we often have in our southern february in which the warm sleepy air seems inviting to dreams and every sound has a softened far off cadence not a breeze is stirring and even animals seem to saunter along dreamily what a climate would ours be were it not for these cold spells we have now and then sunday it was freezing today it is spring i came out on the piazza to read but fell to thinking instead of just such days two years ago cousin annie was here and how we wandered over the woods and the fields with jule sometimes sitting on the brown pine straw under that great old pine tree by the gurgling spring talking lazily in the warm sunshine what a happy pleasant winter it was and how long ago it seems when shall we three meet again never under like circumstances she is married and julian in the army fighting for his country i only am left in the old place we have received a letter from father at last is that not good news but my poor darling father what he has suffered there were no yankees this time but he had the elements to contend with and his sufferings were more than the last it was during those terrible rains and for five days and nights he was on his feet wet to the skin and sleeping in that condition he worked like a negro carrying aunt jane's baggage and enduring every kind of fatigue he crossed the altamaha when it was so swollen by the freshet that experienced boatmen thought he risked his life what i dread is that he may yet be sick from the re action i reproach myself a thousand times that i have not felt more anxious about my precious father but indeed we had not the slightest thought that he would meet with any obstacle this time father said he would be home about the first so i look for him friday or saturday how will i feel when they are all once more safe at home i think my heart will overflow with joy and thankfulness night still more rumors peace rumors relative to the blair mission and our own commissioners in washington i am not hopeful but every one around me seems so confident that i cannot help being infected more or less with the general feeling feb 2nd thursday i cannot expect it yet i do hope the long watched for ones will come tonight it is almost impossible yet i long for them so not only to feel that father were safe at home that were a weight off one's heart but there is another anxiety now little carrie has the measles dr thomson said so this morning and we are so distressed about it i am so anxious about my little darling and so sorry father will find her sick she has been so well since he left till now feb 5th sunday a rainy day and consequently neither mother nor i went to church last evening mrs caldwell sent word that her father had seen dr leconte in macon and that he bade him tell us he would start home in a few days i put on my hat and shawl and ran around there to learn something more definite but mrs c could not even tell me what day her father was in macon but only that he said father looked quite well but sunburnt from exposure as i returned i stopped to chat with cousin lula on the piazza and lingered so long that the rest of my walk home was through the moonlight it was so lovely and the air so soft and balmy we cannot think what could detain father in macon uncle john thinks the train may come through today if not father may take a government wagon from augusta in which case we may expect him tuesday or wednesday he may return just in time for us to take a toilsome flight for the present plan seems to be to run if the yankees come after the threats uttered in georgia against this state it would seem folly to remain so we propose to accompany the bureau aunt josie says uncle john is putting springs in some of the wagons for our accommodation we are to travel out of the track of the enemy and stop at some little village until columbia is out of danger or until it is decided where the nitre bureau will be located we will carry bedding and impress provisions at government prices for the bureau this will be quite an expedition but i so dread leaving home for i feel i would never see it again except in ashes how one grows accustomed to things a year ago all this would have made me half crazy with anxiety and excitement now it seems natural we are prepared for the worst and dare not look even into the immediate future i cannot even attempt to picture to myself what may happen in the next six weeks or what may be the fate of our dear beautiful old columbia at church this afternoon dr palmer said that an ambulance train was to be sent to branchville and necessary supplies for the wounded were solicited from the ladies i stopped at aunt josie's coming back to see how johnnie got on with the measles and found him up uncle john says in a day or two the town will be flooded with the wounded that there will not be sufficient hospital accommodation and that private houses will have to be opened to receive them alas the horrors of war are coming home to us now our college hospital has indeed always been full and the disabled limping soldier has grown to be as familiar as was formerly the festive student in these classic grounds but we have never yet been literally surrounded by the wounded the dead and dying sometimes i still try to get away from the horrid present by forgetting myself in a book i have been reading just now hitchcocks religion and geology i find a good many ideas there that m in our talks advanced as his own sometimes expressed in the identical words i think he had very recently read the book by the way m young mr memminger left columbia the other day it is not likely we will ever be thrown together again well i had a very pleasant time with him while he was here he is right clever has read a good deal and his wild theories and still wilder dreams amuse and entertain me 7th feb tuesday what gloomy weather it is the rain is flooding down in torrents i would not mind the pouring rain but that my imagination pictures father and the rest exposed to its fury perhaps in an open government wagon we hoped for them a little yesterday would look for them certainly tonight but that we have been so often disappointed all this continual fear and anxiety have made me realize how intensely i love my dear precious father walter has just returned from the medical board where he went to secure a sick furlough he will probably be successful the hospital is to be moved to north carolina as columbia is in danger our own movements are unsettled so altogether he prefers going home to south west georgia wed feb 8th joy joy they have come last night when i met father i think i was perfectly happy i was standing downstairs in the basement by the fire mother and i have moved down there since carrie's illness when i heard a step in the hall it is father i thought then i tried to persuade myself it was only walter then i heard someone descending the stairs i ran to the door to find my eager hope realized with a cry of joy i threw myself in father's arms and clung to him kissing him he was wet through hair and beard dripping after a few moments he went back to aunt josie's and fetched sallie over who received a glad welcome home then such talking but another time i will try to give some account of their adventures about ten o'clock this morning walter having just left us i went over to aunt josie's to see aunt jane and cousin ada feb 9th i went to aunt josie's to return a glove pattern and to carry over some of aunt jane's things that were with sallie's found them all well father is not well however his return to the house after his open air life has given him a severe cold he and mother agree to let me teach sallie both that she may be studying and that i may learn to teach saturday feb 11th i hardly know where to begin my journal of yesterday so many things happened to begin with the morning while at the breakfast table peter came in from aunt josie's to tell us that jule and cousin johnnie had just arrived imagine our surprise shortly afterwards father received an order from richmond to pack up and move the laboratory to athens ga for awhile we of course supposed we would go also even now it still seems probable so here was abundant subject for thought and talk to think that we should really have to set to work immediately to pack up and leave home was enough to keep our brain active returning from my french lesson i stopped at aunt josie's to find her half crazy with delight at having jule again and aunt jane equally happy but not quite so overcome while both boys looked as large and natural as life they had burst into the house about 8 a.m without a word of warning fancy aunt josie's joy at seeing her soldier boy after more than a year's absence during which time his life has been constantly exposed julian is not quite so stout as he was a year ago last christmas his beard is quite formidable and altogether he is a very handsome soldier cousin johnny is somewhat changed but looks well their battery is to remain here for the present to be mounted and then to join hampton father telegraphed col st john to know if he must accompany the laboratory to athens he has not yet received an answer but since he is consulting chemist he will probably be kept on the line of telegraph the two laboratories being consolidated under pratt still he may be ordered to ga it is very hard for me to think of leaving home yet the town is in such danger and we feel so restless 12th or 13th feb father brought in some news this morning first and worst the yankees are skirmishing at orangeburg second and more encouraging gen hampton says sherman will not come to columbia at all events we certainly will know in a day or two what he is going to do mr walker has been taking steps toward boxing up and sending off the library but the governor does not think he can obtain transportation for such a large collection of books feb 14th tuesday what a panic the whole town is in i have not been out of the house myself but father says the intensest excitement prevails on the streets the yankees are reported a few miles off on the other side of the river how strong no one seems to know it is decided if this be true that we will remain quietly here father alone leaving it is thought columbia can hardly be taken by a raid as we have the whole of butler's cavalry here and if they do we have to take the consequences it is true some think sherman will burn the town but we can hardly believe that besides these buildings though they are state property yet the fact that they are used as a hospital will it is thought protect them i have been hastily making large pockets to wear under my hoopskirt for they will hardly search our persons still everything of any value is to be packed up to go with father i do not feel half so frightened as i thought i would perhaps because i cannot realize they are coming i hope still this is a false report maggie adams and her husband have promised to stay here during father's absence she is a yankee and may be some protection and help our sufferings will probably be of short duration as they will hardly send more than a raid they would not have time to occupy the town but i cannot believe they are coming aunt josie and all will remain i suppose indeed they would not have time now to put into execution their projected flight alas what may we not have gone through with by the end of this week ah me i look forward with terror and yet with a kind of callousness to their approach night father says the above is a false alarm it was only a raid of 300 men which was repulsed by our forces the evil day is at least postponed wednesday feb 15th oh how is it possible to write amid this excitement and confusion we are too far off to hear and see much down here in the campus but they tell me the streets in town are lined with panic stricken crowds trying to escape all is confusion and turmoil the government is rapidly moving off stores all day the trains have been running whistles blowing and wagons rattling through the streets all day we have been listening to the booming of cannon receiving conflicting rumors of the fighting all day wagons and ambulances have been bringing in the wounded over the muddy streets and through the drizzling rain with the dark gloomy clouds overhead all day in our own household has confusion reigned too the back parlor strewed with clothing etc open trunks standing about while a general feeling of misery and tension pervaded the atmosphere everything is to go that can be sent houselinen blankets clothing silver jewelry even the wine everything movable of any value hospital flags have been erected at the different gates of the campus we hope the fact of our living within the walls may be some protection to us but i fear not i feel sure these buildings will be destroyed i wish mother could have sent some furniture to different friends in town but it is too late now aunt josie has sent her pictures uncle john's manuscripts and some clothing to the roman catholic priest's house on main st aunt jane was here a few moments ago and advised mother as to what things she had better send off she says aunt josie is in a dreadful state of excitement neither mother nor i are much alarmed though poor sallie is very much frightened and has been crying hysterically all the morning i have destroyed most of my papers but have a lot of letters still that i do not wish to burn and yet i do not care to have them share the fate of aunt jane's and cousin ada's in liberty co which were read and scattered along the roads i will try to hide them one of my bags is filled the other i will pack tonight henry will stay with us and vows he will stand by us through thick and thin i believe he means it but do not know how he will hold on it is so cold and we have no wood the country people will not venture in town lest their horses should be impressed so we sit shivering and trying to coax a handful of wet pine to burn yonder come more wounded poor fellows indeed i can write no more night nearer and nearer clearer and more distinctly sound the cannon oh it is heart sickening to listen to it for two or three hours after dinner the cannonade ceased but for a half an hour past the same sounds with the roar of musketry break upon us frightfully near and sounding above the din of a tumultuous town and above the rattling carts just now as i stood on the piazza listening the reports sounded so frightfully loud and near that i could not help shuddering at each one and yet there is something exciting sublime in a cannonade but the horrible uncertainty of what is before us my great fear now is for father oh if he were only gone were only safe the alarm bell is ringing just now when i first heard it clang out my heart gave a leap and i thought at once it is the yankees so nervous have i grown that the slightest unusual sound startles me of course i knew it was a fire yet it was with a beating heart i threw open the window to see the western horizon lit up with the glow of flames although we are composed our souls are sick with anxiety oh if father were only safely off i try to be hopeful but if it is true as it is said that this is one of sherman's army corps what resistance can our handful of troops make oh if cheatham's corps would only come beauregard said he was expecting it in 13 hours and that was about 2 p.m they should therefore be here early tomorrow morning will they come oh if columbia could only be saved they surely ought not to give it up without a struggle later they have passed our first line of breastworks no firing tonight father and uncle john leave tonight or tomorrow morning thursday 16th feb how can the terror and excitement of today be described i feel a little quieter now and seize the opportunity to write a few lines last night or rather early this morning father left after the last lines in my entry last evening i went downstairs and found in the back parlor with father a man calling himself davis i had heard father speak of him before he met him in georgia while making his way back home with sallie and he was very kind to them during that difficult journey he calls himself a confederate spy or scout and is an oddity i only half trust him he evidently is not what he pretends to be he says he is a kentuckian and is both coarse and uneducated but wonderfully keen and penetrating he talked a great deal and entertained us by reading our different characters for us he has taken an unaccountable fancy to our father as shown by his hunting him up and he assures him again and again that he will have us protected during the presence of the yankees here he claims great influence with the yankee officers and entire knowledge of the enemy's movements all the evening he seemed exceedingly uneasy that father should so long have deferred his departure and very impatient to get him off he offered to lend him a horse if that would facilitate his leaving father is not uneasy for our authorities assure him that all is right but i do not like this man's evident anxiety can he know more than the generals about half past twelve father took leave of us thus to part father starting on an uncertain journey not knowing whether he may not be captured in his flight and leaving us to the mercy of the inhuman beastly yankees i think it was the saddest moment of my life of course father feels very anxious about us and the last words the man davis said to him were to assure him that he might feel easy about us i wonder if there is any confidence to be put in what he says hardly i suppose we said goodbye with heavy hearts and with many presentiments of evil after father was gone i sat up still talking with davis i could not sleep and besides i wanted to hear that father was safely off we asked our guest how he thought columbia would be treated he said he would not tell us it would alarm us too much does he really know all he pretends or is he only guessing it was three o'clock before i lay down and fell into a disturbed doze which lasted till seven davis stayed and slept on the ground floor but was gone before we awoke the breakfast hour passed in comparative calm about nine o'clock we were sitting in the dining room having just returned from the piazza where we had been watching a brigade of cavalry passing to the front wouldn't it be dreadful if they should shell the city someone said they would not do that replied mother for they have not demanded its surrender scarcely had the words passed her lips when jane the nurse rushed in crying out that they were shelling we ran to the front door just in time to hear a shell go whirring past it fell and exploded not far off this was so unexpected i do not know why but in all my list of anticipated horrors i somehow had not thought of a bombardment if i had only looked for it i wouldn't have been so frightened as it was for a few minutes i leaned against the door fairly shivering partly with cold but chiefly from nervous excitement after listening to them awhile this wore off and i became accustomed to the shells indeed we were in no immediate danger for the shells were thrown principally higher up they were shelling the town from the lexington heights just over the river and from the campus gate their troops could be seen drawn up on the hill tops up the street this morning the government stores were thrown open to the people and there was a general scramble our negroes were up there until frightened home by the shells the shelling was discontinued for an hour or two and then renewed with so much fury that we unanimously resolved to adjourn to the basement and abandon the upper rooms sallie and i went up to our rooms to bring down our things i was standing at my bureau with my arms full when i heard a loud report the shell whistled right over my head and exploded i stood breathless really expecting to see it fall in the room when it had passed i went into the hall and met sallie coming from her room pale and trembling o emma she said this is dreadful we went downstairs mother stood in the hall looking very much frightened did you hear yes indeed and at that instant another whistled close overhead this was growing rather unpleasant and we retreated to the basement without farther delay where we sat listening as they fell now nearer and now farther off sallie suffered most she would not be left alone and would not allow me to go to the outer door to look about but would call me back in terror the firing ceased about dinner time but as may be imagined none of us could eat during the afternoon a rapid cannonade was kept up and i do not think the forces could have been more than half a mile from here dr thomson says they are only skirmishing davis says we have received re inforcements but he thinks we cannot hold the town as we have given up the strongest position he was here this morning during the shelling and stood talking to me in the dining room for some time giving me a picture of the confusion up town our soldiers had opened and plundered some of the stores he brought me a present of a box of fancy feathers and one or two other little things he had picked up he says the bridge will be burned and the town evacuated tonight 10 o'clock p.m they are in bed sleeping or trying to sleep i don't think i shall attempt it davis was here just now to tell us the news it is kind of him to come so often to keep us posted i went up to see him made henry light the gas and sat talking to him in the hall while through the open door came the shouts of the soldiery drawn up along the streets ready to march out perhaps the yankees may be in tonight yet i do not feel as frightened as i thought i would dr thomson re assures us he does not think we shall suffer half as much as we imagine maggie is not coming we three will have to tough it out alone we have moved into the back basement room i opened the door which gives from our present sleeping room on the back yard just now and the atmosphere was stifling with gun powder smoke after i left davis and came downstairs awhile ago the gas went out so i am writing now by the firelight i suppose it will be several days before we see gas again fortunately mother has a few candles henry had to cut down a tree on the yard today for fuel but i must put by my pencil for tonight i wonder what another day's entry will be friday 17th feb how long is this distress of mind to continue it is now about eleven o'clock and the longest morning i ever lived through i threw myself on the bed late last night or rather early this morning without undressing feeling if i did not take some rest i would be sick i lay awake a long time in spite of heavy eyelids listening to the occasional cannon reports wondering if the shelling would be renewed and thinking of the tumult there was reigning uptown at last i fell into a heavy sleep at about six o'clock while it was still quite dark and all in the room were buried in profound slumber we were suddenly awakened by a terrific explosion the house shook broken window panes clattered down and we all sat up in bed for a few seconds mute with terror my first impression on waking was that a shell had struck the house but as soon as i could collect my senses i know that no shell could make such a noise we lit the candle and mother sent jane to inquire of henry the cause of course he did not know i went out of doors the day was beginning to break murkily and the air was still heavy with smoke all continuing quiet we concluded that the authorities had blown up some stores before evacuating whatever the cause the effect was to scare us very effectively and to drive away all thought of sleep we got up an hour later almost fainting for we had eaten almost nothing the preceeding day i forced myself to eat a little and to drink a half cup of coffee after breakfast the cannon opened again and so near that every report shook the house i think it must have been a cannonade to cover our retreat it did not continue very long the negroes all went uptown to see what they could get in the general pillage for all the shops had been opened and provisions were scattered in all directions henry says that in some parts of main street corn and flour and sugar cover the ground an hour or two ago they came running back declaring the yankees were in town and that our troops were fighting them in the streets this was not true for at that time every soldier nearly had left town but we did not know it then i had been feeling wretchedly faint and nauseated with every mouthful of food i swallowed and now i trembled all over and thought i should faint i knew this would not do so i lay down awhile and by dint of a little determination got quiet again mother is downright sick she had been quite collected and calm until this news but now she suddenly lost all self control and exhibited the most lively terror indeed i thought she would grow hysterical as for sallie her fright may be more easily imagined than described this condition of affairs only lasted about half an hour but it was dreadful while it did last as soon as i could i put on my pocket and nerved myself to meet them but by and by the firing ceased and all was quiet again it was denied that the yankees had yet crossed the river or even completed their pontoon bridge and most of the servants returned uptown they have brought back a considerable quantity of provisions the negroes are very kind and faithful they have supplied us with meat and jane brought mother some rice and crushed sugar for carrie knowing that she had none how times change those whom we have so long fed and cared for now help us we are intensely eager for every item of news but of course can only hear through the negroes a gentleman told us just now that the mayor had gone forward to surrender the town one o'clock p.m well they are here i was sitting in the back parlor when i heard the shouting of the troops i was at the front door in a moment jane came running and crying o miss emma they've come at last she said they were then marching down main street before them flying a panic stricken crowd of women and children who seemed crazy as she came along by aunt josie's miss mary was at the gate about to run out for god's sake miss mary she cried stay where you are i suppose she miss m thought of running to the convent i ran upstairs to my bedroom windows just in time to see the u.s flag run up over the state house o what a horrid sight what a degradation after four long bitter years of bloodshed and hatred now to float there at last that hateful symbol of despotism i do not think i could possibly describe my feelings i know i could not look at it i left the window and went back downstairs to mother in a little while a guard arrived to protect the hospital they have already fixed a shelter of boards near against the wall near the gate sentinels are stationed and they are cooking their dinner the wind is very high today and blows their hats around this is the first sight we have had of these fiends except as prisoners the sight does not stir up very pleasant feelings in our hearts we cannot look at them with anything but horror and hatred loathing and disgust the troops now in town is a brigade commanded by col stone everything is quiet and orderly guards have been placed to protect houses and sherman has promised not to disturb private property how relieved and thankful we feel after all our anxiety and distress later gen sherman has assured the mayor that he and all the citizens may sleep securely and quietly tonight as if under confederate rule private property shall be carefully respected some public buildings have to be destroyed but he will wait until tomorrow when the wind shall have entirely subsided it is said that one or two stragglers from wheeler's command fired on the flag as it was borne down main street on the carriage containing the mayor col stone and officers saturday afternoon feb 18th what a night of horror misery and agony it is useless to try to put on paper any idea of it the recollection is so fearful yet any attempt to describe it seems so useless it even makes one sick to think of writing down such scenes and yet as i have written thus far i ought while it is still fresh try even imperfectly to give some account of last night every incident is now so vividly before me and yet it does not seem real rather like a fearful dream or nightmare that still oppresses until dinner time we saw little of the yankees except the guard about the campus and the officers and men galloping up and down the street it is true as i have since learned that as soon as the bulk of the army entered the work of pillage began but we are so far off and so secluded from the rest of town that we were happily ignorant of it all i do not know exactly when sherman but i should judge about two or between one and two p.m we could hear their shouts as they surged down main street and through the state house but were too far off to see much of the tumult nor did we dream what a scene of pillage and terror was being enacted i hear they found a picture of president davis in the capitol which was set up as a target and shot at amid the jeers of the soldiery from three o'clock till seven their army was passing down the street by the campus to encamp back of us in the woods two corps entered town howard's and logan's one the diabolical 15th which sherman has hitherto never permitted to enter a city on account of their vile and desperate character slocum's corps remained over the river and i suppose davis also the devils as they marched past looked strong and well clad in dark dirty looking blue the wagon trains were immense night drew on of course we did not expect to sleep but we looked forward to a tolerably tranquil night strange as it may seem we were actually idiotic enough to believe sherman would keep his word a yankee and sherman it does seem incredible such credulity but i suppose we were so anxious to believe him the lying fiend i hope retributive justice will find him out one day at about seven o'clock i was standing on the back piazza in the third story before me the whole southern horizon was lit up by camp fires which dotted the woods on one side the sky was illuminated by the burning of gen hampton's residence a few miles off in the country on the other side by some blazing buildings near the river i had scarecely gone down stairs again when henry told me there was a fire on main street sumter street was brightly lighted by a burning house so near our piazza that we could feel the heat by the red glare we could watch the wretches walking generally staggering back and forth from the camp to the town shouting hurrahing cursing south carolina swearing blashpheming singing ribald songs and using obscene language that we were forced to go indoors the fire on main street was now raging and we anxiously watched its progress from the upper front windows in a little while however the flames broke forth in every direction the drunken devils roamed about setting fire to every house the flames seemed likely to spare they were fully equipped for the noble work they had in hand each soldier was furnished with combustibles compactly put up they would enter houses and in the presence of helpless women and children pour turpentine on the beds and set them on fire guards were rarely of any assistance most generally they assisted in the pillaging and firing the wretched people rushing from their burning homes were not allowed to keep even the few necessaries they gathered up in their flight even blankets and food were taken from them and destroyed the firemen attempted to use their engines but the hose was cut to pieces and their lives threatened the wind blew a fearful gale wafting the flames from house to house with frightful rapidity by midnight the whole town except the outskirts was wrapped in one huge blaze still the flames had not approached sufficiently near us to threaten our immediate safety and for some reason not a single yankee soldier had entered our house and now the fire instead of approaching us seemed to recede henry said the danger was over and sick of the dreadful scene worn out with fatigue and excitement we went downstairs to our room and tried to rest i fell into a heavy kind of stupor from which i was presently roused by the bustle about me our neighbor mrs caldwell and her two sisters stood before the fire wrapped in blankets and weeping their home was on fire and the great sea of flame had again swept down our way to the very campus walls i felt a kind of sickening despair and did not even stir to go and look out after awhile jane came in to say that aunt josie's house was in flames then we all went to the front door my god what a scene it was about four o'clock and the state house was one grand conflagration imagine night turned into noonday only with a blazing scorching glare that was horrible a copper colored sky across which swept columns of black rolling smoke glittering with sparks and flying embers while all around us were falling thickly showers of burning flakes everywhere the palpitating blaze walling the streets with solid masses of flames as far as the eye could reach filling the air with its horrible roar on every side the crackling and devouring fire while every instant came the crashing of timbers and the thunder of falling buildings a quivering molten ocean seemed to fill the air and sky the library building opposite us seemed framed by the gushing flames and smoke while through the windows gleamed the liquid fire this we thought must be aunt josie's house it was the next one for although hers caught frequently it was saved the college buildings caught all along that dise and had the incendiary work continued one half hour longer than it did they must have gone all the physicians and nurses were on the roof trying to save the buildings and the poor wounded inmates left to themselves such as could crawled out while those who could not move waited to be burned to death the common opposite the gate was crowded with homeless women and children a few wrapped in blankets and many shivering in the night air such a scene as this with the drunken fiendish soldiery in their dark uniforms infuriated cursing screaming exulting in their work came nearer realizing the material ideal of hell than anything i ever expect to see again they call themselves sherman's hellhounds mother collected together some bedding clothing and food which henry carried to the back of the garden and covered them with a hastily ripped up carpet to protect them from the sparks and flakes of fire he wroked so hard so faithfully and tried to comfort mother as best he could while she was sobbing and crying at the thought of being left shelterless with a delicate baby while this was going on i stood with mary ann at the kitchen door she tried to speak hopefully i could not cry it was too horrible yet i felt the house must burn by what miracle it was saved i cannot think no effort could be made no one was on the roof which was old and dry and all the while the sparks and burning timbers were flying over it like rain when the few things she tried to save were moved mother took up little carrie who was sleeping unconsciously and wrapping ourselves in shawls and blankets we went to the front door and waited for the house to catch there we stood watching and listening to the roaring and crashing it seemed inevitable they said they would not leave a house and what would become of us i suppose we owe our final escape to the presence of the yankee wounded in the hospital when all seemed in vain dr thomson went to an officer and asked if he would see his own soldiers burnt alive he said he would save the hospital and he and his men came to dr t's assistance then too about this time even the yankees seemed to have grown weary of their horrible work the signal for the cessation of the fire a blast on the bugle was given and in fifteen minutes the flames ceased to spread by seven o'clock the last flame had expired about six o'clock a crowd of drunken soldiers assaulted the campus gate and threatened to overpower the guard swearing the buildings should not be spared by great exertions dr thomson found sherman and secured a strong guard in time to rescue the hospital mrs c who had been to see after her house now returned and sitting down sobbed convulsively as she told us of the insults she had received from the soldiery engaged in pillaging her home an officer riding by ordered the men to stop so broken down and humbled by the terrible experience of the night was she that she cried out o sir please make them stop you don't know what i suffered this night i don't give a damn for your suffering he replied but my men have no right to pillage against orders fortunately oh so fortunately for us the hospital is so strictly guarded that we are unmolested within the walls o that long twelve hours never surely again will i live through such a night of horrors the memory of it will haunt me as long as i shall live it seemed as if the day would never come the sun rose at last dim and red through the thick murky atmosphere it set last night on a beautiful town full of women and children it shone dully down this morning on smoking ruins and abject misery i do not know how the others felt after the strain of the fearful excitement but i seemed to sink into a dull apathy we none seemed to have the energy to talk after awhile breakfast came a sort of mockery for no one could eat after taking a cup of coffee and bathing my face begrimed with smoke i felt better and the memory of the night seemed like a frightful dream i have scarcely slept for three nights yet my eyes are not heavy during the forenoon aunt josie and aunt jane came over to see how we had fared we met as after a long seperation and for some seconds no one could speak then we exchanged experiences they were nearer the flames than we but they had dr carter with them someone to look to and to help them aunt josie says the northern side of their house became so heated that no one could remain on that side of the house and it caught fire three times being outside the hospital buildings they were more exposed than we once a number of yankees rushed in saying the roof was on fire andrew the negro boy followed them up saw them tear up the tin roofing and place lighted combustibles and after they went down he succeeded in extinguishing the flames a tolerably faithful guard was some protection to them the view from their attic windows commands the whole town and aunt josie said it was like one surging ocean of flame she thought with us that it was more like the mediaeval pictures of hell than anything she had ever imagined we do not know the extent of the destruction but we are told that the greater portion of the town is in ashes perhaps the loveliest town in all our southern country this is civilized warfare this is the way in which the cultured yankee nation wars upon women and children failing with our men in the field this is the way they must conquer i suppose there was scarcely an able bodied man except the hospital physicians in the whole twenty thousand people it is so easy to burn the homes over the heads of the helpless women and children and turn them with insults and sneers into the streets one expects these people to lie and steal but it does seem such an outrage even upon degraded humanity that those who practise such wanton and useless cruelty should call themselves men it seems to us even a contamination to look at these devils think of the degradation of being conquered and ruled by such a people it seems to me now as if we would choose extermination i have only had to speak once to one of the blue coated fiends i went to the front door to bid francena and nellie c goodbye early this morning when a soldier came up the steps and asked me who was the mayor dr goodwyn i answered shortly and turned away do you know his initials no and i shut the door quickly behind me the state house of course is burned and they talk of blowing up the new uncompleted granite one but i do not know if it can be done in its unfinished unroofed condition we dread tonight mother asked dr thomson who has been very kind about coming in and in keeping us posted for a guard but he says it is unnecessary as double guards will be placed throughout the city dr t says some of the officers feel very much ashamed of last night's work their compunctions must have visited them since daylight the men openly acknowledged that they received orders to burn and plunder before they crossed the river the drunken scoundrels who tried to force their way into the campus this morning have been under guard at the gate several hundred of them fighting and quarrelling among themselves for sever hours poor father what will be his state of mind when he hears of all this the first reports that reach him will be even exaggerated it is some comfort to us in our uncertainty and anxiety to hope that he may be safe the explosion last night was accidental blowing up of the charleston freight depot there had been powder stored there and it was scattered thickly over the floor the poor people and negroes went in with torches to search for provisions when will these yankees go that we may breathe freely again the past three days are more like three weeks and yet when they are gone we may be worse off with the whole country laid waste and the railroads out in every direction starvation seems to stare us in the face our two families have between them a few bushels of corn and a little musty flour we have no meat but the negroes give us a little bacon every day 8 p.m there has been no firing as yet all is comparatively quiet these buildings are surrounded by a heavy guard and we are told they are distributed throughout the city all day the devils have been completing their work of plunder but in the hospital here we have been exempt from this when i remember how blest we have been i cannot be too thankful we have the promise of a quiet night but i dare not trust our hopes there is no telling what diabolical intentions they may have o if they were only gone even to the last straggler what a load would be lifted from our hearts we are anxious to learn the fate of our friends but the little we can gather except from aunt josie and mrs green is through the negroes and ours scarcely dare venture uptown the yankees plunder the negroes as well as the whites and i think they are becoming somewhat disgusted with their friends although the servants seem quite willing it is difficult to get any work out of them on account of the wild excitement ah the dreadful excitement i seem to stand it very well but it seems to me we must all be ill when it is over anxiety distress want of rest and food must tell upon us mrs wilson mr shand's daughter with a babe one week old was moved last night from her father's burning house the burroughs escaped with only the clothing they wore many many fared similarly some tried to save a little food even this was torn from their hands i have heard a number of distressing incidents but have not time to write them down o the sorrow and misery of this unhappy town from what i can hear their chief aim while taunting helpless women has been to humble their pride southern pride where now they would say is all your pride see what we have brought you to this is what you get for setting yourselves up as better than other folks the women acted with quiet dignity and refused to lower themselves by any retort someone told me the following some soldiers were pillaging the house of a lady one asked her if they had not humbled her pride now no indeed she said nor can you ever you fear us anyway no she said by g but you shall fear me and he cocked his pistol and put it to her head are you afraid now she folded her arms and looking him steadily in the eye said contemptuously no he dropped his pistol and with an exclamation of admiration left her sunday feb 19th the day has passed quietly as regards the yankees about eleven o'clock last night as everything seemed quiet and henry intended to sit up i thought i would follow mother's example and get some rest so without taking off my clothes only loosening them i lay down and slept soundly all night i woke at seven much refreshed sallie in a few moments opened her eyes and said o mother is it already day i am so glad i thought the light in the window was the reflection from a fire i rose took off my clothes for the first time in three days and after bathing and putting on clean clothes felt like another being this morning fresh trouble awaited us we thought the negroes were going to leave us while we were on the back piazza mary ann came to us weeping and saying she feared the yankees were going to force henry to go off with them and of course she would have to go with her husband he did not want to go and would not unless forced she seemed greatly distressed at the thought of leaving the master and mistress who had supplied the place of father and mother to her an orphan the others maria and her children want to go i think they have been dressed in their sundays best all day mary ann when she came to get dinner said she could cook two more meals for us anyway mother went over to aunt josie's to consult her she advised that if they left mother should get dr thomson to put some sick men in our house to protect it and we must all move over there as she has two white servants on her return however she talked to henry who vows he will never leave us unless dragged away and he thinks he can avoid them they are free however at present and we ask as little as possible of them such as cooking our little food and bringing water from the well the water works being destroyed we have to get water from the campus well if jane offers to clean up our room all very well if not we do it ourselves this afternoon i washed the dinner things and put the room to rights the house is untouched except this one room we live in which i manage to keep neat and clean this is my first experience in work of this kind and i find it is better than doing nothing the negroes when we ask however seem quite willing and have given us not the slightest impertinence while mother was at aunt josie's i took carrie up in the drawing room to amuse her while we stood by the front window the house was shaken by a terrible explosion as the gas works were burning at the time i concluded it was the gasometer but remembering we had had no gas for two or three days that seemed impossible henry has just explained it our men had buried a number of shells near the river an attempt was made to excavate them and one going off accidentally exploded the rest killing wounding a great many yankees how i rejoice to think of any of them being killed dr bell says about 200 were burnt up friday night drunk perhaps if only the whole army could have been roasted alive the provost guard is encamped opposite the campus it consists of one battalion and is to remain until the last straggler leaves town two of the officers went to aunt josie's and saying they wished quarters opposite their camp she was obliged to accommodate them and give up her library for their use their horrid old gridiron of a flag is flaunting its bars in our faces all day ever since dark thick clouds of smoke have been rolling up from the arsenal and i fear the flames will spread over the hill mary ann came to see us in great distress this afternoon to tell us that a yankee had sworn to her that these buildings should be burned tonight enquiring of an officer mother was assured there was no danger i suppose it was only a drunken threat mother looked over the town this morning from aunt josie's attic window she described a scene of fearful desolation here all is hidden from us when they are gone i will walk out of the campus and see it all yet how i dread it poor columbia sometimes i try to picture it to myself as it now is but i cannot i always see the leafy streets and lovely gardens the familiar houses i cannot imagine the ruins and ashes to save my life how i hate the people who have done this a few moments ago there was a violent ring the the bell i was the only person awake and i roused jane up and sent her upstairs it was some yankee officers who wished to know where mayor goodwyn lived sherman it seems wished to appoint a meeting with him in order to leave arms for the citizens to protect them from stragglers monday feb 20th quite early this morning a yankee entered the yard looking for henry who forthwith locked himself in his room mother went out and asked the mean filthy devil if he wished to make henry go against his will he hesitated a little and said no but he wished to see him the soldier the dirtiest meanest looking creature imaginable told mother when she threatened to send for the guard if he did not leave that he was one of the guard himself well said mother there are two officers at my sister's house and i will send to them the yankee turned and left the yard mrs bell tells us that sherman turned loose upon us a brigade that he had never allowed to enter any other city on account of their desperate and villainous character and yet they talk now of being ashamed of what followed and try to lay it on the whiskey they found shortly after breakfast o joyful sight the two corps encamped behind the campus back of us marched by with all their immense wagon trains on their way from columbia they tell us all will be gone by tomorrow evening o that we were completely rid of them and that father were with us i might then know what it is to feel happy one moment under other circumstances it would have been a wonderful sight to see this great army with its endless trains march by with the memory of friday night burned in it was hard to look at them a great drove of lean ill looking cattle was driven into the campus today our two cows have not been taken from us neither the roman catholic trinity episcopal or presbyterian churches were burnt it was a miracle the latter was saved everything around it was destroyed in trinity churchyard soldiers were encamped of course there was no service in any of the churches yesterday no church bells ringing the yankees riding up and down the streets the provost guard putting up their camp there was nothing to suggest sunday what balmy delicious weather we have had for three days past most fortunate it is or there would have been even more suffering henry has already cut down two trees in the yard to give us fuel mother has just this moment returned from aunt josie's bringing the news that the last of the army is leaving the city the provost guard has broken up camp also this leaves the terror of stragglers before us we expected the guard would remain a day or two there is no knowing what outrages may be committed mother is going to try to get mr thomson to stay here at night she wants to send me to aunt josie's but i will not leave her alone we must trust to henry's protection tuesday 21st the night with its fear of stragglers is past and we may breathe more freely but not less sadly the destruction and desolation around us which we could not feel while under such excitement and fear now exerts its full sway sad the very air is fraught with sadness and silence the few noises that break the stillness seem melancholy and the sun does not seem to shine as brightly seeming to be dimmed by the sight of so much misery i was at aunt josie's this morning and there learned for the first time the extent of suffering o god when we think of what we have escaped and how almost miraculously we have been saved we should never rise from our knees there is not a house i believe in columbia that has not been pillaged those that the flames spared were entered by brutal soldiery and everything wantonly destroyed the streets were filled with terrified women and children who were offered every insult and indignity short of personal outrage they were allowed to save nothing but what clothes they wore and there is now great suffering for food it would be impossible to describe or even to conceive the pandemonium and horror there is no shadow of doubt that the town was burned by sherman's order all through georgia it is said he promised his men full license in south carolina the signals both for firing and ceasing were given the soldiers were provided with the materials for the work and yet i hear that he already denies it and tries to put the responsibility on gen hampton at one time friday night when aunt josie's house and other buildings were taking fire the college buildings were given up and the poor wounded soldiers who could not be moved resigned themselves to death dr carter says it was a touching sight to see the poor fellows trying manfully to nerve themselves to meet their fate and there was the regiment ostensible sent to extinguish the fire calmly looking on without raising a finger and the patriots on the streets themselves applying the torch the hospital was saved by one yankee captain and two men yet it contained many of their own wounded soldiers the unfinished granite state house was not blown up because they were short of powder and it is unroofed all that could be destroyed was ruined by the burning of the work sheds fine carving capitals columns ornamental work etc i can hardly help feeling that our total exemption from insult and plunder was due in some way to the influence of the strange man who called himself davis and promised us protection why in many houses the very guards stationed to protect helped the soldiers in smashing and destroying it is sickening to listen to the tale of distress much more to try to write of it a heavy curse has fallen on this town from a beautiful bustling city it is turned into a desert how desolate and dreary we feel how completely cut off from the world no longer the shrill whistle of engine no daily mail the morning brings no paper with news from outside there are no lights no going to and fro it is as if a city in the midst of business and activity were suddenly smitten with some appalling curse one feels awed if by chance the dreary stillness is broken by a laugh or too loud a voice how unhappy poor father and uncle john julian and cousin johnny will be when they hear of this there has even been a report afloat that aunt josie's house was burned and cousin lula perished in the flames if they should hear that i wonder if the vengeance of heaven will not pursue such fiends before they came here i thought i hated them as much as was possible now i know there are no limits to the feeling of hatred wed feb 22nd i meant last night to write down some description of what i had seen but was too wretchedly depressed and miserable to even think of it this morning we have heard that he is safe and i can take up my journal again yesterday afternoon we walked all over the town in company with miss ellen labordo yes i have seen it all i have seen the abomination of desolation it is even worse than i thought the place is literally in ruins the entire heart of the city is in ashes only the outer edges remain on the whole length of sumter street not one house beyond the first block after the campus is standing except the brick house of mr mordecai standing in the centre of the town as far as the eye can reach nothing is to be seen but heaps of rubbish tall dreary chimneys and shattered brick walls while in the hollow windows dreary horror's sitting poor old columbia where is all her beauty so admired by strangers so loved by her children she can only excite the pity of the former and the tears of the latter i hear several yankee officers remarked to some citizens on the loveliness of their town as they first saw it by sunrise across the river blanding street crossing main and sumter at right angles the finest street in town is also a sad picture the preston house with its whole square of beautiful gardens escaped it was gen logan's headquarters the crawford house the bryce's the howe's and one or two others also escaped all nearer main street were burned the clarkson house is a heap of brick with most of its tall columns standing blackened by the smoke bedell's lovely little house is in ruins while as if in mockery the shrubbery is not even scorched but i cannot particularize with very few exceptions all our friends are homeless we enter main street since the war in crowd and bustle it has rivalled a city thoroughfare what desolation everything has vanished as by enchantment stores merchants customers all the eager faces gone only three or four dismal looking people to be seen picking their way over heaps of rubbish brick and timbers the wind moans among the bleak chimneys and whistles through the gaping windows of some hotel or warehouse the market a ruined shell supported by crumbling arches its spire fallen in and with it the old town clock whose familiar stroke we miss so much after trying to distinguish localities and hunting for familiar buildings we turned to arsenal hill here things looked more natural the arsenal was destroyed but comparatively few dwellings also the park and its surroundings looked familiar as we passed the old state house going back i paused to gaze on the ruins only the foundations and chimneys and to recall the brilliant scene enacted there one short month ago and i compared that scene with its beauty gayety and festivity the halls so elaborately decorated the surging throng with this i reached home sad at heart and full of all i had seen presently we heard a commotion in the yard running out on the back verandah we saw standing in the middle of the yard sandy and the boys and the negroes who had remained grouped around them as soon as they saw us annie screamed the yankees has caught em mass johnny's come back and master's took prisoner asking sandy about father he said that he and capt green were in the woods when the party was captured we could learn nothing succinct from him and all tired as we were rushed over to see johnny we found him in the kitchen with cousin lula and the two white servants all the rest were out johnny gave us a description of their capture the yankees they fell in with treated them kindly and he thought uncle john would soon be paroled he thought father must have been captured as the woods were alive with yankees he did not see how they could escape and he feared he would fare worse for trying to escape and even if he did escape the country had been so entirely swept that he could get nothing to eat father and capt green were out scouting when the wagons were taken as johnny started home yesterday and had seen father last on sunday morning there seemed little grounds to hope that he had not been taken yet if i had been certain of his capture it would have been less dreadful than the thought of his hiding in the woods cold and hungry and the possibility of being shot it was dreadful everything was burst open all our silver and valuables stolen articles of clothing slashed up by bayonets and burned with father's valuable books carried off for safety and all our table linen and bedding blankets etc but we did not once think of these things in the great anxiety and distress about father then aunt josie and aunt jane mrs green and cousin ada came in cousin lula went to break the news aunt josie was quite overcome she and mother wept together aunt jane trying to comfort them i drew back in the shadow of the staircase it seemed as if my heart would break and i cried by myself till cousin ada turning said poor emma and put her arms around me it was dark and we had to go home i rushed upstairs to my room and threw myself down beside the bed my heart was bursting one horrible picture always before my eyes this morning mother learned from moultrie gibbes that father is safe he saw him at a house 18 miles from columbia it is impossible to tell of the relief after such suspense i feel so thankful we learned from sandy that the negroes at the nitre plantation who were along have taken possession of and brought home some of our things mother and aunt josie went to capt stanley of the provost guard and he has promised to institute a thorough search for them but how could we guess that our house would not be treated like the rest luckily we did not send off our summer clothing sandy says they dived immediately into the box of wine and told him to tell his mistress they were much obliged as they swallowed hock and champagne henry says one mill has been spared and we can get corn ground the negroes are flocking in from the devastated country to be fed mayor goodwyn has ordered them to be sent back as the town is threatened with starvation indeed i do not know what will become of us unless relief comes in from edgefield or augusta in every other direction we understand the country is a desert orangeburg winnsboro chester camden all in ashes incarnate fiends and sherman o for a tongue to curse the slave february 23rd the days are now as monotonous as possible i do not leave the house yesterday except the portion spent in writing this record was spent in wandering aimlessly about the house or sitting listless in the sun this morning i felt i must not be so idle i tried to read a volume of mad de stael de la literature it was impossible i tried something lighter one of dickens i soon found i did not know what i was reading i thought of commencing a pair of gloves i have been meaning to make for father the very thought seemed to make me weary i suppose it is the reaction from the frightful strain and nervous tension the violent excitement and then the uncertainty of the future what is to become of us if father would only come home if we could only leave this desolate place sometimes i feel a restless impatience to know what is going on in the world from which we are cut off and i feel at times an entire and apathetic indifference as to what should transpire mother saw mr gibbes yesterday herself he said he was passing a house and hearing some confederate officers were within he desired to see them whereupon father and capt green made their appearance at the door the former with a cup of coffee in his hand at that time he was expecting to make his way to winnsboro but mr g told him the yankees were gone in that direction and advised him to remain where he was until he heard from columbia i looked for him last night and sometimes i fear he may have been caught by kilpatrick's raiders but i think i have no reasonable ground for such a fear there is nothing to do but try to be patient patience how the heavy days creep by o to see our dear father again after all that has been gone through and suffered since we parted dr carter left for augusta this morning and we sent letters by him to georgia i wrote a few pages to cousin ella would have written to cousin annie but do not know where she is mother wrote to grandmother i hope the letters will be legible enough when they reach their destination to relieve anxiety there is not one drop of ink in the house and for ten days i have written this diary in pencil i wish i could get letters sallie has commenced studying and will recite her lessons to me tomorrow i cannot summon energy or interest to go back to my own studies that must not be until anxiety banished we are re united and settled down in quiet when will that be the yankees talk very strongly of conquering the south immediately if so our day of rest is far off somehow i am still as confident as i ever was if only our people will be steadfast the more we suffer the more we should be willing to undergo rather than submit somehow i cannot feel we can be conquered we have lost everything but if everything negroes property all could be given back a hundredfold i would not be willing to go back to them i would rather endure any poverty than live under yankee rule i would rather far have france or any other country for a mistress anything but live as one nation with yankees that word in my mind is a synonym for all that is mean despicable and abhorrent i hope relief will come before famine actually threatens we have to cut our rations as short as possible to try to make the food hold out till succor comes father left us with some mouldy spoiled flour that was turned over to him by the bureau we can only possible eat it made into battercakes and then it is horrid we draw rations from the town every day a tiny bit of rancid salt pork and a pint of meal we have the battercakes for breakfast the bit of meat and cornbread for dinner no supper we fare better than some because we have the cows mother had peas to feed them and sometimes we take a few of those from them to vary our diet today as a great treat mother gave us boiled rice for dinner some the negroes had brought us in the pillage of the stores we enjoyed it immensely the first i have tasted in many days sunday night feb 26th at last i have something joyful to chronicle father is returned friday evening as we all sat in the library there was a knocking at the door then a violent ring at the bell we knew what it meant i rushed to the door first and opened it to fall in father's arms what a scene embraces kisses weeping he was wet through and in rags we hurried him to the fire and listened to the story of his escape an escape that seemed little short of miraculous i am so thankful and happy every moment that i remember he is safe at home father describes sherman's track up there as the same it was in the lower part of the state desolation and ruin every night the entire horizon was illuminated by burning houses poor carolina and the burning of columbia was the most diabolical act of all the barbarous war father grits his teeth every time he sees the ruins or speaks of the horrors of that night as far as i can see the people are undemoralized and more determined than ever the yankee officers while here they paid the tribute to the women of this state of saying they were the most firm obstinate and ultra rebel set of women they had encountered if the men only prove equally so father and i went to church this morning we had a mournful looking congregation dr howe officiated reading the first chapter of lamentations after church we stopped at aunt josie's who kindly lent us some table silver all mother saved was three forks two tablespoons and two teaspoons which she kept for our use today is father's birthday tuesday feb 28th i am now fairly launched as a school maam i fancy i get on pretty well considering my lack of experience i teach sallie arithmetic latin spelling and elementary natural philosophy besides reading and composition i will begin study myself when father returns from a trip down the river with capt green to get provisions for the town in general and our two families in particular they propose starting tomorrow cousin ada and i went to call on mrs carroll yesterday but found she is not in town having run away just before the advent of the yankees it is not far from her house to the cemetery so we went there to look at little josie's grave coming home we walked down main street slowly in the middle of the street for fear of falling walls trying to conjure up the well known shops and buildings from the shapeless heaps at the market place we saw the old bell secessia that had rung out every state as it seceded lying half buried in the earth and reminding me of retzsch's last outline in the song of the bell showing that all things earthly disappear we walked through the state house yard and examined the marks of the shells in the new capitol large pieces of granite are sometimes broken off on one end alone we counted places where eight shells had struck and exploded we have since heard that in the accidental explosion of the charleston freight depot from the igniting of powder strewn upon the floor 150 or 200 people were killed
wednesday march 1st the first day of spring a gloomy opening of the bright season it is not cold but dark and rainy father has been obliged to defer his trip on account of the weather and is waiting for a fair day there was a rumor afloat yesterday that a negro regiment was marching from branchville to garrison columbia heavens have we not suffered enough i do not believe it but the very thought is enough to make one shudder if father succeeds in laying in a supply of food we will probably remain here unless father is ordered away communication will soon be opened with augusta and other towns and probably with col st john as long as we stay here we have the comforts of home and are among friends then if the government works are moved back i might get some kind of employment march 2nd it still continues damp and cloudy with no immediate prospect of a favourable change i have not gone back to study but feel heartily ashamed of myself for not doing so i have resolved not to be idle any longer but to go back to my books and take up again some solid reading i had planned before all this excitement this afternoon father called me downstairs to help him rearrange the books they had been packed in boxes before the yankees came for removal but father finding it impossible to take them off judged they would be safer in the cases as the soldiers would tumble them out in search of valuables so just before he left he had henry put them back of course he placed them on the shelves pell mell without any regard to order i had a good laugh today with sallie i mentioned in my account of the shelling of the town on thursday that the man davis brought me a box of feathers i had laid them away and did not think of them till today when i came across them and we were looking over them selecting some that i thought would make a pretty fan near the bottom of the box sallie spied a folded paper a leaf from some note book she opened it at the top of the page was a rude drawing of two hearts this the note said portrayed two hearts surrounded by rosebuds the rosebuds being entirely imaginary may they continued the note prove an emblem of our hearts may they be joined by the golden links of friendship and may the rosebuds of life entwine them and though many hundred miles separate us may we be always firm friends well if that individual is not a queer fish i never met one he was pretty rough specimen but if we owe anything to his kindness of heart i ought not to be too hard on his coarseness of course sallie got a lot of fun out of it showing it in high glee to father who was greatly amused over it the fellow had remarkably keen insight into character the evening he talked with me after father was gone he hit off his character wonderfully except in one or two points remarkable considering how absolutely father differed from himself he read both mother's and my character too mine except for the flattery he threw in was very correct also tuesday march 7th last friday 3rd we received two pieces of good news in the first place dr pratt arrived with four wagons to our relief two hours after receiving father's letter he started in that short time provisions were hastily collected and clothing for father uncle john and capt green father has been wearing a pair of blue trousers taken from a dead yankee soldier at the hospital and given him by one of the doctors the officers of the nitre bureau contributed throwing in shirts collars socks etc when he got to prof holmes in edgefield that generous hearted friend set to work and loaded up a wagon with bacon corn clothing etc and sent word we must all come to his home right away such friends in times like these of scarcity and selfishness are indeed to be appreciated dr pratt left so hurriedly that he did not even go home to bid his wife goodbye only despatched her a note he says no one in augusta has the slightest conception of the desolation here they suppose that only main street was burned and that the yankees said was done accidentally by our own soldiers in destroying cotton as soon as the state of things was better understood contributions poured in our necessities are supplied for the present and we need not now draw rations from the town as we have been doing ever since the fire the mayor issues rations to 7000 people all that is left of a population of about 30,000 the original population of 12,000 was enormously increased since the war by refugees and other sources the other piece of good news was received last night that uncle john was paroled in chester aunt josie's joy was unbounded and her excitement brought on a severe attack of palpitation of the heart last evening she received a letter from him he is within 27 miles of columbia but is waiting to get a conveyance one of his feet is so sore from making a march of 50 miles with the yankees that he cannot walk it chester was not burned the yankees did not go either there or to yorkville the greater part of winnsboro was destroyed and the whole of lexington in fact every town and village in their track dr pratt stayed with us while here father giving up his expedition down the river returned with him to augusta yesterday to see what he could do about getting supplies from there we expect him back in one or two days we can hear nothing from our army for the first time we are without the excitement of daily telegraphic news and i miss the breakfast table discussions of the war news and the movements of the forces we live in absolute ignorance while our fate is being decided and speedy peace and long continued war are trembling in the balance at all events we miss perhaps a thousand unfounded and conflicting rumors we are hoping for intervention but that may mean humiliating concessions if recognition meant the opening of our ports only that would be all we would ask once freely supplied with materials for war we would soon be independent that is all we need wednesday march 8th uncle john got home last night it has been raining all day and i have not been to see him he is confined to the house with his foot i am back at my books again and read a great deal i do nothing else except of course knitting which does not interfere at all with my reading i have gone at old gibbon again and mean to finish him am also reading hitchcock especially in the metaphysical portions of the latter i need father so much i hope he will not have to go off again i do want to to get steadily and systematically at work again friday march 10th today is the day of fasting and prayer appointed by the president it rained so hard all the morning however that none of us went to church even if the weather were favorable i could not go as i am not at all well nor have been for several days but only began to feel like giving up yesterday nevertheless i went in spite of threatening clouds to see uncle john in the afternoon he had a hard time with the yankees was not allowed a blanket to sleep on no fire and had to march over a hundred miles with them he saw one of his own negroes peter on horseback while he was plodding on foot on the whole though he looks very well and feels more like himself except for his foot aunt josie was sick in bed uncle john said that while he was marching along a yankee officer rode beside him and asked what will you southerners do when we have marched victoriously through virginia and taken richmond i think gen lee may have something to say to that he replied you have him to meet yet well suppose we defeat and disperse his army i suppose then we will have to resort to guerilla warfare the officer looked surprised and shocked why cannot you yield he asked uncle john shrugged his shoulders and said we would resort to anything rather than give up well replied the yankee i hope the south won't do anything of that kind for of course in that event we would not spare or respect your women march 11th a courier last night brought the news of the fall of richmond or at least its evacuation we have heard rumors to this effect for some time so we were in a measure prepared for it it is so hard to believe people talk about its being the best move that now we will catch sherman etc etc it seems nonsense to me the fact remains that our capital the great bone of contention for which the yankees have struggled in vain for four years around which so many bloody battles have been fought has fallen at last i feel as if the end had come and utterly heartsick and yet have become so accustomed to disaster that nothing overwhelms me not even this it only somewhat deepens the gloom we can not be conquered that is unthinkable but there are bitter days and we are passing through a dark cloud sherman marched through georgia savannah fell i thought he would be opposed here the president promised to defend south carolina sherman swept on unresisted devasting burning he holds charleston has burned columbia left his whole track a smouldering desert now richmond has fallen where is a ray of hope only to gen lee and his poor little half starved army can the people look yet an army that has never suffered defeat a contrast to the western army sunday march 12th it is a calm bright spring day warm balmy and quiet the campus is quite green with the springing grass and the tall elms are budding the birds are singing again and as we walked home from church this morning we gathered blue hyacinths and yellow daffodils from among the blackened ruins spring no longer looks gay and bright as it used to in the fair town buried in trees and gardens and even where the foliage is not destroyed the bursting green will make a sad contrast with the melancholy ruins in church this morning all looked so familiar the congregation full dr palmer in his place again choir and organ that sitting there it was hard to realize all was so changed coming out the ruins all around struck afresh with strangeness and unreality we have some 120 of wheeler's cavalry here for a time but they are going to leave they were drawn up in the street this morning backs yesterday morning i spent with aunt jane who is thickly broken out with measles more consequences of walter's visit to us with them in the afternoon i went to see miss jane and miss sophia reynolds and afterwards to madame d'ovilliers nothing was talked of but that dreadful night poor little madame how she did jabber in her broken english i will try to look up my friends but many left before the surrender and most of the rest are burnt out and i do not know where to find them some among them the carrolls and bauskets went to winnsboro and met the yankees there march 14th richmond has not fallen petersburg has been given up and lee has drawn in his lines and sent 10,000 men to johnston aunt jane has heard from cousin john she has been very uneasy about him for when he came that fatal friday to tell her goodbye the yankees were only two blocks behind him at the state house he barely escaped by the fleetness of his horse but had to ride 25 miles through a deserted country to join his command and thinks he would have starved but for the large lunch aunt josie stuffed in his haversack as he left aunt josie tried to look up some of our lost clothing the authorities have taken everything stolen by the negroes or given them by the yankees and exposed them in some building for identification by owners hearing that many articles were taken from the nitre bureau negroes aunt josie went forth with high hopes but all she recovered was a portion of one of her dresses and the flounce of my green embroidered silk she and cousin lula lost even more heavily than mother and i in clothing for we only sent off our best things but they sent everything except two winter dresses apiece and hardly a change of underclothing and not an article to begin summer with our underclothing was all of homespun and our stockings home knit so we kept them the silk dresses so carefully treasured during the war are entirely irreplaceable aunt josie and cousin lula lost 24 before them how are we to get clothes when even calico is from 25 to 30 a yard there is a report in town that sherman has been killed but that is far too good to be true another report is that hampton fell in with part of his wagon train and captured the citizens who left columbia with sherman's army and recovered much silver stolen here the yankees said they had not anywhere met with such quantities of plate and valuables and plunder as they found in columbia that it seemed the richest place they had struck they told the people of cheraw which was also burned that they had treated columbia worse than they should have done but sherman told them when they crossed the river that he would not restrain them but gave them license to sack pillage and burn the capital of secession as they chose several pages missing saturday march 18th we are looking for father home now we expected him yesterday or today at last we have received some tidings from charleston some people unable any longer to endure the state of things they have found their way on foot to columbia the reign of terror they describe is unperalled even in this barberous war the city is garrisoned by negro troops who unrestrained perpetrate every barbarity until at length their outrages reached such a pitch that their officers were obliged to some extent to interfere 30 men were shot for violating women in the surrounding country affairs are even worse than in the city the slaves turned loose and wildest anarchy reigns when some of foster's negro troops arrived in georgetown the same excesses were begun there a mr middleton 80 years old was ordered by ruffians to leave his house he was alone the family being here he deprecated their cruelty urging that he was old and had never taken any part in the war they said they knew he was darned old rebel and ordered him to get out he begged for a little time to move some effects this being refused he went to his room put a few clothes in a pillowcase and taking a blanket from his bed left the house the negroes took his blanket from him he watched his burning house till it was consumed and then taking the road to columbia walked the entire distance from georgetown reaching this place a day or two ago the people are fearing that a negro garrison may be sent here if such fears should be realized we must leave if we have to walk to augusta it is rumored that the yankee gunboats are coming the river to complete their work of destruction of columbia by blowing up the state house we hear so many wild and dreadful rumors mrs bird passed through yesterday on her way from richmond to augusta she says the deepest despondency prevails there on account of the giving up of charleston and columbia and the expectation that richmond will share the same fate charlotte still holds out we know almost nothing the only reliable news from couriers and they come so rarely it is wonderful the avidity with which every scrap of news or even rumor from the outer world is seized upon in this forlorn town mr pope has just got in he says he only escaped by passing himself off as a preacher and was several times told by the yankees that they had caught tax collector pope most of them spoke exultingly of having burned columbia one only expressed regret because it was such a pretty town on his inquiring the cause of the conflagration they at first repeated the story of the whiskey but one fellow said frankly that he might as well tell the truth that sherman had ordered them to burn it that they expected to burn it and they did burn the the hole of secession mr pope says that they had not however expected to take it for beauregard had telegraphed hardee to come to his aid and that scoundrel paid no attention to the telegram mr pope says all the yankees he talked with concurred in unqualified admiration for the pluck and dignity of the columbia women through all the frightful night they did not see a tear or hear one complaint and they did not think they could ever conquer the south if the men were animated by the same spirit as the women of south carolina mr pope asked them if they thought to whip the south by marching through devastating the country unopposed except by women and children the yankees replied that they did not expect to whip our armies but meant to starve us out and can you do that he asked the yankee said sometimes i doubt it for everywhere we go we find such quantities of provisions you southerners have a rich country telegraphic communication will be opened with richmond in a few days and then i hope we will hear regularly from the armies in n carolina and virginia and also what has become of thomas we are also soon to have a tri weekly paper edited by gilmer sims and call the phoenix i had saved almost a regular file of daily papers from 1862 but in the confusion of the fire they were emptied out of the trunk scattered and destroyed mother tried to persuade me to go with her to the depot but i had no wish to see the dreadful sight the ruins are filled with the bones of the unfortunates who perished in the explosion and their mangled remains are scattered around the gas works too are destroyed beyond repair when father comes back i think i will walk down to granby and see the battle field though there is little to be seen i suppose beyond the breastworks and earth torn up and trees cut by cannon balls the last news from johnston was that he had retreated to raleigh this arch retreater will probably retreat till perhaps he retreats to gen lee who may put a stop to his retrograde movement
april 1st since my last entry on the 18th many events of importance have transpired about ten days ago father returned from augusta bringing provisions cloth leather and tallow to make some candles thus far we have had nothing but pine firelight after dark the provisions were flour corn and bacon a few hams but chiefly the sides i am so sick of bacon it seems impossible for me to eat it it seems as if i ought to when father and the rest can eat it and think it good but indeed my stomach turns against it and i usually make my dinner of hominy corn bread and butter the cloth is six bolts of factory cloth unbleached homespun which father on account of being a columbia sufferer got it at the very low price of only three dollars a yard it makes me groan in spirit to think of wearing this heavy stuff as underclothing all the hot summer but as aunt jane eagerly observes it is better than nothing indeed cousin ada and i agreed we would willingly wear sackcloth and even ashes if necessary rather than give up to the yankees with all the ports closed we will be obliged to give up every foreign luxury which are even now by their high prices beyond the reach of all but speculators as i sat with aunt jane sick with the measles we laughingly arranged it all and found we could live very well on home products our clothing is already mostly of homespun our stockings we already knit and we make our own gloves our hats we could plait from palmetto or grass and trim them in summer with natural flowers in winter with holly berries and ivy we have only a very few more things to learn in feminine dress father brought us some nice fine yarn so much pleasanter to use than the coarse stuff i got at the factory here and i am now knitting with it some beautiful stockings it would seem very strange now to put on a pair of new store stockings and i am such an accomplished knitter that i do not look at my work and so can read and study while i knit my hands are rarely without my knitting except when otherwise employed and this has been a great resource during the long evenings with the light but dim firelight father brought us also some coarse blankets the tallow mother has moulded into candles how we miss the gas the evenings are so long and dismal by the light of a tallow candle how unappreciated was this one luxury until we lost it mr stovall spent several days looking about the miserable wreck of columbia we hear all sorts of vague rumors about johnston defeating sherman but nothing definite enough to pin a hope to april 13th columbia was in quite a panic a few days ago a yankee raid was at kingsville and we feared it would shortly be here but they turned off towards camden i heard a gentleman say he thought columbia would be garrisoned this summer as a headquarters for sending out raids into the upper part of the state they say there has been a fearful battle in virginia the most fearful battle of the war that lee has lost 20,000 men and fallen back while grant has lost 50,000 we can ill afford to lostthat number of men all looks so dark and gloomy i do not despair as many do but i feel very sad and bitter when i think of the condition of our dear country the south will not give up i can not think that but i look forward to years of suffering and grief years of desolation and bloodshed they say charlotte has fallen montgomery too and selma more than all richmond all we have is those two armies brave but outnumbered if they are overthrown then follows the wearing guerilla fighting and all the atrocities and evils that come in its train i suppose the yankees are holding a great jubilee in charleston today not long ago they had a most absurd procession described in glowing colours and celebrating the death of slavery abolitionists delivered addresses on the superiority of the black race over white adam and eve were black so were cain and abel but when the former slew his brother his great fright turned him white also as christ died for the human race so john brown died for the negroes etc etc today they intended raising their wretched flag over noble old sumter and there was to be a great to do and fuss poor old sumter dear old fort what a degradation this day four long years ago the joy the excitement how well i remember it for weeks we had been in fever of excitement on the day the news came of the fall of sumter we were all sitting in the library at uncle john's the bell commenced to ring at the first tap we knew the joyful tidings had come father and uncle john made a dash for their hats jule and johnny followed we women ran trembling to the verandah to the front gate eagerly asking the news of passers by the whole town was in a joyful tumult what could now rouse us from our dull apathy unless it were the certain news of an honourable peace what changes what a lifetime we have lived in the four years past i am studying german now and am working away at the grammar and translating wilhelm tell i have long wanted to get a reading knowledge of this language and have eyed wistfully the sealed treasures of german literature in the library so my pleasure can be conceived when mrs leland offered to teach me in return for reading french with her she and i have a conversation lasson of an hour and a half with madame on mondays and thursdays at ten o'clock on wednesdays i read french with mrs leland and on tuesdays and fridays we have a german class mrs leland giving us generally two hours as she has much leisure indeed i would be sorry to leave columbia and the libraries now with these nice plans on hand april 14th i am so thankful that winter has gone finally and entirely cold weather means real suffering in many ways to us and bright spring is doubly welcome she did not come coquetting as last year but as it were rushed into our arms in the space of two weeks the trees burst into leaf so rapidly that one could almost see them unfolding by the first of april they were in full foliage those parts of town like the campus that were untouched by the fire are now lovely with the delicate green of spring among the ruins one sees long avenues of burnt and blackened trees now and then in mocking contrast one will stretch its leafy branches over a crumbling wall and sometimes half or part of a tree has struggled into leaf and the rest stands gaunt and bare christ church was one of the last buildings burned it makes a beautiful ruin especially now when through the tall gothic windows and above the pointed walls one sees the waving foliage of blanding street here in the campus nothing mars the springtime beauty it is lovely i am sitting in the front door and the afternoon is deepening into twilight the grass is fresh and green under the majestic elms whose wide spreading sweeping branches so black and fine show out in relief against the tender green of the young leafage the oaks too are all out and so thick is the mass of verdure that from my bedroom windows i cannot see across to the library building with its white columns just before me on the green lawn beneath a great elm is pitched a tent or large fly under which are lying half a dozen soldiers at a little distance two fires are burning and around them are grouped others busily engaged in preparing their evening meal these men are just from camden to them as goethe says the old story of the year is being repeated again we are come again thank god to its most charming chapter the violets and may flowers are its superscription and vignettes it always makes a pleasant impression on us when we open at these pages of the book of life we father cousin ada and i walked into the woods yesterday afternoon we found the ground fairly carpeted with violets phlox and other spring flowers we gathered large bunches of them and sat a long time on the mosses of the rocky branch just where the water makes a mimic cataract over large rocks i am always so happy when i get into the country saturday april16th went out this morning to have our feet measured for shoes oliver's shop is a genuine phoenix risen from its ashes he has built a frame building of two rooms around his old chimney coming back we passed through the state house yard picking our way over piles of rubbish on every side a wilderness of granite and marble piles on piles of white and tennessee marble blocks cracked broken and smoke begrimed many blocks are crumbling to pieces even the granite slabs are cracked and scaling from the heat of the burning workshops and sheds hundreds of sculptured capitals lie broken and defaced in the midst rises the half finished capital seeming to look mournfully down on the destruction that surrounds it in a remote part of the grounds behind some granite blocks lie scattered the chimes of st michael's one quite destroyed all cracked by the heat those historic bells ten in number considered the finest chime in the country they were presented from the mother country while south carolina was a colony when charles was taken by the british the bells were sent to england after the revolution some say they were returned others that they were brought back anyway they came back to charleston and for eighty years played from st michael's tower two years ago when bells were given to be moulded into cannon they were sent here either for that purpose or for safe keeping while charleston was under fire they were placed in a building on the state house grounds and here they lie now footnote added later after the war these bells were sent to england and re cast in the same foundry where they were originally made and they now hang in st michael's steeple news came today that camden was taken by the raiders so there is some chance of getting our rice after all rice stored there belonging to the nitre bureau gen lovell has been appointed to the command of the department of south carolina i hope he will infuse some spirit into our people and defend us from yankees ca april 20th armistice or truce between generals johnston and sherman not to be broken without 40 hours notice couriers have been despatched to stop stoneman's raid at camden what it is i do not know but it can bode no good to us this the grand army of virginia which has heretofore never known defeat but has stood like some great rock against which the huge waves of our enemies have dashed themselves in vain is now melted away all that is left is johnston's small army cooped up between grant's hordes on the one hand and sherman's on the other wiser heads than mine say it must surrender and then the waves will roll over us the south lies prostrate their foot is on us there is no help during this short time we breathe but o who could have believed who has watched this four years struggle that it could have ended like this they say right always triumphs but what cause could have been more just than ours have we suffered all have our brave men fought so desperately and died so nobly for this for four years there has been throughout this broad land little else than the anguish of anxiety the misery of sorrow over dear ones sacrificed for nothing is all this blood spilled in vain will it not cry from the ground on the day we yield to these yankees we give up to the yankees how can it be how can they talk about it why does not the president call out the women if there are enough men we would go and fight too we would better all die together let us suffer still more give up yet more anything anything that will help the cause anything that will give us freedom and not force us to live with such people to be ruled by such horrible and contempible creatures to submit to them when we hate them so bitterly it is cruel it is unjust i used to dream about peace to pray for it but this is worse than war what is such peace to us what horrible fate has been pursuing us the last six months not much farther back than that we had every reason to hope for success what is the cause of this sudden crushing collapse i cannot understand it i never loved my country as i do now i feel i could sacrifice everything to it and when i think of the future oh god it is too horrible what i most fear is a cancilistory policy from the north that they will offer to let us come back as before oh no no i would rather we were held as a conquered province rather sullenly submit and bide our time let them oppress and tyrannize but let us take no favors of them let them send us away out of the country anywhere away from them and their hateful presence we are all very wretched poor father he had carrie in his arms just now but her innocent joy and laughter so grated upon him that he had to send her away it seems dreadful to see any one smile it seems impossible to utterly despair if we did we would be even more miserable than we are we feel instinctively that something must happen to avert our doom it is so terrible as to be unthinkable we have been so confident of final success that we cannot believe we are conquered what misfortune will i have to chronicle tomorrow i am too sick at heart to write any more friday april 21st hurrah old abe lincoln has been assassinated it may be abstractly wrong to be so jubilant but i just can't help it after all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light we have suffered till we feel savage there seems no reason to exult for this will make no change in our position will only infuriate them against us never mind our hated enemy has not the just reward of his life the whole story may be a yankee lie the despatch purports to be from stanton to sherman it says lincoln was murdered in his private box at the theatre on the night of the 14th good friday at the theatre the assassin brandished a dagger and shouting sic semper tyrannis virginia is avenged shot the president through the head he fell senseless and expired next day a little after ten the assassin made his escape in the crowd no doubt it was regularly planned and he was surrounded by southern sympathizers sic semper tyrannis could there have been a fitter death for such a man at the same hour nearly seward's house was entered he was badly wounded as also his son why could not the assassin have done his work more thoroughly that vile seward he it is to whom we owe this war it is a shame he should escape i was at mrs leland's saying my german when mrs snowden brought in the news we were all so excited and talked so much that wilhelm tell was quite forgotten our spirits had been so low that the least good news elevated them wonderfully and this was so utterly onlooked for took us so completely by surprise i actually flew home and for the first time in oh so long i was trembling and my heart beating with excitement i stepped in at aunt josie's to talk it over as soon as i reached the head of the stairs they all cried what do you think of the news isn't it splended etc we are all in a tremor of excitement at home it was the same if it is only true the first feeling i had when the news was announced was simply gratified revenge the man we hated has met his proper fate i thought with exultation of the howl it had by that time sent through the north and how it would cast a damper on their rejoicings over the fall of our noble lee the next thought was how it would infuriate them against us and that was pleasant too after talking it over the hope presented itself that it might produce a confusion that would be favorable but there is scarcely any likelihood of that he is hardly important enough for that andy johnson will succeed him the rail splitter will be succeeded by the drunken ass such are the successors of washington and jefferson such are to rule the south sic semper tyrannis it has run in my head all day trembles tyrans et vous perfides l'opprobres de toutes les parties tremblez vos projets parricides mont enfin recevoir leur prix what exciting what eventful times we are living in sunday april 23rd dr palmer this morning preached a fine and encouraging sermon he says we must not despair yet but even if we should be overthrown not conquered the next generation would see the south free and independent there is another rumor in town to the effect that the french fleet has defeated the yankee fleet and taken new orleans it is only a rumor and alas i dare not believe it the air is so full of rumors that one does not know what to believe they only keep us in a feverish state of uncertainty the more i think of lee's surrender the harder it is to bear that army that general we idolized stonewall jackson we worshipped lee it is perhaps well that president has so many enemies for if all loved as the others something would happen to him too how well i remember the death of stonewall jackson i can never forget my feelings when i heard of it we had heard he was very low but i did not dream he could die i was lying on the lounge alone in the library when father came in looking very sad emma he said gravely stonewall jackson is dead how i loved him he was my hero i then admired lee as grand magnificent but jackson came nearer my heart there was mourning deep and true throughout the land when that news came since then lee has had the hero worship all both his and jackson's though the dead hero will always be shrined in every southern heart but i am allowing old reminiscences to fill my mind and page not so old either only two years but events have crowded so thickly that it seems a long long time ago our beloved lee now that the first crushing grief for the country is passed in some measure away how deeply i feel for him how he must suffer not only the humiliation but to hold his hands in this hour of his country's greatest need what must it have meant to him to yield that sword and what are we to do without him i cannot feel hopeless today i do not feel as disheartened as i did last thursday when the news came the terrible news we still have an army in the west and dark as everything is we must hope the conviction that the south can not be conquered that it can never be re united with the north is so deeply rooted in my heart since the war began that conviction has never been shaken once till last thursday then i was so overwhelmed by the thought of lee's surrender that there seemed no ground under my feet even now there can be no hope but but in foreign aid but something must turn up help must come the darkest hour's before the dawn if there should be no dawn

cotton strewn on the ground as far as the eye can see near edwards depot may be seen pieces of wagons cannons and the cars that have been destroyed all giving evidences of war and its terrible effects some of the beautiful shrubbery still remains and all is now green and fresh looking pretty notwithstanding the surroundings i have gathered some flowers off the battlefield we were near where general tilghman was killed and general bowen died mrs bowen was with us she spoke of her husband during the walk mrs cook's was the last house he stayed at was taken a few miles on and died at some house in

came to see us soon after a flag of truce came in capt crains and lt clark of the u s army came with it federals and confederates chatting smoking and joking together all i think more in favor of a

with them we laughed at our endeavors to amuse them poor follows they need all the favors we can bestow lt wren bid us goodbye late this evening i don't think we will see him again he said he had not

brave god bless him and protect him from harm mrs bowen has returned she did not bring the things i sent for feel much disappointed house crowded with ladies on their way south they crossed the big

almost every tree has balls in it and the branches are torn away from many the maj picked up balls in the road we travelled until 8 o'clock at night it was beautiful moonlight we all stayed at mr thomas met mrs woodman of new york celebrity the one who created such a sensation in new york she was divorced from her husband a very uninteresting person i think they gave us no supper or breakfast april 14 1864 left early this morning met mally at clinton and she got into our wagon maj grant left and we regret his departure very much he has been exceedingly kind so many splendid residences

told us that his son in law mr radford married his daughter whom we found was an old acquaintance we called to see him and he was very pleased to see us we met the government wagon that had been sent

her baby with mrs boyd how kind the doctor and his wife have been to us we fared very well and missed nothing but coffee they use cornmeal parched for coffee and except for that they live very well we will now i fear find rough fare pass through brandon about 12 o'clock stopped at one and took lunch and enjoyed it very much good appetites find we have to go 13 miles before reaching a house travel slowly the mules being slow and tired travel until quite late into the night prospect poor sing to keep up our spirits reach a house at 8 o'clock beg for admission but are refused by a man named easton 3 4 mile from morton we told him we were travel worn our children sleepy our mules broken down while talking to him one of the carriage mules fell down we told him we only wanted shelter he then asked us where we were going we replied to see our husbands he said a great time to go to your husbands which so exasperated us that we whipped up our mules and started for morton there our mules gave out the sargeant went off in search of a house but to no effect while the sargeant was absent the wagon driver cut the sick mule's mouth so that he bled profusely we then went into mr binney's house a gentlemen from louisiana he finding we could get no further said he would do the best he could but could give us no bed we were thankful that his wife a very nice lady had a bed made on the floor in which mally eddie hattie and fanny slept georgie and i taking the sofa we went to bed supperless about 12 o'clock april 20 1864 slept badly got our faces washed found one mule in a poor condition mouth bleeding very much we can't stop it we feel very discouraged take a rough breakfast but don't enjoy anything we are so anxious about the mule it seems some better we have concluded to take the road to enterprise the mule is so weak it can scarcely pull hattie drives we walk two miles stop at a cabin and will rest here until 2 o'clock then go to hillsboro a distance of 10 miles we took a snack and gave 1.00 for a quart of meal for the sick mule which seems better come to the village by 6 o'clock very pleasant ride roads are not near so bad as we expected but the country seems an utter waste nothing for food for horses or humans the same cry is heard from house to house the yankees have destroyed all i had we seem to have quite a comfortable house to stay in tonight they brought us a small table bowl in which to wash our faces and told us their washbowls had been broken by the yankees that cry will haunt this country for many a day we hope to make an early start in the morning april 21 1864 another beautiful day we certainly have been very fortunate in having pleasant weather and so far have been agreeably disappointed in the roads i hope we may have a pleasant trip today we were very comfortable last night they charged us 20 each this is a very pretty place beautiful lawn just after leaving hillsboro i saw a confederate soldier running to the carriage i looked and to our surprise and joy saw it was johnny saunders dr saunders he was so delighted to see us he asked have you any letters for me we said no poor fellow the tears came into his eyes but he said nothing i would have given much to have had a letter for him while talking to him capt sheppard willie sheppard and capt dawson of ky rode up and we had a pleasant social time all so truly glad to see each other they rode on some distance with us we talked and sang for them georgie rode all the way with capt dawson he was delighted at one o'clock we took our dinner and they dined with us and enjoyed the sundries and cake very much we regretted to part with them but they promised if possible to meet us at enterprise and go with us to mobile at night we stayed with mrs evans a very comfortable place beautiful yard and everything neat our fare very good tea and coffee with butter and biscuit we met there some nice people from tennessee the gentleman was a minister and before retiring we had prayers it was refreshing to hear a prayer offered once more it has been 5 weeks since we left home and we have heard no minister discourse since then it seemed quite strange to hear a prayer offered for our beloved south after being so long in yankeedom and hearing the union prayed for april 22 1864 another pleasant day we asked for our bill and it was 25 all included very reasonable we have traveled very slowly today the mules very jaded stopped at a house and rested i saw a lady who was quite ingenious making very pretty hats out of palmetto and very prettily ornamented with the same a pedestrian caught up with us and asked permission to ride in the wagon we found him a cousin of mr ratcliff's of paducah and his name was isaiah ratcliff he seemed quite a nice person the mules are so weary we shall not be able to reach enterprise tonight we walked some distance this evening we met a gang of negroes with napsacks and they sent up a rousing cheer for jeff davis we are now at a cabin and some cavalry are camping near this place the family seem pleasant people though they dress very plainly in homespun the girls are pretty i would so much enjoy this trip if i only could know how my dear mother is i feel strong and well and have a great appetite april 23 1864 we spent a very comfortable night and met a new yorker in the service very earnest in the southern cause has been living in the south only six years we crossed the chickasawha about 12 o'clock and came to enterprise and found it difficult to find a house to stay even until the cars leave after some persuasion they consented to take us in but could give us nothing to eat while consulting as to the best course to pursue we heard cousin ed woolfolk had come to this place to meet us it was joyful news for we were beginning to feel quite helpless fearing we would find difficulty in taking care of our baggage indeed we were not certain that we would find our friends in mobile but now that cousin ed has come we will know what to do we have not seen him unfortunately he has gone to meet us and taken a different road so we missed him mally is quite impatient but i think bears it very patiently i feel quite impatient to see him myself oh where is my husband it seems so difficult to learn where our husbands are we have succeeded in getting a house for a short time with the promise of something to eat just after dinner cousin ed and henry jones came they rushed to meet us and there was of course great rejoicing henry jones was delighted to receive his letter i brought and the photographs tears of gratitude and pleasure came into his eyes i never felt so glad that i had a letter cousin ed brought me a letter from phil and i am delighted to hear he is in mobile we leave tonight at 8 o'clock in the cars it is pouring down rain and very dark and henry jones carried georgie to the depot while cousin ed goes with mally and i it is dreadful walking the water over shoe tops so dark we can't see where to go and i fell into two ditches and am wet and muddy to my waist a very disagreeable time april 25 1864 had a most unpleasant time in the cars so wet and cold they made a fire about 12 o'clock and i dried my clothes and shawls i don't know what i should have done if a gentleman had not been kind enough to lend me his shawl for georgie to lie in we got to mobile about 9 o'clock phil was a little surprised to see us did not expect to see us until tonight met him at the battle house esmondre browne mrs davis gus brown and mrs girard came to see us in the afternoon we called to see india brown she was very pleased to see us after tea mrs lay called and i am told that mr girard will take us to the fort tomorrow april 26 1864 we have been disappointed in not going to the fort walked out this afternoon went up government street very beautiful residences flowers all in bloom and some of the houses seem almost a mass of roses the air is perfumed with the odor from the flowers you meet children and women with waiters of bouquets the ladies look very handsome with their dark riding dresses and deep pointed cuffs riding horseback with the officers everything presents quite a gay appearance a great many military men here after tea mr davis called and spent the evening with us we had some good music april 27 1864 mr davis mally cousin ed mrs lay phil and the children and i all went to the music store tried some music i purchased six pieces for which i gave 20 how dreadfully high everything is i paid 2.00 for having my shoes cleaned and shawl brushed i could spend at week here so pleasantly if i could only hear from home dear ma how often i think of her we walked out again this evening what a beautiful city mobile is quite a feast to the eye so many splendid residences i think it the most beautiful place i have ever seen the magnolia trees very large and full of bloom just now oh they are beautiful i would so much like to live here after tea mr davis came to the parlor also mrs marable wife of dr marable an old friend of phil's very nice lady had quite an excitement it seems a lady had left her husband and he followed her and took her child age four from her poor woman i never heard such pleading all night she sobbed and wailed it was truly heartbreaking to hear her april 28 1864 am not very well today expected to leave this evening at 4 o'clock we did not leave as we expected a more pleasant boat leaves tomorrow mr ford my old schoolteacher called to see me this evening he lives here gen clark of missouri called to

his millions his wife is not permitted to come south and all her children are in the army poor woman in the general's reply to the question why should the southerners be taxed and kentucky and missouri troops exempt and where was the tax they paid replied in the best of coin blood and limbs he is a noble man and sent me his card with some nice strawberries phil sent us in some oysters they were very large but as we had no good dressing for them i did not enjoy eating them much oh my dear mother what would i give to be with you this night the love of a mother is very great and oh so consoling to a broken heart god only knows the heart's trials but oh my god thou who knowest the hearts of thy people give me strength to bear with patience the yoke thou hast seen fit i should bear oh may it better fit me for heaven bless my child if it be thou will spare him to me and give me wisdom and strength to bring him up in the way he should go april 29 1864 mrs lay called to see us also mr thad gibson met gen clark on the stairway he bid us goodbye and wished us much pleasure went down to the boat the henry j king about half past two o'clock mobile bay looked well especially to us as

wished and do as we liked on his boat he was a kentuckian capt harris of henry county kentucky the boat stopped some time at choctaw bluff and we walked through the fortification they are quite a curiosity i felt as if i were in some of the old ruins i have read of walking through the subterreanean passages the works are complete i tried to sleep this afternoon but it was so extremely warm i could not stay in the room while i write the perfume of a fine bouquet fills the cabin with a sweet odor april 30 1864 have been busy making a shirt for phil we passed selma about 6 o'clock in the afternoon and i am sorry we could not go up in town and see the machine shops they make all kinds of weapons cannon et cetera this is a more rocky country than i expected the water running down the rocks looks so refreshing after drinking the warm river water one of the servants hearing me express a wish for some took a pitcher and got some from one of the streams in the afternoon bishop wilmer came on board he is a pleasant gentlemen and does much good among his people after supper we went on deck and had some music we sing quite like a travelling troupe we made a pleasant little home circle had it not been for the absence of our loved mother and friends we could have enjoyed it very much oh it seems so far from home we sang our old kentucky home and all were heartsick except the bishop mr davis is very agreeable the captain does all in his power to make us feel at home he seems pleased to have us with him at supper the waiters favored me it seemed quite like old times to have such attention from the negroes

a very pleasant religious conversation with him we all got ready to go to church and hear the bishop but it rained so hard it prevented our going much disappointed we have all concluded to go back to mobile on a pleasure trip we wish only to be with our husbands so it will be quite as pleasant on the boat as in the hotel by the kind permission of the captain his wife will go also and mrs gen

and am anxious to hear from home may 8 1864 arrive at montgomery and go to hotel montgomery hall take breakfast very good and go to the episcopal church hear an excellent sermon and a prayer for the president of the confederate states oh how strange it sounded after hearing the prayer for the president of the united states so long a beautiful prayer for the success of our cause the suffering prisoners wounded orphans and widows and thanks for our recent victory in virginia how beautifully he spoke though the air trembled with the news of another great victory the sound brought anguish and desolation to many hearts our friend bishop wilmer was there i hope there may be much good done in the army i hear there is a great change for the better and i pray god it may continue after tea i met

like starvation here there is nothing here that reminds us of the war except the anxious hearts of mothers and friends and the conversation of the gentlemen everything is quite indeed all that is beautiful to the eye can be seen here the place seems laden with flowers and the perfume of flowers as i write a child passed with a handful of the largest roses i have ever seen and magnolia blossoms it seems strange that those who live in such a beautiful country can be at war with one another near us is the church where they have the union prayermeetings to pray for our army god grant us peace tis such a calm beautiful evening all so quiet i an writing in the balcony of the hotel many persons have passed mostly schoolgirls and young ladies i see no scarcity of dress materials all look neat it is almost dark occasionally i hear a footstep but in this quiet there is heard all around the sweetest sounds from the mocking birds i never experienced so perfect a calm and this is quite a large place all sounds seemed hushed except that of the birds truly this is one of god's loveliest spots it is a fit place to worship our god for all around seems quiet and loveliness may 14 1864 nothing

little furniture she could find for temporary use if this be a poor dying struggle oh beautiful south you are glamorous even in your death we returned about 2 o'clock most of the company there were

blind tom was on it he is certainly one of the greatest wonders of the day indeed the greatest his memory is wonderful his powers for imitating equally so and his musical talent surpasses anything i ever heard or dreamed of we went to his concert tonight he played the most difficult pieces composed and arranged beautifully his imitation of old uncle charlie of kentucky was very good and he repeated word for word as he heard uncle charlie speak his piece called manassas battle his conception of a battle from hearing the newspapers read was splendid has imitations playing of the organ guitar banjo and violin etc after we returned home he came into our part of the hotel and we sang for him and he seemed pleased most of the time when he heard no music he was turning around like a top a very singular person may 19 1864 we are invited this morning to mrs conley's and have to accept as we declined last evening we are sorry we cannot hear blind tom again cousin ed left this morning i

by the young ladies of the baptist college i failed to mention the sum given by the audience 1000 for the benefit of camp watts phil was requested to sing brave boys and they soon made up a sum the

afraid i cannot stand the trip if i travel all day and sleep none at night went this morning to ride went to the cemetery and saw little georgie balfour's tomb the inscription was two verses of the little hymn i want to be an angel the same my own sweet georgie often repeats i thought oh shall he too sleep in an unknown tomb in a strange land and among strange people little georgie balfour was the son of our kind friends and died in montgomery with dyptheria as they were moving from mississippi to tuskegee as refugees my own little boy reminded them so much of their lost one i feel better

oh that i was prepared for heaven how gladly would i welcome the call of my saviour but i pray for patience and strength to bear my trials oh the sorrow of a heart that sorrows all alone why is it that those we most love often cause us the most sorrow and the noblest and best of men allow themselves to be led into evil by those who call themselves friends but oh what a blessed hope to know that there is a home for us where we shall know no sorrow if we only hold out in faith god bless my boy he is a comfort to me sunday july 17 1864 a delightful morning slept finely last night had quite a good breakfast of oysters etc hattie and i went over into the bay to bathe and it was splendid it reminded me of my visit to old point comfort if i had been here all this time i think it would have benefited me much i took my georgie in with me and he was delighted at dinner the ladies were all dressed very handsomely it looked little like war as i write i hear the waves dashing over the beach and the breeze blows in so delightfully i feel as if i were on some northern seashore i think a few weeks here would benefit me so much the baths have already done so i feel stronger met major and mrs

hurried up to be ready for capt leake he has kindly offered to take charge of me to paducah am all ready for the hack oh my dear husband how can i bid you goodbye perhaps for the last time sorrow sorrow the world is full of trouble how hard to tear myself away god bless you my darling god bless you it is all over i have left him every hour separates us farther and farther i am left alone with my boy i have not even the satisfaction to know i will soon meet my dear mother for months have elapsed since i heard and what may not have happened in that time oh my mother god spare you to me i come to devote my life to my god my mother and my child what is life but a scene of sorrow and strife we stop on our way an hour at dr temple's they are disappointed we are not going to spend a few days i regret i cannot stay tonight at a mr boyd's just here i see a piece written by my dear husband just before we parted he too is filled with sad forebodings i thank thee oh my god that he does not know how they have been realized i suppose from what i hear that i have been note written in diary by philip hugh wallace grenada mississippi july 27 1864 after nearly three years of bitter and cruel separation my darling wife on tomorrow we must separate again you to a life of loneliness and privation and i to one of danger and sorrow god only can know dearest how in the long and cruel time of our separation i longed for your loving embrace and sympathy and how since our unhoped for reunion i have dreaded this sad hour the dread of which has come darkly and remorselessly between every pleasure which i hoped to share with you any my dear bright noble boy must he go too when i perhaps may never behold his dear form again and the time may come when my name may not recall one single remembrance of his father and yet darling as cruel as it is i humbly thank our merciful god that he has once more permitted me to gather you both to my heart even but to tear you from me again and more than all that he has left me the sweet hope that alter our faith has been tried and purified he will again in his own good time bring us together never more to part when we least expected he brought us together from distant parts of the earth and why may it not be so again you have often said that god has brought our present calamities on us because we did not properly appreciate our past happiness how fully do i feel at this sad hour how little i know or appreciated my own as you and my dear boy are leaving me to go far into the dim uncertainties of the future peopled with enough of known misery and sorrow to fill me with dread and oh of how much that is left me to imagine there is but one thing left us and that is trust in god's providence which has done so much for us and the hope that it may not desert us in the future you have sometimes said you wished when unavoidable troubles came upon us that you had not come to me should it chance that we are forever separated in this life every day and hour of the past few months and every spot visited by us will be fraught with the deepest interest and the recollection of it grow brighter and dearer through life you will always recur to this dear visit as the greatest spot in your memory and in future years how we shall both delight to talk with our dear boy until he almost imagines he recollects each circumstance and place no darling let to continue to woo the sweet presence of hope to remain with us and whilst separated live over the pleasures of the dead past blotting from our memory its dark spots and looking only on its bright ones god never made us perfect then why expect impossibilities and repine when we have had and still have so such to make us happy and behold a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another through the coming time of our separation your image and our dear boy's shall be ever with me sleeping or waking in sickness in health in quiet or in danger to bless and cheer me and not recalled in order to bring to mind some unpleasant reminiscence of the past i pray god it may be so with you each succeeding year robs us of some loved friend or some cherished hope let us then cling the closer together and build new hopes on the ruins of the fallen when i am far away and something recalls my foibles and my faults remember that in spite of them my heart was true to you that i have but one wife and one darling boy to whom my heart clings as its anchor and to whom it will continue to cling while i live stripped of all i possess well be it so there is one who will give me a home not prepared with hands if i hold out faithful and i defy them to rob me of that saturday july 30 1864 rested badly was eaten by the fleas start again this morning find some trouble in getting a carriage to take us through the lines get a spring wagon expect to be stopped by the pickets as they are allowing no one to pass without a pass have reached memphis had no trouble with the

leake tells me it is best not to go to paducah until he returns he will see if it is safe for me to go that i might be arrested most of my friends have been sent out of the united states what a state of affairs was such tyranny ever exercised over a people surely the demons of the lower regions have been set loose this man payne is surely a devil on earth but there is a home in heaven for us if we hold out faithful what is the envy and hate of poor insignificant men if we have the love of god capt leake has gone and i am disappointed in going but i am used to disappointment mr hatchett is very kind memphis tennessee wednesday august 3 1864 busy downtown making purchases preparatory for my banishment to canada with the rest of my friends where my dear mother and brother is i don't know hope i will join them soon thursday august 4 1864 this is lincoln's fast day seems quite quiet except for the negroes who have possession of the town the confederates are killing off the while soldiers so fast it is well to favor the blacks as much as possible to make them fight the negro is better than these uncivilized cruel brutish yankees but enough i dislike to soil my book by mentioning such butchers in it i feel very unwell the weather is so sultry and warm it weakens me friday august 5 1864 none can imagine the anxiety with which i await news from my friends and you my dear husband could you but know the condition of things how much harder could you fight and with what a feeling of revenge would meet the persecutors of your loved ones i spoke kindly of them told you to have mercy and believe that many were conscientious in their belief little thinking they were battling with women and children instead of meeting the enemy face to face and fighting like soldiers for their country no gain is their object and theft is their business saturday august 6 1864 downtown all morning shopping as i returned i called at the postoffice and got a letter from cousin coleman woolfolk he informed me that my dear mother was well and in paducah i am thankful to hear that my brother is in vincennes but what are his arrangements and where his family is i don't know capt leake has not yet returned have been going at night to hear mr miller a baptist minister who is a fine speaker i hope i may profit by his teaching sunday august 7 1864 went again this morning to hear mr miller preach georgie went to sunday school with mr hatchett he behaved very well at church went again at night to hear mr miller who says he met brother robert on the boat and nannie in owensboro i can't imagine what nannie is doing there but my family are so scattered i am not surprised to hear anything poor ma to think of tearing her from her children in her old age when she has lived only for them if they have banished brother robert it is i fear a final farewell between my dear mother and her oldest child she is 69 years old and cannot expect to be long on this earth tuesday august 9 1864 i did not get off on the city alton capt leake has not yet returned am getting very impatient august 10 1864 hope to hear from home feel very badly have a cold in my head quite an excitement in this neighborhood the dogkiller has been around and the horse that carries the dead dogs gave out and they have been whipping him and killing dogs until i am sick at the sight of so much cruelty and heartlessness he is certainly one of the most cruel wretches i have seen my hand trembles now from excitement i wonder what news mr hatchett will bring now for me thursday august 11 1864 felt some better this morning but about noon felt so badly i had to go to bed i fear i am going to be sick august 12 1864 spent a restless night am out of bed but don't know how long i will be able to keep up have heard nothing more from home home oh where is home friends and relatives gone home taken there is no security from such tyrants this suspense is terrible i know nothing of any of my family except that they are sent from paducah my mother is in paducah but whether she will be permitted to stay i don't know saturday august 13 1864 capt leake has returned gives me little satisfaction says there is only military despotism in paducah friends dare not recognize a friend on the street he could do nothing for me he saw my dearest mother and mary and the children when they left paducah they were allowed to take only their wearing clothes they left with proud bearing not a tear was shed though their hearts were heavy they did not allow the monster payne to witness their distress though he came down to the wharfboat to see them depart hoping no doubt to see tears and distress and to be pleaded with to be allowed to remain thank god they bore it bravely as every true southern woman does i read this morning an article from the cairo paper speaking of their departure the writer must have been some poor low unprincipled creature whose standing heretofore has been doubtful as i read i became so indignant i felt as if i were a man how quickly would i join the southern army and how savagely would i fight sunday august 14 1864 heard mr miller again am more and more pleased with him in the afternoon i went to see mrs turley august 15 1864 i am determined to go to cairo slept more last night note a page missing containing dates august 16 17 and part of aug 18th these pages evidently refer to the members of her family who were banished to canada by gen payne and gen grant the diary continues describing the trip of her relatives north to canada august 18 1864 they found many southern friends on crossing the river with the guard it incensed the british authorities they say they had no right to cross they met some of morgan's men escaped prisoners who were very indignant that ladies should be sent under negro guards but nothing surprises me now i hope my family will get on comfortably some kind gentleman from detroit michigan invited them to make his house their home but i believe they will remain for awhile in canada i am waiting to see coleman woolfolk before deciding what step to take next mr scanland went down to dinner with us he was very polite friday august 19 1864 while in the parlor last night mrs gus browne and frank mccloud came in much to my surprise mrs browne informs me that gen payne will not permit me to return to paducah that he will send mrs wallace and mrs woolfolk to central america have been looking for coleman woolfolk to come and tell me what is best to do i spent a most unpleasant evening servants very remiss some time before i could get a servant and then my door had no fastening but i slept very well after i did go to bed gen payne's son has taken my house it is filled with young men and i suppose is the scene of dissappation of all kinds well it is but my earthly home and would have occupied by me but a short time true it is associated with some of my happiest hours it was my home the birthplace of my only child i have been happy there and it grieves me to know a place so sacred to me should be desecrated by such people i fear many things i prize are in the hands of those unprincipled fellows letters etc they have gone from me past and gone as almost every old association but these people we all will soon pass away and the places that know us will know us no more so it matters little what we have in this world saturday august 20 1864 last night after tea i had the pleasure of a call from mr charles riche he gave me much news cousin richard brought me two letters to ma and one from brother robert in windsor canada and one from dr stearnes i have sent them to her and written her to come down here cousin richard and i came to see mrs mccauly and ask her to take us for a week or ten days she consented i came this afternoon and found emerson ethridge boarding here he is very sociable and entertaining he is more i think opposed to the administration than to rebellion sunday august 21 1864 i have spent most of the day in my rooms have not felt well what a lonely life i have led for the past few weeks i can take no interest in anything or anybody about 4 o'clock this afternoon my dear mother came i was not expecting her she looked better than i had hoped georgie was out walking but knew her as soon as he saw her august 22 1864 ma and i slept but little last night talked most

january 1st 1864 last night we retired in peace and quietude feeling that we had been wonderfully preserved from the ravages during the past year we had been so long unmolested that we almost ceased to fear for the future and to settle down in quiet indifference all our neighbors had fled into the interior with one exception kate lang had remained although ready to flee at the first approach of danger we were startled from a sound sleep by sybil and gussie coming in to tell us that a shell had just been fired on our bluff and that the yankees were probably at the wharf mr fisher very incredulous went out to explore but soon returned laughing at the lively imagination of the household nothing was to be seen or heard gussie caught his gun and ran down to the mill we went to bed again and to sleep soon gussie returned with the information that the old mill was on fire and the yankees had taken to their boats and gone down the river so they had come at last and caught us napping the pickets were roused from their slumbers by the firing of the shell and ran to the woods leaving horses and guns behind the shell went through the warehouse bursting inside destroying some nice machinery and throwing the door from its hinges they then fired small arms one shot raised a splinter on mr brazil's house we conclude that they intended firing the new mill first but perhaps seeing mrs brazil who was spinning by a bright fire and knowing that her family might be endangered by it dropped down to the old mill where they soon made an illumination capt beadick's company came down in the morning viewed the ruins and returned on christmas night fairfields was burnt a little before bellevue both old homes of mr floyd this is the beginning of our new year and we have had many deprivations since the beginning of this war but no actual suffering our main living has been pork rice and hominy parched grits for coffee without milk or sugar how often we talk of the good things we once enjoyed and wonder if we shall ever enjoy them again a slice of bread and butter and a sweetened cup of tea would be a treat indeed such a treat as we have not enjoyed for more than a year our severe trials appear to be just commencing thus far war has been in the distance now its ravages are becoming tangible sybil feels almost overwhelmed with her many trials and predicts a gloomy future our greatest trial at present is this exile from friends we feel completely bound there is no way of escape only one letter has reached us in two years from home and that contained the news of my mother's death oh how i long to fly away and be free must we be pent in the wilderness for years yet to come we see no prospect of peace people are afraid to let us have their negroes we are so near the coast we have now a man and woman and two children but they are not enough dianah is now away having her christmas and we feel quite uncomfortable to be obliged to cook and run about in the cold although we live so retired and so plain there is a good deal of work to be done on the place mr fisher and john are clearing up a new place and making fence for a garden we have been down to see the ruins the wind blows and it is the coldest day of the season thermometer at 22 january 3rd sunday the children in the village are now old enough to begin to learn a few weeks since we commenced having a sabbath school there are five in the class only one knew the alphabet they seem very anxious to learn and learn readily but mr brazil is so frightened at the coming of the enemy that he has resolved to move away and that takes away the three little girls i am sorry to lose them and they seem equally sorry to go the sabbaths are so quiet and lonely they weary us the children now know all their letters and seem to have received their first idea of their maker the oldest is scarcely ten years of age and very sickly she told me today that although she could not read and write she can iron and scrub it is said that she and the next aged eight cook wash etc if this war continues long i fear that such will be our fate the negroes are becoming so scarce dianah returned after dinner with her two children had walked about eight miles in the rain she brought a hen and a bottle of syrup for clarence a christmas gift mr linn came home to visit his family from camp to the great joy of his wife who has been mourning for him she and her little boy are entirely alone and pass as lonely a life as can well be imagined having to sit by the fire week after week without sewing or knitting and almost without reading there is no cloth to be had and no thread no yarn nor anything to do with time passes heavily under such circumstances it makes us think of home and the abundance we once enjoyed but however great our longings there is no redress for three long years the world has been comparatively lost to us we know nothing of the changes that have taken place during that time in dress we are just where we were in 1860 for fashion but rags and wrinkles are more plentiful mr fisher dressed very shabbily i have used bedticking sheets curtains and the linings of my dresses to clothe him and now we know not where to get anything more all the old spinning wheels in the country have been put in operation and every thread that is spun has a quick demand mrs linn wears a course homespun dress that cost her 42.00 now we cannot purchase even at that rate mr linn brings the good news that old black nelly is coming to live with them again which has brought joy to the household january 4th today clarence is five years old he is the darling of the household but in danger of being spoiled in consequence gussie has now arrived at the conscript age and is making arrangements to join the army fred has come home after an absence of two months he has been to thomasville to visit julia ellis widow found her pleasantly situated surrounded by a large circle of friends she introduced him to several young ladies and he is now in love with thomasville wishes his mother to move there as he has come to the conclusion we are on the jumping off place of creation i only wish i could see a place to jump julia sent mr fisher six yards of striped homespun for shirts a rich and welcome gift and gratefully received this induces us to take a retrospective view of things when cloth and shirts were abundant such as would now cost five dollars a yard extortion is carried on at a high rate we fear that we have not seen the worst january 6th we are now having our rainy season and we are drenched inside and out the house leaks badly nails are so scarce that whenever a building is burned there is a quick demand for nails mr brazil has gone with his family to brookfield to an old dilapidated house without windows and almost demolished by the pickets it is two miles from here they think they may bring the children over to sunday school i am sorry to have them go they felt so interested and anxious to learn now we have only frank linn and clarence yesterday mr fisher and the boys went to jeffersonton to town meeting came home in a soaking rain and brought half a sack of flour which cost 35.00 we could easily eat it in a week but it will be kept for a luxury the best thing that we have now is a corn cake mixed with water our corn is ground in a hand mill which holds about 4 quarts and is very hard to grind the rice is beaten from the hull in a mortar made from a log and burnt out which is also a very hard process particularly when there is a large hungry family to feed those two articles with pork have constituted our living for a year past sometimes not all of that on christmas day we fared sumptuously mrs lynn dined with us and furnished the turkey we had some chickens and a piece of fresh pork gussie had been off ten miles and brought oysters so we had an oyster stew and chicken salad minus the greens potatoes and rice the turkey was dressed with corn bread our dessert was a corn meal pudding wet with water enriched with bottled huckleberries and pork fat sauce made of borrowed syrup and flour it was excellent how we did relish it but we talked of the good pies and bread and cakes that linger in remembrance and the nuts and apples that pass around so freely in that land of plenty it is hard to be so entirely deprived of them but we try to console ourselves with the fact that we enjoy better health and appetites we are always hungry hungry the year round but do not grow fat january 7th sybil made arrangements with mr lynn for moving the machinery out the new mill to save it from the enemy it is proposed to move it back into the woods and cover it there has been great destruction of property here by the pickets as well as the enemy instead of a protection they are a great injury and nuisance not one raised a finger to save any property from the fire and no person has been near us we are in a desolated region should the enemy burn us out we know not where to go sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof we can see the kind hand of providence extended over us gussie has joined capt beaddick's company and appears pleased at the idea of standing guard he and fred will be at home some days we eagerly watch for the mail to see if there are any indications of peace but all is black as midnight they are bound to fight to the bitter end and bitter enough it will be sybil has sent about the country to get some syrup but none is to be had it brings from five to ten dollars a gallon and sugar 3.00 per lb it is hard to sweeten at that rate confederate money is very lightly esteemed fred thinks it hard to live on pork and hominy but we shall be quite thankful if we can have enough of that january 13th rain rain there has been almost constant rain since the month came in all have colds we curl over the fire eat heartily of hog and hominy three times a day we have become so disgusted with the black muddy corn juice that is called coffee that we have resumed tea again it is rather a bitter dose but has proved such a tonic for me that my allowance of food scarcely satisfies me fred is still dissatisfied with the lack of variety but i think the lack of quantity is most to be feared the boys draw rations about a quart of rice and a pound of bacon for fifteen days the poor soldiers who have no homes to go to are to be pitied our boys are now here on picket duty will be off in a few days it costs them a great deal to live in camp provisions are so high pork 1.50 per pound eggs 2.00 per dozen mr linn has got a part of the machinery out of the new mill it looks melancholy to see it taken down before it has had time to run it was raised at a great expense and just ready for operation when the war put a stop to all business here we are now beginning to plant the garden hoping to have something in the way of vegetables we had very little last year but fruit was unusually abundant every tree and bush being full peaches and plums in the garden berries in profusion for miles around us they afforded us good living for several weeks a letter has reached us from aug and ophelia informing us of the death of frank poor frank has ended his sorrowful life after a long sickness dead a whole year before the tidings reached us they write for us to go home we are so desirous to go that we hardly know how to wait and yet we may be obliged to stay another year this is the second letter that we have received during the last two years january 16th we have had a dreary winter thus far cold and wet augustus letter has increased our desire to go north we have talked with sybil about it she felt at first unreconciled but upon deliberation has concluded that it may be best mr fisher is feeble and feels as if he must go back where he can mingle with friends and have a living more congenial to his tastes the undertaking seems great and hazardous we know not how to manage nor who to apply to for advice or assistance mrs chappelle and autie wish to go with us it seems difficult for me to determine what is right mr fisher feels that he is not called to sacrifice his entire happiness to remain it is hard to part with clarence and there's after all an attachment to this forest home the fruit trees that we planted with our own hand the flowers that we have cultivated with so much labor the palmettoes that we have so delighted to gather and braid the fields of berries and the little sacred burying ground under the cluster of cedars all have a charm i shall want to see them again and our light wood fires that are so bright and cheerful on a cold day this is the sunny side the more we think of going north the more good reasons present themselves for going january 22nd frank linn got badly hurt by a heavy iron wheel which fell upon him it was a very narrow escape from death no bones were broken whatever may occur there is no physician within sixteen miles it is a busy time here mr fisher is laboring hard with black john to finish the new garden fence the little garden in the midst of the forest has a very pleasant look sybil has been three days boiling soap out doors it reminds one of a gypsy camp when dianah gets out with her baby stirring the pots she has a pretty little mulatto three months old we take it often into the house nurse it and kiss it and put it in our own beds to sleep it was a cold morning when it came to us about three o'clock fred awoke us with the information that there was a fuss at the negro house we ran as quick as possible and there was the little fellow on the cold floor shivering he had met with a cold reception we took him into the house before a good fire and he looked as white as anybody's baby he was soon nicely fixed in the clothes basket clarence was surprised and delighted with the sight and it has been his great pleasure ever since to hold and fondle little josey major bailey says he has given him to clarence whether he is in earnest or not we know not we hear that mr epstein the postmaster and his wife have fled to the yankees they passed the pickets in the night and had a boat hid in some creek he is a jew and did not like the idea of going into the army everything that can hold a gun must go and many would like to flee january 26th mr fisher and myself went to see mrs alberti who lives in florida and has just returned from the north to get information she found great difficulty in obtaining a passport to return and met with so many detentions and obstacles that it has quite dampened my ardor for going but mr fisher is in no wise daunted i dislike to leave on account of sybil and feel as if there is great uncertainty about going we stayed over night with mrs alberti had a cup of real coffee and tea with sugar and milk and biscuit and butter our ride was about 23 miles and all the way through pine woods now and then a house to cheer the sight we were upset once by the breaking of a rein the buggy was turned completely over and left in the gutter we fortunately were near a house where we procured help the spinning wheel was going briskly the women were hard at work trying to clothe the family while the men were in the army they were indifferent as to the termination of the war if it would only end that they might be kept from starvation we stopped at dr mitchell's mrs mitchell put on an old cloak to hide her rags and says they are experiencing great destitution we have frequent applications from people far and near for clothing so far as we can ascertain people seem certain that the confederacy is short lived that this year must terminate the war confederate money is almost valueless worth only five cents on the dollar dr mitchell prepared for me a bottle of cough mixture and a few powders charged 8.00 sent in sybil's bill a little short of 300 for eight or nine visits and refuses confederate money julia writes that she will soon visit us and bring some necessary articles january 31st today et is 48 years old i fear we shall be old women when we meet again should we be so favored yesterday we had another letter from augustus nothing new but mrs edward's marriage mrs brazil with five children one at the breast with mule and cart came over to bring the children to sabbath school they seem very eager to learn the weather is summer like we sit with open doors and find the sun very oppressive
february 1st 1864 went down to mrs linn's found her quite depressed the tears were ready to break through to sit all day and look in the fire without work of any kind her near neighbors gone and husband gone back to the army or to savannah was more than she could bear and then she had been looking for three days for old nelly if she should not come that would be worse than all while we were commiserating the forlorness of things in general nell's black head peered through the window but it shed light within we sprang towards her and felt that we could give her a warm embrace light and joy entered the household in the form of an old worn out negro thus we are lead to appreciate what we once cast away as almost useless gussie came home and spent the sabbath in order to get a change of clothes he is on picket near st mary's and enjoys it much as there is a family of girls where he can spend his leisure time fred is still at home groaning over pork and hominy we indulge in flour once a day sybil has engaged 100.00 worth of syrup it is 6.00 a gallon it is thought that she may get a little sugar at 2.00 per pound kate lang says that major bailey paid 6.00 a yard for calico in savannah it is now selling at 10.00 only 100.00 for a calico dress a fine state of things confederate money is hardly worth picking up they are collecting an army of 80,000 to have a finishing battle in the spring god speed the right february 6th the weather is now delightful and summer like all are busy planting and clearing the land cabbages and radishes are up as much as i wish to go north i feel reluctant to leave this beautiful climate that has been so conducive to health my bronchial troubles give me a dread of chilling winds and snow banks we have taken no steps yet for obtaining a passport the difficulties seem to me almost insurmountable but mr fisher has more hope and resolution gen clinch is far from us and our means of transportation is limited and poor we have not been able for some weeks to procure postage stamps so that we can not write letters sybil is trying to make a pair of shoes from hide of home made tanning mr fisher suffers with his heavy army shoes fred does not like to appear with holes in his forty five dollar shoes and poor little clarence is scuffing around in anything that can be tied on the negroes are bare footed shoes are not to be thought of for them oh how we all long for a time of peace and plenty for our once happy land that was flowing with milk and honey yesterday i told mr fisher i had been preparing some little things in anticipation of going home oh he says it revives me to hear you say so we retire early to forget the lonliness at the same time admitting that we have many comforts february 9th we have had another letter from mrs chappelle from columbus she is making preparation to leave in the spring and will come to kate lang's and start from there we hope to be able to go with them but to leave sybil is the trouble we live in hopes that there will be a change in our national affairs for the better before that time though the papers and the people tell us that there is no prospect we had a letter from julia on sunday saying that she would be at the nearest railroad point on next wednesday which is a distance of eighty miles fred started off in a hurry as it would take him two days to go it is a long tedious journey mostly through woods and no where to stop at night but to beg a lodging with some private family one feels that they are truly passing a wilderness life in camden county and we are exiles indeed a half barrel of syrup and small bucket of sugar holding 30 lbs came to sybil yesterday for which she pays 174.00 we are glad to have something for a luxury when julia comes we have only flour enough for three or four meals the pork is nearly gone too we must kill the only passable hog we have before she comes potatoes are getting low until the vegetables come in from the garden we see nothing in prospect but corn and rice that will go very well with syrup what if famine stalks throughout the land it is impossible to submit to lincoln rule they must fight while life lasts february 14th sabbath julia is with us we are enjoying much she and sybil have gone to visit the graves of their husbands mr fisher is writing to augustus yesterday kate lang came over in their double carriage to call on julia she brought me a letter from mary what joy to get a letter and yet we expect that they will contain sad news benny's marriage depresses me and yet i should rejoice at his happiness but with the loss of emily we lose a great deal poor et too sees much trouble and affliction and abby how i long to see them all so many changes sadden me friend after friend departs who has not lost a friend i long to go to my family but where can i go now we begin to feel separations and fearful changes my heart is heavy and lonely we are continually wondering what is best for us to do every gleam of sunshine is beclouded our bright visions of happiness have departed julia makes many plans for us but we are too short sighted to know which way to turn february 18th a day of great anxiety rapid firing in the region of king's ferry from sunrise until dark our boys are both probably engaged in the fray maj bailey sent word yesterday to julia that she had better remain a while longer as it could be hardly safe to travel we are in great anxiety the weather very cold sleet and rain freezing as fast as it falls a tedious night for the poor wounded soldiers julia and sybil talk of going with the mule and buggy tomorrow to dr mitchell's hoping to gather intelligence dianah is sick in bed and everything looks gloomy the people generally are in a state of alarm the pickets have all been called in and we are entirely unprotected hope to hear the result of the battle tomorrow the battle of olustee february 21st the battle is over nobody hurt the enemy came up the river for mrs albert's lumber and shelled all day to keep our pickets off a lavish expendition for their government julia has started for home with adam sybil has gone as far as mrs lang's with her we shall miss her much she is so full of life and talk she has taken a baked chicken and eggs to stop at dr mitchell's over night yesterday had a letter from autie chappelle manifesting great anxiety to get north provisions are so high they are troubled to live february 25th a letter from esther telling that the homestead is sold we have no longer a father mother or home i did not expect to see this day nor such a time for our country julia wrote us from the station that she was obliged to sleep in a negro house in the care of negroes one night and that some of the wounded soldiers had come on the cars terribly mangled the rebels are incensed at mrs alberti suspecting her of having dealings with the enemy they threatened to burn all her buildings yesterday mr fisher and sybil went to brookfield in the cart mrs brazil has named her little girl julia fisher i know of no other reason than because i have taught her little girls on the sabbath our peach and plum trees are in bloom but are injured by the severe frosts we have had an unusually cold winter
march 13th the children came from brookfield and we had our little sabbath school they were attentive and learn well we have had another letter from augustus which has given us much satisfaction it is so cheering to get tidings from home and one from fred who is now in the florida war he is seeing hard times they are fighting with great desperation since his letter came they have had another battle we are all feeling lonely and discouraged again mrs linn is mostly confined to the house and feels that she can hardly bear her secluded life much longer her husband is in savannah sybil is in great doubts as regards the future we would all if we could spread our wings and fly away to liberty and friends march 15th mr fisher is 76 years old today kate lang and all the children walked over to see us this morning and settle an affair with the negroes willie bailey dined with us on rice and hominy our pork is gone and there's no prospect for any meat at present the pigs fatten too slowly to supply the demand mr fisher caught a squirrel in a trap which was served for his breakfast kate says they are obliged to economize closely at their table famine threatens to follow in the wake of the war fred writes that he has but one meal a day which he cooks himself and his house suffers for want of food the confederates fight like tigers with a yell and a whoop march 20th no news yet from gussy and we fear no mail no one but franky came in to s school we have been out of meat some days live on corn and rice yesterday kate sent us a potato pie and radishes such a treat and one day in the week mrs linn gave us a piece of venison we have kind and thoughtful neighbors they send many nice bits don't know when we shall have a pig ready to kill no one has anything to sell all are short it takes a fortune to send to the city shoes 100 a pair flour 200 a barrel eggs 3.00 per dozen it is thought there will soon be a reduction gussy took over 1,500 with him hope no evil has befallen him he has been gone ten days march 20th gussy has just come with a loaded mule goods sent by julia in exchange for some cast off clothing for mine she has received 217.00 confederate money worth about 5 on the dollar having no opportunity for spending the money i concluded to invest it in land thinking it might become profitable sybil has received some mourning goods and cloth for the boys once worth from ten to twelve cents a yard now from six to twelve dollars bringing a calico dress to 100.00 a calico shirt to 40.00 the bubble must burst before long we feel a great longing for englewood it constitutes my day dreams we want northern comforts it is tedious to spend half the time catching fleas and the other half in sleeping and eating hominy and rice the thought of milk potatoes and good bread makes us mourn for a return of good times march 25th i have sent a letter to mary to learn more of the dutch cottage and what the prospects are for obtaining it we have not yet a passport for going north and the time is drawing near when we wish to go miss chappelle writes from columbus that they are nearly destitute and must if possible get north they will spend a few weeks with kate which will lighten their trouble in a measure it takes a long time here to accomplish anything we are so far away from everybody and everything the railroad is about 80 miles distant and it costs a fortune to go anywhere 30.00 per day for board 10.00 to stop over night and everything in the same ratio march 28th today i am fifty years old half a century i feel mute with amazement time how short and what a life march 30th mr fisher went over to maj bailey's today to consult about getting a passport this seems the most difficult part of all i have but little faith in getting one and it will make a heavy expense to go to savannah probably cost a 100.00 sybil seems to be getting in a bad way her whole body swells badly and has a good deal of pain if she is no better we shall be unwilling to leave her we have been obliged to kill a pig poor and tough hardly fat enough to fry itself
april 3rd by economizing the pig lasted us eight days now we are again without meat and on short allowance last night mr fisher caught in a trap rice birds enough for supper they are very small and without butter or pork to season are not very rich eating but everything eatable is worth saving the pigs are all poor and slab sided look half starved they cannot fatten on rough rice it is miserable food the horses refuse it we long for the north englewood fills my waking thoughts a snug comfortable kitchen a thing unknown here freedom from fleas and thousands of poisonous insects good inviting food such as we had been accustomed to having until this war broke out and freedom sweet freedom why did i not understand and price my liberty more april 6th we still eat our rice and corn three times a day no meat we are surprised to find how comfortable we can be with so little surely man's necessities are small mr linn came home on ten days furlough he says that flour is 300 per barrel men's coarse boots 250.00 he bought a bottle of squills for 5.00 and a pound of soda for 5.00 for sybil we had letters from julia with 70.00 for me and 50.00 for sybil for old clothing money not worth shucks we can neither spend it nor keep it it will be good for nothing after the first of july this currency business is a perfect swindle kate sent over for sybil to go to king's ferry with her tomorrow the weather continues cool it has been an unusually close winter from the breathings of the northern snowhills april 8th last night we were awakened by a shell and rose from our beds to see the new mills and the adjoining buildings on fire the little schooner came again and finished its work now all is gone sybil had gone over to kate lang's to pass the night to take an early start in the morning for king's ferry as no one washurt she continued her journey mr fisher and lynn saved the machinery in a small out house gussy secreted himself and fired five times at the invaders the pickets ran for their lives april 11th mr linn killed a pig and sent us a piece the first meat we have had in eight days with the exception of a rice bird we were all eager for our supper but the pig was so poor and green that it made us sick i awoke in the night distressed with hives my body was covered with rash all have been busy since the fire picking up nails it is said there are none in the confederacy a few weeks ago they were worth 300 a keg now more mr fisher and john are now hurrying to plant corn the nights are so cold nothing grows fast sybil had a tedious ride to king's ferry kate bought a common calico dress for 120 ten yards merchants prefer to keep their goods until the new issue this banking business is a great swindle people who deposited gold for safekeeping are obliged to give it up for this confederate trash april 13th we went over to kate's in the morning mr fisher took us in his cart as far as the creek i wished to lend them 75.00 but they had no use for it shall probably lose it kate gave us a piece of fresh meat half dozen potatoes and a saucer of fresh butter such a rich day for us i think we must gain some fat mr linn left at noon his furlough was up and he must go leaving his wife in hourly expectation of illness before leaving savannah he bought two pounds of coffee for 30.00 on the road he discovered that someone had given him a paper of peas in exchange he purchased a sack of flour for 125.00 that he had not found when he left here the country is threatened with starvation maj bailey has gone fishing he says he has commenced drawing up our papers a slow process miss chappelle is very impatient april 15th had a dish of boiled rice and dry corn bread for breakfast nothing on it for dinner a soup made of the beef bone that kate gave us with rice and corn bread it is a rainy day and gloomy my thoughts continually at the north i am homesick and i wonder what is my duty in regard to going whether it will be made plain to me it seems as if i could not stay contentedly another year and what shall we live on if we go north it is a question that we cannot solve i can hardly wait for mail day to come and yet we are disappointed week after week now that we have been favored with letters i want them to come thick and fast how long the three last years have been they seem like a vast uncomfortable dream once i wished for a lodge in a vast wilderness i have realized the fallacy of such a wish and now i am led to say oh solitude where are thy charms give me society friendship and love so divinely bestowed upon man i did not appreciate the blessing when i had it and this is a deserved chastisement may i receive it with profit mr fisher is planting corn sybil is scratching in the garden my homemade shoes are too thin to admit of my going out in the wet and so i stay in and think so hard of home oh such a longing to see the girls and partake of their northern comforts once more how little can they realize our forlorn situation april 16yh the day dawns upon us more cheerily out of doors but the weather is still cold for the season had another corn cake and boiled rice for breakfast but grace came over from kate's with a piece of drum fish and a bunch of radishes for dinner which was a great luxury providence does not leave us to starve in the wilderness yet like the israelites we are continually murmuring we have had lettuce twice from our garden all the vegetables are backward and hard to keep from frost crows ground moles hens and other things too numerous to mention we plant and raise here under great difficulties at supper we were obliged to fall back upon the rice and corn april 17th on sabbath mornings we look with great impatience for the mail today a letter came from fred he was in good spirits he had found a pair of saddle bags containing clothing and had found also a pretty girl from virginia he was before palatka in florida and expecting a battle daily we received a paper also drawn up by the camden coites suing general gilmer for a passport for us i do not like it and think i will write for myself no satisfactory news in the papers a dish of lettuce and eggs was added to our corn cake at noon which relished nicely last night was very cold a frost in some places april 18th we were called about 3 o'clock this morning to mrs linn we hurried down but found the boy there before us old nelly was officiating it is a nice fat baby the people here are quite like the israelitish women they hardly give a baby time to turn about this is the fourth baby that we have waited on since the war broke out our mulatto josy is the prettiest baby of the three he is a handsome cunning little fellow clarence claims him as his he says he is going to camp tackle em tattnall this morning to buy him a pony went over to kate's in the afternoon she gave us a basket of radishes and a basket of flower roots maj bailey intends to send our petition to savannah on saturday next yesterday mr fisher succeeded in driving up three cows which gives us about two quarts of milk per day we can now wet our rice and hominy and although it does not taste much like milk it is a valuable acquisition we fare well april 21st we are short on allowance today a saucer of rice and skim milk for dinner we shook a half pint of cream in a glass jar and thus have produced our first butter perhaps a small tea cup full and we are to have some rice cakes for supper gussie has come from camp to help us he says the confederates have burnt mr german's house and mill at king's ferry to prevent the lumber from going to the yankees mrs linn and baby thrive well she has nothing to live on but corn meal and rice but she is very uncomplaining and bears all patiently we are making inquiries of all we see if there is anything in the shape of edibles to be found in the county but nobody knows of anything not a point the pickets are living on field peas and rice and the animals are suffering there is money enough and nothing to buy april 22nd there is a better state of things today kate has sent us a nice piece of beef and mrs linn a piece also the cows are now coming in and we shall fare very well with milk april 23rd we were surprised today by the arrival of fred from florida the regiment have a furlough of a few days and then on to richmond is the word it is thought that the crisis is near that there the event must be decided april 25th fred left today last evening we had a letter from julia and 80.00 for me 35.00 of which i lent fred and 10 to gussie mr fisher is very impatient for his passport the weather is now becoming summer like berries are ripening and the forest is looking fresh and beautiful april 26th killed a pig april 27th we went over to kate's for the mail found her sitting on the front steps dressed in her new calico and knitting she looked very smiling and soon told us that she and the major were married on the previous evening there was not time to send to us or we should have been summoned mr bullock the minister came at night while she was milking the major had been off all day cow hunting after supper the major brushed his hair kate put on her new calico the negroes all gathered about the doors and the knot was tied the children were delighted kate loaded us down with flowers and radishes and we trotted home full of curious emotions hardly describable the major is going to savannah in a day or two and will carry our papers with him april 28th summer is here in earnest thermometer at 90 in the shade major b was over this morning cow hunting he says that mr floyd has taken the papers to savannah had a letter from autie last evening she finds it difficult to procure a passport must write to gen beauregard and thinks we

may 4th a cold time since may came in almost a frost the warm clothing that had been packed away was brought again into use fred came home and gus too to get something to eat the soldiers are poorly fed and we have been living for some days on milk and rice today we had the first peas from the garden and with the addition of a little piece of bacon from kate had a splendid dinner i was very hungry and it tasted good how rich we should feel now if we had plenty of bacon once a despised dish now the greatest luxury may 8th it is growing warm again but the cold weather has made us all sick with severe colds yesterday morning dianah came to my bedside in great distress blood running down her face in breaking a board with an axe a piece flew up and struck her in the eye she lay in bed all day and suffered severly it was a hard day for all john had to cook and he moves like a snail and then the pig that was killed the night before must be taken care of oh how much we miss the negroes if they are poor lazy and saucy fred dressed up in his best and went off about ten miles to a little party gussy went down to the shore and brought home some oysters kate sent me three skeins of cotton yarn to knit we have so little to employ us that we begged to knit for her and are now finishing off the sixth pair of stockings may 15th another sabbath we almost dread them they are such days of idleness and wickedness read letters from ophelia and julia we are so anxious to hear from the north and wonder they do not write oftener everybody there seems flourishing here we are on the last squeeze plenty of confederate money but nothing to buy major bailey intended leaving today for savannah and would attend to our passports a slow process but it may be in time have been nearly sick the past week with my cold when the weather is settled and warm hope to be better of it it is said that so cold a spring had never been known here we still find fires and thick clothing comfortable had i a home how eager i would be to fly i want to go north and have some enjoyment of life once more i am there almost every night in my dreams but the home is always lacking if we go north where shall we go the future is very dark today i am trying to console myself that day must soon dawn everything is so dark when we had our fill of comforts they were not appreciated i did not make a right use of the blessings and now like an unprofitable servant i seem to be cast out as a cumberer of the ground may 15th the bees have been swarming all the month i think there has been twelve new swarms mr fisher and sybil have been badly stung their faces and hands badly swollen may 17th had a letter from julia with 2.00 enclosed saying she had one hundred more for me the amount looks well but where is the value am not able to buy a single article and cannot take it north no one wishes for the money all have more than they want no one has anything to sell all want to buy we could sell the last article from our backs mr fisher had a pair of shoes made by one of the pickets the soles were from the mill belting the vamps from coon skin tanned at home and the quarters of cowhide they are too hard for his sore feet but they will probably sell for about ten dollars his feet are nearly ruined by bad shoes it seems that major bailey did not go to savannah but sent the papers by mail last january was none too early to begin this business the south are full of hope for their cause the accounts we get are certainly not cheering for them may 21st how rejoiced i am had a letter from mary i have held on to it nearly all day and read it i know not how many times how can i stay here any longer it is too irksome if i could i would go today we hear nothing from savannah it is foolish for me to write
june 3rd major bailey sent over for my money as he is going to atlanta to join the army i had the day previous sent 150.00 to savannah to be returned in the new issue but gave him an order to draw it if he wishes june 4th went over for the mail and dined with kate on bacon and string beans a thunder shower came up and she sent us home in the buggy with poor old martha the mule fred returned in the night june 7th dined with kate she wasdisappointed at having no letter from bailey june 12th have been suffering the past week from a strain in my side no letter yet from the north and no passport the prospect is that we must stay another year mrs chappelle must be about starting june 19th after so long a time they send to us from charleston that we cannot leave here unless we run the blockade so we have permission to remain here until the war closes we are getting very destitute of clothing but it is useless to fear for the future we may suffer but many are already suffering it is doubtless better for us to remain here at present under trying circumstances we will hope for the best bailey returned last week on furlough to kate's great happiness a seven days rain has kept us from going over
july 10th nothing further from the north we look for letters in vain ed richardson came home last month from virginia with a wounded heel a ball passed directly through it fred and gussie have both gone to tennessee to join johnston's army they left the 1st of july the whole regiment has gone and we are left to the mercy of the blockaders we only number four men in a region of eight miles and they are lame and decrepit mr fisher is now confined to his bed with a bad abscess in his right breast suffers very much if the enemy come and wish to take us there isnothing to prevent them we went over to kate's yesterday she is complaining mrs smith with six children and one at the breast with a negro came to pass sunday with her hope she will enjoy it
august 2nd last night a small boat came up the river the enemy landed and burned up the house that the pickets occupied they are supposed to be deserters from across the river the pickets in their fright ran to warn maj bailey but left us in happy ignorance until morning we have heard two or three times from the boys they were feeling well but we are constantly anxious the enemy are getting a strong hold on georgia we go to kate's twice a week for the mail it is all the visiting and recreation that we have she seems to enjoy it as well as we and loads us down with good things there is now here a new set of pickets young boys from fourteen and up they are abundantly supplied with melons from our garden we have enough for ourselves and our neighbors were we near a market we could realize a handsome sum as they are selling from 5.00 to 10.00 but no one has any money now the soldiers are gone and besides they are receiving no pay august 21st kate and family have gone to valdosta to visit her mother it is lonely without her we went over yesterday for the mail but heard nothing from the boys it is monotonous here i have no spirit to write some days we are very desponding it seems as if we should never meet with our friends again i hope we may have patience to wait mr linn has been home on a week's furlough his baby was four months old before he had a sight of it it is a pretty child called arthur stuart ed richardson's foot is still very bad but he is obliged to show himself in savannah once in thirty days he is going again tomorrow it is two days journey to the cars and he has nothing but a cart to go in august 22nd we have been startled at last by the appearance of a gunboat the pickets ran in great terror the negroes were sent over to maj bailey's mr fisher drove a cart load of trunks into the woods and then stationed himself where he could watch the doings of the enemy mrs linn sybil and myself were left to receive them mrs linn with her two children seated themselves on the front steps soon eight men came up and immediately surrounded the house and inquired for richardson he fortunately had left that morning for savannah they could not take mrs linn's word but searched the house sybil ran down thinking that mrs linn might be frightened and met six more at the gate the result was that we were taken by the gunboat with only a few moments warning and sent north where we arrived after 19 days cruising on the 11th of september 1864

hoped to have gotten off to tenn very soon but bro wilson's overseer resigned his place expecting the company he joined to be ordered off so it will put off our movement in the direction of home

night as it passed up don't know why while at dinner heard the drum beating found the boat hope was coming with a company from yazoo city on it they seem to be very happy with the thought of doing their duty although i only know 3 that were members of the company i could not but feel sad when i wondered how many of that number would return to homes friends bro wilson's overseer the messrs waddell were the ones i knew what a depressed feel weighed down my heart as their voices grew fainter fainter as they rounded the bend in the river and their shouts cheers ceased to be heard i could not for sometime shake off the gloomy feeling i knew though their faces were wreathed with smiles it was a masque for sad hearts may god be with them prosper our cause that their blood may not be spilled in vain this evening the man henry returned from the city where he had been after our mail brought sister mary a long interesting letter from pa in which he stated the home guard company numbered about a hundred and would be called out in an emergency that bro will had joined a company that there was one making up in bro john's neighborhood and that legrand as young as he is wanted to go off with a company great great excitement prevails the teachers from soule college two were dismissed 3 resigned annie ransom lucy leiper took the music teachers places if i had been home would've offered my services pa says he is afraid the college will be broken up i am glad the men of tenn are turning out so bravely in the defense of their homes i leave them in the hands of providence may he be with them saturday may 5th 1861 it rained a part this morning we walked out this afternoon i fed the deer received a long letter from fannie wilson today monday 6th 1861 it rained a little just

flying in the breeze mr norton one of the yandell overseers told bro wilson they received a letter from cousin john today that he was better satisfied he will soon forget us all well we can't help it

fred wheeles left not long after dinner then tommy g little fred wheeles went down to mr fred wheeles with miss olivia who intends going to a picnic tomorrow mr w said he was commissioned to invite all the young ladies but i have not the most distant idea of attending don't suppose there will be but one beau that will be mr cannon as he is miss olivia's star i suppose she will monopolize his company as all believe he is addressing her i went home with old mrs wheeles miss mary mrs robberts spent the night mrs brooks her little daughter were also there they had started up to see us but concluded it was too late to come but said she would be up soon after we returned to tenn her daughter remained all night with fannie wheeles
may 7th 1862 a lovely day has passed but unappreciated our minds being in such a disturbed state we expected finie burton kate marchbanks out to see us probably to spend the day but were disappointed in both as they failed to come we also looked for tommie jones he may have left as he did not call i suppose he found an opportunity of slipping away in the great excitement of today went bettie had several letters to send to clarksville by him shall have to mail them now yesterday evening he called on bettie afterwards asked for me it was the first time i ever saw him as much as i can judge liked him very well indeed found nothing to dislike about him still nothing very striking it was while he was here i heard for the first time of will rucker will wilkinson taking the oath which i must acknowledge was no little surprise to me or as some would express it i was thunder struck for i thought their pride would have revolted at anything so base cowardly bettie i had made two handsome bouquets to send them but were prevented which i am thankful as they are so detestable as to take that oath this morning ma was going to take our boys that are prisoners their breakfast but thinking so many would send provisions and as she sent them good many nice things yesterday the first strawberries we had were taken to them i would give up my share any time for our poor soldiers nothing would be considered too great a sacrifice on my part for their good or comfort before i had eaten my breakfast mrs mollie crockett sent out for me to send some flowers for a young lady to send to tom morgan brother of john morgan as he is among our prisoners at the jail i had quite a handsome one made but i am afraid he had not the pleasure of receiving it as they are not going to allow our men to receive such demonstrations of sympathy as were expressed by the ladies of murfreesboro ma took them up some comforts and bedding last evening poor fellows they were thing's left here that belonged to the hospital she also took some clothes up to tom morgan as she understood he was in need of some she carried bettie's my bouquets up to some of the boys when old capt frost who by the way comes out quite frequently since pa arrest which was three weeks last tuesday he is ever a welcome visitor as he is better than any newspaper and seems so disturbed about pa he brought a message from mr crossman who is a union man though we think a very clever one and is staying for protection which we are very glad to have him do as he carries letters to pa or any thing else or getting a pass for ma to have hauled wood from the quarter to have sold it is a mutual accommodation satisfies all parties bettie i give him some hard cuts though about people taking the oath well to return to the message he sent ma that she must neither send or carry anything to the prisoners today for if she did the yankees might insult her she and cousin ann would not take them when they first went up but afterwards sent back after some clothes said she could have them sent in secretly when they came back they brought the same old tale that we must prepare for a battle as one was expected here before night it seems as if it was always bad news so without more ado about the matter i went upstairs and began packing my trunk but before i finished dinner came on with it mr crossman but brought no news he is afraid of committing himself to us for fear our secession tongues would get us into trouble as he is of the opinion that we talk too much scarcely had we gotten up from the table when we saw mrs kittie reeves her grandson levi coming at the same time heard the band of music coming played by rogues as that is what i call the yankees more appropriate than any thing else we saw also about 2 thousand yankees tramping down the lebanon pike to my astonishment stopped in the grove opposite our house owned by uncle wm lytle thinking they had come down to drill i went in and slammed the door had every blind in the house shut that they might know i would not condescend to see them drill i also called all servants and children in said sufficiently loud for them to hear that i didn't want anyone to see them but to our astonishment they stacked arms and seemed to be waiting for something on enquiry found they were expecting prisoners from lebanon soon our yard was filling with yankees asking for flowers to all ma said help yourselves well knowing they were going to do it which i guess was the best way but i should have refused scarcely had they begun when they heard that the other men with our men prisoners were coming but i had enough flowers to tie up three bouquets bettie gillespie had gotten some also we did not have to wait long after getting down to the fence on the pike before we saw our poor boys being brought along with as much pomp show as possible there were about 5,000 to guard less than a hundred of our men our men looked so noble had such a manly bearing that they looked less like prisoners than those that had them in charge i forgot i was before so many men especially when i began to see my old friends among them i told them never to take the oath they answered that had played out and a great many other things that enraged the yankees very much after i saw jessie sikes george ridley mr roberts i scarcely knew what i did do i know when i screamed a whole camp hissed at me but what i cared for that i was perfectly insensible to any feeling save sympathy for our prisoners an officer ordered us to the house but contrary to military rules regulations we did not go until we got ready good many cursed us when we hurrahed for jeff davis john morgan beauregard but we heard very little of it until an old man that wanted to pick up our flowers that we had thrown to our soldiers when we said he must not have them because they were confederate flowers he cursed me kicked them i have since been sketching him for bettie's benefit and for our entertainment tonight as we are sitting up until three our four o'clock as they have threatened to burn our house tonight but seeing no prospect of a fire went to bed slept very comfortably an officer rode up and offered to buy one of my bouquets i suppose as an insult i told him he could never get one for any consideration but if he had been a confederate soldier he would be welcome so the chap rode off charley marchbanks col wood were also in the lot of prisoners i was so much excited i did not recognize them they were sent off on the train this afternoon mrs kittie reeves left shortly after we came up to the house mrs edwards came over staid awhile this afternoon cousin ann ma went to town in the buggy but did not get to see any of the prisoners thursday may the 8th 1862 another beautiful day cousin william tilford came to see ma had decided to go to nashville to see pa she is to give her answer in a day or two mr staley lady called out on ma cousin ann this morning bettie i went up to see kate marchbanks to console her about her brother i feel quite sorry for her she seems much distressed on our way back met capt frost who stopped us had quite a little chat passed a yank further down turned off my head as i always do now ma cousin ann rode up to town this evening while they were gone a yank came after milk i let pricy give him two glasses of milk for i will not go into see any of them mr avent came out said pa would be home today or tomorrow it is too good for us to believe we had a long letter from him today by mrs troadway we had a large bowl of fresh strawberries today how i do wish our poor boys could get some mr crossman expects one of his friends out here today to stay it is rumored we have had another big battle i hope my friends are safe friday may 9th 1862 pa mr wendle are coming home tomorrow i'm so glad ma went up to town this morning cousin will tilford aunt maney mcfarlin took dinner here today the latter took the oath today the former took it some time ago there was an old lady came here today by the name of mrs jones that refused to take the oath said the yankees might blow her brains ou t bury them before she would take it as she had 3 sons 7 grandsons in the southern army hurrah for her it is rumored that jeff thompson is in ky may 10th 1862 not a more beautiful day could have been selected than this is it would have been splendid for a bridal one if we were influenced altogether by outward circumstances or appearances we would be the happiest of happy pa is coming home and we are delighted but not more so than he is as he has been a prisoner in the penitentiary ever since the 15th of last month away from his family ma jennie helen went over to the depot to meet him mr christy mr rickhammer came out to see him mrs henderson mrs levi reeves called this afternoon also but being very busy preparing the table for nicie's wedding supper she is an old family servant that is to be married did not see any of them we have been quite busy all day the table was set in our dining room and quite a pretty one too it was she was married in the front hall by uncle brack their colored preacher everything passed off very nicely ada emma ledbetter kate marchbanks dick ledbetter were out and sat until bed time with us mr buck duffer was also up here saw the ceremony performed mr crossman went to nashville today sunday the 11th 1862 it has been a beautiful day rather warm cousin ann bettie the only two that attend church today they did not return until late in the evening mr john bell jr mr peter duffer capt frost came out to see pa this morning in the afternoon mr boles his daughter bell came out they had not been gone long when mr mrs david wendle two daughters came out to see pa the rest of us mr crossman came up from nashville today he brought me a letter from lucy wilson which i must answer very soon monday may 12th 1862 the sky above is cloudless but our even tenor of our way has been some what interrupted by the arrest of some of our best and most worthy citizens messrs dromgoole our mayor jas avent jno a crockett tom robberson wm ransom maj childress rev g t henderson maj maney to get dr baskett and there is no knowing who will be next for it seems though most polite are the first arrested i verily believe if a person did not open his mouth they would have them taken up on suspicion of his having looked contrary to his established rules poor maj maney see the kimberly letters for more on the maney family in occupied tennessee walked home with pa partook of a social class little dreaming that he would be among the number taken so soon he with the rest of those gentlemen were in the store congratulating pa on his safe arrival home little thinking that in a few hours they would be in a like situation this is called a land of freedom it is sacreligious to call this oppress and down trodden nation a land of liberty where tyranny stalks in open day private grudges of years standing are brought to light revenge is considered sweet it seems strange that when a certain man for i shall not term him a gentleman sees fit to go to nashville a number of our good men are taken away surely justice will over take him yet though it may be slow for our father that watches over us in secret will not let a wicked man prosper if he fails to be punished in this world he will one day stand before the great tribunal there receive his reward we scarcely have a thought much more open our mouths for fear pa will again be sent to prison for he mr wendel are both bound over 10,000 each though i'm not inclined to anticipate evil i feel quite confident that he will have it to pay for i think there are tools low enough for any work they would be willing to swear falsely if gold could be gotten by so doing as bill spence has a quantity of money that he has gotten by robbing the widows orphans poor even to the servants he will not lack means to pay his workman should they agree to do the dirty work of swearing falsely especially if his conscience hurts him he would like some means of getting rid of his ill gotten gains in the papers it is stated that jeff davis has appointed the 16th of this month for prayer for the protection of our army the southern confederacy but i have no idea it will be allowed to be noticed here but we can pray all the more at home they can't deprive us of our thoughts though i have no doubt they would if they could we will certainly know how to appreciate freedom when we have it once more restored bettie and i got a scolding for our long tongues just before supper at that meal we were as quiet as little mice though we got no praise for our uncommon nice behavior conversation was a drag they looked as if they wished us to say something though we kept provokingly quiet and seemed intent on enjoying our strawberries and soon after it was over came to our room to chat to ourselves without interruption from our dear prudent parents with some of their sage advice ma was up town this morning brought the news that sister amanda had a little daughter born last thursday so i have a little niece a little nephew also that i have not seen yet we heard the yankees were going to take in their pickets if that be true i can go out to see them both but i think it must have been a false report it has been that they entertained such an idea but hearing that kentucky was rebelling coming to join the south since the emancipation law has been passed in congress that we were fighting in cumberland gap that john morgan had captured two trains of cars one containing a safe with much money supposed to be in it i hope the day is breaking for us at last capt frost mr pricket were both out here awhile this evening little laura davis laura ledbetter came out this evening after a piece or two of music for kate marchbanks addie ledbetter it is growing late cousin ann i know is getting anxious for me to extinguish the light so i will prepare for bed hoping to sleep the sleep of the innocent while the moon with its broad face keeps a good humored watch over me tuesday may 13th 1862 the citizens that were arrested yesterday were sent off on the train to nashville including dr s basket king robert wendle leaving quite a small number of physicians in town and i don't know what we would do if the small pox should break out for it is already here we know of two cases among the yankees and there is no telling how many more there are that we do not know about they had these two cases placed in a house on main st and gave out they were sick confederates thinking the ladies of the place would flock to see them sure enough one lady went was much frightened as well as shocked when she found what was the matter with them some thought the yankees took that means to spread it through out this place cousin henry tilford ate dinner with us today said he had lost his pass they refused to give him another that is what he gets for taking the oath bettie jennie i went over to mrs lewis maney while there mrs hancocke miss annie murfree also mrs david maney miss sallie belle we came away soon after the latter arrived met helen just at the fence persuaded her to return home with us we then concluded to walk up to see mrs henderson but we saw about 20 armed ruffians coming down the street so we concluded to stop in to see mrs pritchet as we have been intending paying them a visit for some time we had just started to go when several of those scoundrels came to search the house i gave them a most scornful look passed out they searched every house in town got a few old shot guns an old pistol from here but should they attempt loading it as it is now woe be unto them which i hope they will do as i saw an officer this evening riding down the street trying to show off i wished from the bottom of my heart the horse would throw him break his neck i can't believe it is much of a sin either but must we blame the yankees for trying to show off when some young ladies were out on horse back also trying to cut a dash without even an escort i sent them word they had better mind or the yanks would insult them for it was the misses duffers i don't know how they took the message i don't care when we arrived at aunt tildy henderson's the soldiers were ransacking her house pretending to search she looked very sad but who could be otherwise here now for it seems the silver lining to the dark cloud that hovers over our land will never be seen the news came that norfolk portsmouth have fallen into the hands of the enemy that our gun boat merrimack was blown up by our own people to help it from falling into the hands of the federals if something almost a miracle is not done soon we shall have to yield our hearts up to despair wednesday may 14th 1862 it was a pretty morning until about one o'clock when all of a sudden it looked as if we were going to have a terrible storm but it contented itself with a nice little shower and stopped ma cousin ann went up town and while there went by the hospital to see our two wounded soldiers that were brought in yesterday ma took them nice strawberries cream nice flour hoecakes butter bettie i sent a lovely bouquet to mr henderson for which he returned a nice little note of thanks miss millie mclain called on bettie this morning mr crossman went to nashville this evening took a letter for lucy wilson from me enclosing one from kate marchbanks the paper called the dispatch was surpressed today suppose the reason was it told the truth too plain said that beauregard had not left corinth had no idea of doing so but instead had been strongly reinforced the yanks expecting morgan every time they go out to stand guard carry one of the citizen's without permitting them to have arms thinking i suppose if morgan does attack the town he will be prevented from firing on them by the unarmed citizen being there i hope morgan will hear of it bro john was slightly wounded in his little finger at pittsburgh landing thursday may 15th 1862 bettie i drove up in the buggy with andrew behind we arrived at home safe after my driving though i know little about it went to see mrs winship who is dying with consumption also mrs leiper by the store arriving home about 11 or 12 o'clock stemmed strawberries for dinner a nice large bowl for our two wounded confederate soldiers that are still in the hospital ma cousin ann took them up to them this afternoon one of the soldiers said he was looking for his mother soon ma told him to tell her to make our house her home while she remained i was lying down reading all of the afternoon three yanks were passing by trying to get some flowers from over the fence when ma went out and gave them some they came in the house pa treated them bettie i were upstairs in the hall and was much amused at what they had to say as we could hear their conversation from below two of the scamps came again tonight to call on pa friday may 16th 1862 today was the fast day appointed by jeff davis and we kept it until dinner though we had no service in our churches it seems hard that we are not permitted to pray to god when and how we want to ma received a letter from sister mary today written about a month ago by an underground railroad as they term it we were delighted to learn they were so well haven't been very well today slept a little during the day consequently did not rest well tonight mr crossman returned from nashville today failing to see any of mrs wilson family i didn't get an answer to my letter several yankees came into ma's yard she gave them flowers ma cousin ann went up to the hospital to take our prisoners some nice things to eat capt round's commanded them to come no more he is a villain clothed with a little brief authority he flatters his little soul he is somebody but did he but know we have heard he was only a drummer martha duffer spent the night with rosa saturday may 17th 1862 rather warm today i feel some better today bettie i grew very much excited at a remark made by mr crossman about our president jeff davis he is nothing but an old union man anyway promised if we would write letters south he would try and get them through though should i write as i feel he would not send them if i wrote otherwise they would be little satisfaction either to those written to or myself capt frost was out a little while this evening told us a good deal of news said our men had cut a bridge near huntsville just so that it would stay up and a large body of yankees went to cross was precipitated into the river hope the last one was killed he also said that we had 75,000 men in 40 miles of this place too good to be true we are so often disappointed now mrs tom johnson several of her children were here awhile this evening sunday may 18th 1862 a lovely day has passed cousin ann bettie helen went to church this morning mr crossman went to nashville regretted i didn't know of his going in time i would have written a letter to some of the wilson family ma sent sister mary's letter to mrs wilson to read ma pa jennie went down to see uncle william lytle this evening pa went up to mr dromgoole's he has been released from prison for a few days on account of his ill health mr henderson came up with him but will have to return very soon maj childress is up on a six days furlough heard that mr hoard was in earnest a union man that mr t o butler had signed the paper for our state to return to her old allegiance but i hope i have been misinformed two yanks came here and asked for some flowers i told leathy the servant she might get them some for i don't speak to them one of them seem to be very much pleased with her she tied them each a bouquet they gave her each 5 cents for her trouble she told them ma never sold flowers one of them asked helen was she a secessesh she said yes indeed she was capt frost was out here late this evening staid a little while monday may 19th 1862 cousin ann spent the day with mrs winship mollie crockett mrs jno a crockett were out calling this morning several letters were received in town from their distant friends written in high spirits bettie and i walked down to see mrs edwards this evening ma cousin ann went up to the hospital to see our confederate soldiers and carried them flowers and strawberries tuesday may 20th 1862 trimmed the children's hats today don't feel very well tonight ma went up town this evening this evening took a careful list of those union men heard that mr butler said they put his name to it without his agreeing to it i hope it is a mistake about his being a union man heard it was a mistake about the merrimac either being taken or burnt or sunk was quite sick for a while just before i retired wednesday may 21st 1862 rained for sometime then cleared off proved a pretty day dr wendle vaccinated several of the children this evening cousin kate mccultong several children rode out here awhile this evening i sewed on cousin ann's quilt this morning went out helped to make a cake then got ready to see cousin tabitha morgan but cousin ann i went to the store and i asked tally about putting his name to the paper requesting the state go back into the union he seemed proud of it when i first asked him but i gave him such a big piece of my mind and talked so fast he couldn't say much we met pa going home when we came up so i had a good time raking tally over about being a union man poor pa looks so sad is growing so sad i feel so sorry to see him look that way i have noticed more this week than ever before since that old dog capt round insulted him last monday when he asked for a pass he threw down his pen saying as he did so that taking the oath was the only condition of pa's getting a pass the rascal i would love to see him hung he old bill spence a number of others feel no regret cousin ann i stopped at mrs anderson's a few moments then went around to mrs leiper's on our way stopped talked a little with aunt nancy then by mrs bole's talked a little stopped a short while at mrs henderson's then came home i would not be surprised if i was not shortly arrested for my long tongue o how i do hope our confederacy may be victorious in the end i can't conceive of defeat being possible what would i do if the last spark of hope was extinct thursday may 22nd 1862 bettie spent the day up town mrs crossman came up from nashville this evening rev mr staley took dinner with us today ma went up today to see our two prisoners took them some nice things to eat heard that they were fighting in corinth also that elisiah childress bettie c's brother had died poor child i feel so sorry for her she always seemed so devoted to him the yankees say it would not surprise them if we have a battle here in less than 48 hours i sent a bouquet to eliza nelson one to cousin tabitha morgan today a bowl of strawberries to aunt unclear snell friday may 23rd 1862 this morning two yankees came here and asked for pa some flowers ma gave them flowers but pa not being here they did not see him they spoke of lincoln calling out one hundred thousand more men ma says do you suppose you will get them o yes they replied we can get them from tenn ky i suppose they anticipated drafting those that have taken the oath i hope they will place in the front ranks every one of the traitors that have taken the oath all those gentlemen that were arrested returned home today with the exception of maj ledbetter col ready mr dromgoole said the latter was looking badly i did not see any of them that returned ma cousin ann saw mr henderson they went up to the college to see our prisoners and to their astonishment found that one had taken the oath and gone home just to think he was one of morgan's men too i felt so badly about it but heard his wife was at the point of death like it was that that forced him to take it the yankees no doubt will publish that not less than a dozen took the oath in place of mr handley oh i hope the other poor fellow will not do such a thing i felt so wretched when i have placed confidence in any one it is betrayed by taking that awful oath bettie i went to see finie burton but she was not at home talked a while to her mother she spoke of trying to get a pass to go out but old rounds said he had charged the pickets to let no one out but to permit the country people to come go we think it is a yankee trick to get them in to take the oath he said they were stricter every day i hope his glory will soon be over for he has already done enough meanness we went to mrs keeble's did not find miss sue brady but saw mrs nattie keeble mrs brady while sitting there talking saw old rounds ride by on mr menefee's horse he had stolen just riding it about in open day puts on airs as if he was somebody at home but the way he treats ladies everybody knows he is nothing called at mrs dromgoole's on herself helen her daughter mrs mooney and mrs staley our methodist minister's wife after going away from there passed miss helen mcvain's house the old academy saw lilly brown sitting out talking to a yankee officer mrs settle children baggage left town got beyond the line's without the yankees finding it out until too late to stop her hope she will make her way safe expect mr settle was some where near ma received a note from sister maria she said when she heard from bro will he was sick down at sister mary's every body is expecting a fight here in town saturday may 24th 1862 it was drizzling rain this morning but it soon cleared off i was in hopes it would have proved a disagreeable day so the country people would have been prevented coming in town to hear old andy johnson speak i heard he had very few to hear him speak most of them were soldiers which i was glad of an old friend of pa's was to see him today a mr hall he wouldn't stay long said he wanted to leave town before they began speaking he is the gentleman who was so kind to our two friends the dr's tiddings of ky they have staid a long time with him after they left here they have joined morgan but for a long time they could not make their escape they can boast of many narrow escapes they have had when they return home especially the one they had here uncle tom turner has been here today a remarkably prudent man won't say a word scarcely said sister amanda heard from bro jno a short time since he was well but bro will was sick down at sister mary's in miss and that legrand was not well they were all in the fight down at pittsburgh landing sister amanda is not going to name her daughter until bro jno gets back home cousin henry tilford was out here also today rosa spent last night at uncle avent's kate returned with her this morning going to spend the night with her sallie harriet wendle came out to see the children this evening bettie i walked down in the lot met mrs camp that told us her husband had been discharged from our army on account of ill health but she wanted it kept a secret for fear he would be arrested said she could not tell any thing but if pa would go down to see him that he could get all the news she asked permission for her horse to stay in the lot and i told her i guessed it might but would ask pa and it was all right and he told the servants not to turn it out ma then got pa to go down to see him he said our boys were all in high spirits that they had enough provisions to last them a year that troops daily flocked to our army at corinth there was no danger of our boys being defeated he also said morgan had raised 10,000 men from ky it was thought he had recaptured his prisoners that were taken in lebanon it is certainly cheering to hear such good news for inside the lines here we seldom ever see only the dark side of the picture bettie and i were sitting out on the front steps when we saw some men coming up but it was so dark we could not distinguish who they were but when we found it was not pa coming from mr camp's run in and shut the door ma stepped to the door and on finding it was strangers stepped back got a light lo behold it was that little yankee from the convalescent hospital that came up and told ma when pa was arrested that it was negro news wanted to know about her money i firmly believe if he had thought that ma had had money in the house he would have robbed her he wanted ma to pay him to get pa out of jail said he was a pittsburgh lawyer he wanted mr tally to make out a bill and receipt it so he could go to the government officer make him pay it when mr tally refused he swore he would get as much money out of that old government as possible meaning the u s it was he and two others i guess of the same stamp one was a capt the other had some office i don't know what pa came after awhile still they staid on when supper was announced they went in although they said they had taken theirs before the came i suppose they thought they would get to see us go off and report that we had received them but only pa ma cousin ann went in to supper they asked for music both before and after supper but i would cut my hands off before i would play for yanks i thought it was a great piece of impertinence in that little chap bringing those others up here to hear music as he said just as if we dare not refuse to see them the very idea i hope i will die before i am found receiving a yankee they said they had never received a single kind word from any one in murfreesboro had no sympathy for secession how can they look for kindness when they have come to take every thing away from the citizens down south ruin every thing we hold dear sunday may 25 1862 a bright beautiful day i accompanied cousin ann bettie to the presbyterian church before we got to church met jimmie leiper who said one of their regt's had been ordered off just after service began the yanks got up and left i was glad mr eagleton reproved them though i've heard since they received marching orders had to leave all the churches just as we got to the corner met their band in full blast escorting andy johnson to the depot that craven hearted villain i deliberately turned my back and would not look at him although there were officers standing very near mrs leiper was standing out at her corner and said a short time before she was badly frightened thought we were going to have a battle here but learned all the fuss was about that old traitor we met cousin tabitha morgan lucy leiper and chatted with them they dropped in at aunt nancy's to see how she was to hear the news but did not sit down i wanted to tell the good news i heard last night but feared it might cause the arrest of mr camp kate marchbanks stopped to talk with us and related a funny instance that happened there the day before a drunken yankee called to one of her servants and said are you for the south or north she said south laura davis asked her why she didn't say for jeff davis which so enraged the drunken yankee he jumped over the fence rushed in the house saying he considered the ladies under arrest but mrs anderson said she did not so consider herself and sent off after a guard when he found it was coming he said he would withdraw if mrs anderson would take back what the children had said say she was for the union which she refused to do he would withdraw himself the guards coming carried off the individual to jail 9 or 10 yankees came here pa gave them as many cherries as they wanted to eat mr crossman came up from nashville today no news of course with him this afternoon we were lying down when we saw ma come tipping upstairs with mysterious air which i could not make out i rushed out on the back porch as i was undressed and saw ma pass through with a what proved afterwards a confederate soldier she seemed greatly excited he was one of our soldiers that had escaped jail just half an hour ago ma was trying to disguise him so as to let him escape he changed his clothes and shaved off his whiskers ma giving him some of pa's clothes making him look like quite a different man ma carried him up something to eat he would not eat much said he had been to dinner would not take any more money he had plenty i hope he will get safely back to starn's cavalry he said we had 5,000 men just above here had had a fight we killed 30 or 40 yankees it was that night he was taken prisoner that was the first time we had heard of the engagement they always keep a defeat such a secret this soldier came very near being discovered there were three yanks in the front hall who said they had come up to make ma's acquaintance as they heard ma fed their prisoners when morgan captured them when our escaped prisoner asked for the master of the house the servant asked him in to the front hall lo behold there sat the man that had captured him a few nights before and not having any suspicions they took no notice of him he asked ma for some water and then told his story so ma had to play a double game make herself agreeable to the yankees whilst getting our soldier off i felt vastly relieved when he got off safe ma went up town this evening kate avent returned with her home cousin william tilford wife daughter stopped by made a visit awhile this afternoon an old sick yankee came here this evening late pa had his sympathies aroused and consented to let him stay all night made me so angry io cried until bedtime would not eat any supper he was put into poor legrand's room to sleep just to think he may be lying out on the wet ground wet hungry and sick then for his enemy enjoying his room i didn't like it one bit monday may 26th 1862 bettie i would not go down to breakfast until the yankee was through pa tried to joke me about my early rising but i was so mortified i didn't have much to say i made up my mind if the yankee remained to insult him before dinner but he shaved left poor mr camp was arrested last night paroled until morning going to be sent to the penitentiary today i feel so sorry for him though he might have known he would have been arrested the yankees say joe duffer who has deserted told on him but he declares he did not got ma to go down to mrs camp and explain it but she still believes he did bettie i staid in our room nearly all day fannie maney was over to see rosa awhile this afternoon cousin ann and ma went several places today before they returned kate marchbanks sent for us to come up and spend the night which we did enroute met pa and he advised us to be very prudent in our remarks as he got it from good authority that the ladies were all soon to be arrested fanny burton took supper at mrs anderson's went home tonight we were all in fine spirits hoping soon to be liberated from the foreign foe tuesday may 27th 1862 a lovely day kate bettie tuppie anderson myself went to several stores at last went to pa's saw mrs wendle also ellen spence come in the door but we did not speak tally seems to take a great delight in telling me bro will had gotten home one side paralyzed i don't know what i said i was so angry though as i didn't attract attention supposed i must have behaved lady like came by told mrs anderson good bye on my way home met pa who confirmed the bad news i don't know what i should do if deprived of shedding tears i believe go crazy why didn't he die before returning to bring eternal disgrace on the family he has ever been a draw back i could have stood him dying so much better but i know bro john will not take the oath i had rather our throats cut or turned beggars on the world than that bro john should disgrace himself by taking that dirty oath how little brother will thinks of his family it will ever be a stain on his poor little children i blame mr butler as much as i do him for he tried to hide him then to think sent for bill spence the last man in the world one he could not have given more pleasure than to have had to take the oath bill spence said he would have revenge on ma for treating him so i think he certainly has had it i hope he will not be long spared to do much more mischief wednesday may 28th 1862 a lovely day until very late in the evening when it began to cloud up i have been feeling quite bad all day quite weak from not eating any thing since breakfast at mrs anderson's yesterday morning i drank a cup of coffee which is all i have taken today on my stomach pa brought home still worse news said uncle ephe brother john were both coming home that the southern confederacy was looking very dark i know one thing bro john will never come home bettie told me pa said so i haven't been down stairs since i came up yesterday morning pa thinks it is contrariness on my part because he spoke so cross yesterday to me but i have no appetite for anything i feel so miserable i've been looking for william carney family in town all day hope i may never see him again i do wish he would never come here while i'm an inmate of this house cousin ann spent the day up town it has begun to rain i doubt whether she can come home or not mrs leiper mrs ransom cousin tabitha morgan came out here this evening as i could not go downstairs cousin tabitha came up to see me she talked so kind and told me so much good news since she left my heart has felt a little lighter said the militia had all been called out from the northern states that the people were all rising up in maryland they thought washington would soon be in our hands i'm afraid to rejoice for fear it is not true william carney was in town with tommie but did not come out here glad of it but they say he is coming tomorrow to spend the night hope it is not true for i don't want to see him cousin ann came home after the rain didn't feel hungry so ate no supper thursday may 29th 1862 rather warm today remained up in my room until supper or rather until the sun was down i've felt quite unwell all day only ate a biscuit drank a cup of coffee for breakfast the first i have eaten since i came home from mrs anderson's i did not eat any dinner didn't feel like it william carnet was in town today on his way out met rev eagleton brought him out in his buggy i did not see them heard that william looked as well as they ever saw him i hope he will regret taking that oath i wish there was no blood in his vein that is in mine cousin kate mccolloch children spent the day here but i did not see them sue brady called out here this evening bettie went out riding in the barouche with her that old yankee frenchman came staid until after dinner although no one paid him any attention maj ledbetter col ready got back from nashville today on two weeks parole i am glad they have gotten back even for so short a time it is reported the federals are fortifying nashville in a hurry i am glad to hear that as they must certainly be expecting an attack of our men i heard that mary spence accompanied old andy johnson out to her uncle billy spence's the night of the union meeting remained over night and returned as he came in the next morning she is the miss that says if the people of murfressboro don't stop talking about bill spence he will make them suffer for it hurrah for her i forgot to mention in here about a grand parade they had one day over a little secession flag they got from some private family pretended as if they had gotten it in a fight tied it to the mane of one of their horses dragged the flag strewed flowers where the flag went along that was a contemptible act equaled only by the arrest of mr winship to make him look at their union flag that mrs matilda spence and her niece mary made them just because he helped raise the confederate flag when it was first hoisted in our town but he would not look up but smoked away like he didn't care a fig for all of them their old flags friday may 30th 1862 william carney family did not come in as we expected but he was in town very boozy fell out of a buggy but got sober enough to go home this evening or rather to mr butler's where his wife is now i haven't seen him speak to him yet only caught a glimpse of him as he passed out the other day he says jno butler has made him lieut col of his regt am glad to hear it he is a clever fellow deserves to succeed aunt judy lytle kate eat dinner with us today but did not

penitentiary sunday may 31st 1862 rather warm today aunt judy lytle came by left cousin mary johnny here to dinner while she took me out to see sister amanda with her pass i was rather uneasy for fear

sleepy the guards didn't say a word to me i got home safely after an hour or two's visit out at uncle tommie's cousin mary is going to remain with us aunt judy johnny went home that same old french

sunday june 1st 1862 cousin ann went up to see mrs winship remaining all day and night except a few moments she came back this afternoon poor mrs winship cannot last very long she is rapidly sinking

1862 cousin ann still at mrs winship's tonight sister maria william children came in this morning cousin mary with us yet ma went up town this afternoon with sister maria she is looking quite sad

maria went up town this morning in the afternoon ma several of the children went up in town for awhile we had quite a quiet time it rained a little just at night heard that george wilkinson had been promoted to lt glad to hear it the yankees don't know what to make of beaureguard's movements it is thought to be a grand maneuver on his part the yankees expected a battle last night although they missed having it don't suppose it was an unpleasant disappointment especially if we had as many men as they had heard that old parkhurst was taken prisoner but this evening heard it contradicted wednesday june 4th 1862 rather warm this evening cloudy a little rain cousin ann still at mrs winship's william family still here reported they the troops were fighting in two miles of town which proved to be a mistake report says beaureguard has whipped them at corrinth badly there is something about a fight in richmond mary lookie duffer called to see bettie i today thursday june 5th 1862 mrs hancocke miss annie murfree were out here calling this morning cousin ann came home from mrs winship's this morning bettie jennie went up there staid a while ma cousin ann went up town staid a while this evening the yankee dr came out to see the old frenchman this evening we think he will be moved tomorrow glad of it the report is our troops are very near here beauregard is still lost no one knows where he is old round's wife has arrived i understand going to board at mrs kitty reeves i think every body ought to be cut that pay attention to yankees william his son tommy spent the day in the country friday june 6th 1862 sister maria cousin ann were up town this morning william went out to his place going to remain all night old round's wife arrived today good news understand we have troops at woodberry hope it is true then we will soon be released from the rule of this villainous set frenchman was not removed two of his friends came to see him from my window one of them looked a good deal like john butler though not so good looking it would not surprise me any time to find our town in the midst of a battle heard that mr roberts that was taken prisoner made his escape from nashville by dressing in ladie's clothes glad of it wish more of them would get away jessie sikes george riddley charley marchbanks others finished reading the autocrat of the breakfast table saturday june 7th 1862 cousin ann i rode up to see mrs winship this morning while up town heard good news that a hundred yankees went out to readyville were all either captured or killed except eleven we came by the store they had heard the same story aunt nancy seeing the buggy had to come tell us the good news every body is rejoicing called by to see belle boles her mother they told us a good deal of news had a pleasant little visit she said kate marchbanks had received a letter from her brother he said all the boys fell in love with bettie i for talking so bravely to the yankees as we climbed up on the fence the day they were prisoners it had just the opposite effect from what i expected i was afraid they would think us quite silly we hope andy johnson will be cut off as he returns to shelbyville where there was a union meeting today cousin henry tilford wife children three two twins took dinner here we like his wife very much her oldest little boy is very much like bro jno's little legrand eliza nelson came out spent nearly the whole afternoon told us a secret said uncle ephe men were very near here that jno morgan also the yankees are expecting an attack are fortifying out near their camps ma was up town this evening cousin ann is spending the night with mrs winship kate avent spent the day here rosa is spending the night with her sunday june 8th 1862 cousin ann came home this morning bettie went up to mrs winships spent the day mrs winship is some better mr winship mary lytle rode home with her in the evening aunt judy was in town but did not come out the yankees were all paroled that were taken except one gray that is a second bill spence that betrayed bob nelson tom morgan besides taking pa's horses bro will's horses ma says if stams captured her horses from the yankees he is welcome to them old gray is to be shot i expect it makes many hearts feel glad he is the same individual that ordered our wagons from the farm to bring down some old union families into the yankee lines they released gray's son which i'm sorry as i didn't expect he is much better than his father one of the yankees to dr murfree's fine horse been riding it about as if it belonged to him they arrested dr baskett mr jas avent today without a charge preferred against them which is perfectly outrageous mrs avent children went down to nashville today we don't know where they will send them i'm glad so many of their men were killed and wounded if they would return home not interfere with us our government i would not wish them so much evil but as long as they stay here i am going to wish them all the harm i can rosa returned from aunt nancy's this morning mr rosenfield came up to tell ma some good news took a cup of coffee with us as he had been to supper several yankees came up to see the old frenchman today pa wrote a note up the hospital for them to come after him but they did not monday june 9th 1862 rather cool for this time of year miss angie wheeler whom i met at mrs winship's after cousin ann said her pa said this weather reminded him of the time the cholera was so bad here it was holiday for andrew i could not take him up behind the buggy so i had to take emma drive myself ma sister maria went to town this evening mrs rosenfield was here a while this evening glad to see her like her very much she told us this place was going to be attacked as a kind of a blind then proceed to nashville which they hoped to take hope it is true for i am sick of the yankees they have been receiving reinforcements ever since the first alarm are fortifying out near town with fence rails bettie i think of fasting for the success of our arms here kate told us what word charley sent us c heard the town was going to be burnt tonight don't believe a word of it several yankees have been to see the old frenchman but they have not moved him yet that rascally fellow that claims to be a pittsburgh lawyer was here after supper to see him a little while tuesday june 10th 1862 bettie and i fasted thinking our troops might attack this place but the day has passed no trouble so far i guess there must be at least 10 or 12 thousand yankees here by this time i understood they said they intended having 15,000 by this evening it is believed they went in search of our poor boys tonight i think we should send up our prayers for their protection tonight cousin tabitha morgan her two children aunt beck snell spent the day with us they have not found where beauregard is yet there is a great many surmises about his whereabouts but echo answers echo cousin ann walked up to see mrs staley this evening a little while wednesday june 11th 1862 no news in the paper bettie i ran over a few minutes to see mrs maney to hear the news she said a letter had been received in nashville saying we had gained three grand victories in va for us not to believe anything that yankees had to say for it was impossible for us to hear any good news from our army through them aunt nancy avent was here when we returned we walked up as far as mrs pritchett's with her aunt nancy asked mrs pritchett if it was true about her son taking letters from here to our boys to come home take the oath she said she did not know what the letters contained but old ashburn dr wheeler employed him to go promised him 25 now would now pay him because he failed to bring a reply tom pritchett was in danger of his life while away for our men were about hanging him as a spy after we came back bettie was taken quite ill had to send for dr bob wendle i think she was considerably frightened thursday 12th 1862 bettie is a good deal better today no news mrs joe ewing called out to see cousin ann this evening we walked down to see mrs johnson a few minutes this evening friday 13th 1862 ma cousin ann went up town this evening soon ephe drove back saying two gentlemen were coming out to supper spend the night but said he did not know who they were but ma said we must treat them very politely we puzzled our brain to know who they were but all for no purpose for we could not guess at last we saw them coming we dressed intending if they were union people for we could see they were not yankees by their dress for they had on citizen clothes or as the boys say store clothes we intended to give them a piece of our minds before pa ma returned to lecture us about it we went down just gave it to the union men yankees about here when after talking sometime they told us they were confederates escaped from camp butler ill told us all about they trouble they had c c they said they were most afraid to come out here didn't know whether they would be welcome or not we said southern soldiers were always welcome made every exertion to render ourselves agreeable i played sang for them they were from tenn one from readyville the other from near woodberry one was a mr wood the other a mr sullivan i went to school with mr wood's sister i pretended to be angry so that the servants might believe they were union i don't like to act deceitfully but occasions require it in war times fanny maney spent the night with rosa william was out fishing today brought home some very nice fish he seemed to be very inquisitive about who our guests were but ma wouldn't tell him ma bought me quite a pretty solid pink muslin saturday 14th 1862 bettie i went up to the store then around to the shoe store to see about her shoes but they were not finished then stopped on our way back to see kate marchbanks but remained but a short time as bettie cousin ann were going out to mr joe ewing's while we were in the store a yankee came in and was telling about running back from east tenn for fear our men were trying to out flank them they are great cowards when there is anything like equal numbers they got back last night col parkhurst was not taken prisoner as we had learned but gotten back safe much to our regret but i suppose to miss joe reeves joy our guest ephraim pretended to take fishing today they left them out in the country to make their escape farther they were friends of mr tally's but he promised not to tell on them he tried to get them to take the oath but they would not do it bettie i told them what we thought of mr tally fanny maney went home before dinner the children all went down to aunt sophia lytles to a party this evening came back perfectly delighted we heard that bro john had been taken prisoner up at shelbyville he dispatched to pa so he ma went up this afternoon don't know when they will return pa could only get a pass for himself she went any way the reason they wouldn't let ma have one they knew she would say for him never to take the oath to die first i'm glad ma left her pistol here as i shall try use it if i find it necessary sunday 15th 1862 this morning mrs wilson mother of dr wilson came in expecting to see ma was quite disappointed that she did not she spent the day returned this evening to her brother's sister amanda hearing that bro jno was going to pass on the train came in in company with mrs klirk mrs w myself also went over to the depot but bro did not pass the train being so late i persuaded sister a mrs k to take dinner with us mr duffer went over to the train with them while we were in mr stevenson's parlor he came in dressed as fine as any dandy did not look at all like a widower of few weeks standing he is in for marrying to judge from his looks i must say was not at all favorably impressed it might have been the conversation he struck up about taking the oath i said very little but my remarks were pointed he had too much yankee about him for me when i began to denounce old capt rounds mr duffer said i must not say a word against him as he had taken several out riding yesterday he among the number i told him i would consider it a great disgrace to be seen with him i can't bear to see men so willing to knuckle to such law down scoundrels after being insulted trampled upon as they have been it seems that the last drop of courage with the men of rutherford co has died out or else left for parts unknown or take up its abode in women kind sallie lytle kate mattie avent came out spent the evening rosa returned spent the night capt frost was out this evening brought the paper no news only their defeat at richmond the yankees how thankful we should be for that victory mrs wilson thinks if dr black mr l black were arrested they would take the oath before leaving their families if i was a wife i would say go die before taking that vile oath sister amanda was telling me about mary spence telling mary turner to persuade her pa to take the oath so that she could ride around have fun like she did i guess she wants everybody to put themselves on equality with herself she was bragging about having a yankee officer been showed a handsome diamond ring she said he gave her poor goose i wish i had never been intimate with her but i will never be so again pa ma came just as we finished supper pa quite tired ma not at all well said bro john was looking quite badly that mr cooper a union man said he would be paroled in a few days i hope nothing will induce him to take the oath i think it is strange that will mcfadden's mother uncle sister insist on his taking the oath when it is contrary to his conscience i should feel quite guilty were i to do such a thing bro john said he never saw such running in his life as they did the yankees as they came from east tenn he said they nearly run him to death they killed a doz horses there one night but it made little difference as they took any they saw belonging to other people pa brought sad news to sister maria the death of her brother walter the wound on his hand healed nearly up when he went out took a good deal of exercise which threw him into a fever which caused his death poor fellow i'm sorry he died away from home but no doubt he had kind friends to attend him monday 16th 1862 brother will sister maria children went to her mothers this morning cousin ann was in spent the morning ma has been sick all day kate avent sallie lytle are spending the night with rosa billie buck duffer with ephe the yankees brought in a dozen of our men prisoners i heard they were citizens they had picked up they had 80 at shelbyville out of that six were soldiers ma said they had old grey headed men she judged they must be sixty years old i hope we will be revenged yet i understand old bill spence has started for washington city on some more of his villainy i hope our boys will catch hang him he is a vile rascal tuesday june 17th 1862 aunt nancy avent was out here a little while this morning she told ma of an opportunity of writing to sister mary legrand so i wrote to sister mary though didn't write so any stranger could tell anything about it where i lived or anything else so if it chanced to fell into the yankees they wouldn't be much wise i think it doubtful if she herself understands every thing in it pa is going to write to legrand we heard he had not reenlisted spoke of coming home next month pa is going to write him word if he comes he will have to take the oath i hope he has joined the army again for i want my brothers to aid in sending the yankees to their long home mrs tom johnson was out here a little while this morning came to inquire about mr johnson mrs rosenfield was up to see ma also bro john did not get home but sent word not to be uneasy that he would be down soon if he should take the oath i could trust no one i know he won't i have more confidence in him than to believe such a thing of him ma was up town this evening while she was gone mrs james drove by got a book belonging to her son fred that bro john had sent down i did not see her heard that she was very much opposed to fred's coming home going to send word for him not to come mrs wm anderson kate marchbanks walked out here late this evening their visit did me a great deal of good as i had quite a headache a little blues ma returned while they were here brought a rumor that our man starns had captured a lot of their men wagons hope it will be confirmed the 9th michigan have moved their camps over quite near us in maj maney's lot much to our regret they can lay their hands on many things which they will not fail to do keep garden or nothing else will be saved when will this unholy war come to an end not until our country is ruined i fear wednesday june 18th 1862 sister maria bro will tommy drove by here enroute for their place no one but william got out as they said they didn't have time bro jno failed to come today though we sent over to the depot pa wrote to legrand sent him some money i've been quite busy sewing this evening a yank came to buy milk while waiting for it began to speak in disrespectful terms of our southern boys i got up walked out blazed out at him there is no telling what rascality he will attempt i will never speak to him but i got so vexed with him i couldn't help speaking my mind i heard they brought down judge marchbanks as a prisoner this evening i was so sorry was in hopes he would escape them i must go up and see kate soon i wish the good news about her brother charley those other boys escaping may be true it was so reported yesterday that every preacher teacher merchant doctor or any other person whatever engaged in any business whatever should be compelled to take the oath before going on it i'm glad it is not to be put in effect yet for old capt rounds told pa today that it would not be served yet i hope ere they have a chance our men will be back yesterday they arrested all the ministers it has come to a terrible pass it gets worse every day mr baldwin says they 20th of this month will be a terrible bloody battle that the whole earth will be strewn with dead bodies of the yankees so that it will have to take 6 months to bury them i think the southern people ought to fast pray that the lord might be on our side thursday june 19th 1862 had a nice rain yesterday which has made it quite damp cool today brother john failed to come i haven't felt very well today ma went up to see mrs winship but she was too low to see any one the notice that every one should take the oath has been served only those that are under bond are exempt from it so i guess tomorrow will be more like sunday than ever oh me when will we be relieved from this tyranny the yanks were very much frightened today they learned our army was in large force near here they sent out in different directions to see if they could find any of our men but so far they have not good many yanks have gone to nashville so i understand many think they are retreating it is reported that old gen mitchell is at shelbyville i hope his entire force including himself will be captive ere he arrives here they first spoke of occupying our lot but through the influence of some gentleman changed mrs eaton closes her school tomorrow as yankee officers take it for headquarters friday 20th 1862 today is the one that dr baldwin said would be the great battle i wish i knew whether it had come off or not no news up town a good deal of stir among the yankees one regt left this morning i hear that another leaves this evening or tomorrow went up to see kate marchbanks aunt n avent mrs jas avent was there going to spend the night stopped at the boles to speak to them as i came home met mrs robt wendle addie ledbetter laura ledbetter stopped had a little chat as we stood talking mrs reeve's carriage passed by but we turned away did not speak on returning home found it had been out here with the two mrs reeves in it to get ma to go see old mrs rounds i see through the old woman's actions she can't fool me then to be enquiring so particularly after me as if she cared a row of pins whether i was dead or living if her girls don't get visitors until i call on them they will wait a long time i saw corean reeves who is in deep mourning for confederate officer out at the gate talking to a yankee officer it is a wonder that the ghost of lieut bagley don't haunt her if he could no doubt would i learned that laura carter of nashville was married to a yankee she came very near marrying a confederate officer not long ago brother john did not come home judge marchbanks was sent down to nashville also mr robert smith although he has taken the oath just because two men staid all night at his house while he his wife were absent from home mr richhammer was also arrested today don't know for what pa has his doors closed on account of that order i heard thirty doors were closed and only seven open i'm glad to hear the majority is on our side kate m said she heard that the yanks said they were going to confiscate all pianoes that the girls practiced southern music on i expect the next thing families will not be permitted to visit a yankee asked a citizen if he thought a picnic would be an easy matter to be gotten up yes said the man when our army returns pretty good they have been enquiring where the best springs were said if they gave one they would have their bands out to play on the occasion have a splendid time i know well enough i shouldn't attend saturday 21st 1862 i suppose we had just as well quit looking for bro jno leave off sending over to the depot for him for he has disappointed us again there is no use trusting union men no matter how plausible they are william carney tommie tommie butler stopped on their way to mr butler's to hear the news mrs dr bedford paid us quite a sociable visit this morning dr robt wendle lady were out to see us this morning i like them so much cousin ann bettie came in this afternoon from mr ewing's a yankee had to ride in the carriage with them before they permitted them to pass the pickets ma cousin ann went up to see mrs winship found her so low that cousin ann remained with her heard that old bill spence wife had gone on to washington city i suppose it was to him we are indebted for the last two notices not even a dr can go and see a sick person without taking the oath or getting permission bill spence said he was going to have the reins drawn tighter in our town i hope he will soon reap his reward i understand mr mrs hord are union too are down on our family i've got no use for any such sunday 22nd 1862 there was no news today no service except at the baptist church mr pendleton is a union man i heard that 8 of his members withdrew from his church on account of praying for the yanks i think all southern people should withdraw monday june 23rd 1862 rosa bettie cousin ann went up town this morning the two first came home before dinner but cousin a remained until late in the evening they all brought good news for us said that gen buel was retreating that we had a large army at shelbyville that morgan was in 75 miles of here old dr wheeler has gone up north because he thinks our boys will soon be back he will get paid off for his meanness sister maria was in town i understand getting her mourning clothes for herself mother kate avent is spending the night here rosa was up there this evening all seem in fine spirits tuesday june 24th 1862 this morning heard that richmond has been taken though it is not generally believed pa sent word back to cousin ann that will wilkinson would call out get a bundle she wanted to send out to mr ewing's bettie i fearing he might call for us left home as i don't want to see people who have taken the oath we went up to see mollie crockett met old mr crockett there whom i had not seen for months she mollie said her husband mr robt crockett tom tucker sent their love to me i hope it is true about the exchange of prisoners poor fellows they have had a hard time of it it was rumored they were to pass here today but it proved a mistake mollie told me that aunt judy said she thought bill spence was blamed too much in town she did not think him such a bad person as everybody thought him i would not be surprised the next thing i heard that uncle ephe had come home that cousin mary mary spence were very intimate i think policy can be carried entirely too far we drove by mrs winship's to see how she was by aunt nancy's to hear the news no news but very cheerful we stopped by a few moments to hear how mrs wm anderson's little child was that has been quite sick for several days mr wilkinson had not been out neither did he come this evening which i was glad of heard that holly springs miss had been taken i should like to know where dr wilson sister mary are they were to spend the summer here provided they could get up here i wish she was here though i wouldn't have him take the oath for anything poor brother john hasn't been permitted yet to come it is reported that a large battle will be fought near shelbyville soon a regt from here went up to the assistance of the yankees today although old gen mitchell buel are both there kate avent is still with rosa buck alexander has taken the oath come home i'm glad i'm not acquainted with him hope i never will be who can we trust a yankee capt died at mrs maney's yesterday i

anxious to hear something from brother john speaks of going up to see him soon if she uncle tommy can get a pass which we heard they could do she told me a great secret that uncle ephe is at home not a servant knows it i'm almost afraid to write it down i hope he will leave before he is found out only three of his oldest children know it mary was very prudent when in town the other day not to have mentioned it from several hints i believe uncle john is near home too rosa went out to see josey turner with sister amanda bettie went up to get aunt mcculloch burial clothes as a note was written in asking cousin ann to get them though she is not quite dead but very ill mrs duffer's little baby died this morning bettie i are going to sit up with the corpse tonight the yankees have been whipped at

companies were ordered to leave here this morning glad tidings were brought us we have whipped the yankees near memphis richmond taken a train of wagons which i'm rejoiced to hear when pa wrote the news out he also mentioned that a young gentleman the name of ridell that was in prison with him would come out home with him of course we were all curiosity in a few moments it was announced he was coming after they had been here some time bettie i went down found him quite a nice young man rather dasky than otherwise we went down after they had been here awhile found him quite a nice man very prudent noncomittal on all subjects in regard to himself rather a don't care air about him that i like he is staying all night pa has invited him to make our house his home while he remains in murfreesboro sister maria enroute for her own home drove by here in the morning but not having time to get out didn't stop until her return in the afternoon ephe spent the day with them mrs acking of shelbyville stopped by to see if we had any message to send bro john we all joined in saying not to take the oath
tuesday july 1st 1862 raining all day mr riddell still here he is quite a mystery i think we understand him better than he imagines cousin ann ma went out to see aunt sallie in the morning in the afternoon went to uncle tom turner's they have a pass for four or five days they are trying to make good use of it helen remained out at aunt sarah's tonight good news of yesterday confirmed mr riddell went up town about 15 minutes brought us a large lot of candy back we were not downstairs so he and pa had to entertain themselves the best they could taking a toddy c wednesday july 2nd 1862 a lovely day mr riddell got to the depot just as the train was leaving rather too late didn't seem to care about being left came back here bettie i were getting ready to go out calling with him when on looking out who should be seen driving up but william wilkinson much to our astonishment for we have said so much about people taking the oath he must surely have heard i told him about taking the oath and i expect he got offended but i don't care he said he had heard from his brother george last week that he had received directed to his care a letter from mr sikes i wish i could have seen it mr wilkinson did not stay long as we went in with our bonnets on made our excuse we took mr riddell up to see addie ledbetter eliza nelson lucy leiper kate marchbanks i think he liked kate best though he is rather indifferent some times he seems to like talking to bettie then again to desire my company i seat myself at the piano play away without seeming to notice him he in his turn seems perfectly indifferent when all of a sudden he would make some remark on what i have been playing which would lead me to conclude he had been listening the whole time he is not a flatterer like most men but quiet easy manners kate avent is staying with rosa tonight ma cousin ann are getting ready to go to shelbyville in the morning thursday july 3rd 1862 i forgot to mention that aunt mcculloch dies yesterday was buried this evening i understand she even did not have a minister to sing or pray they could not get a permit to have a funeral preached ma cousin ann started to shelbyville this morning they were to meet sister amanda on the road all go together they started before we were up mr riddell left on the train today we miss him very much this morning to my surprise he hoisted the piano asked me to play seemed to take quite an interest in my playing i can't help but think his indifference about every thing is assumed pa accompanied him over to the depot which proved a fortunate thing as bro jno the rest of the confederate prisoners were carried down to nashville today i am so sorry that ma sister a will be so disappointed in getting to s too late to see him kate avent went home early this morning a yankee rode up here i sent prisy out to see what he wanted he said dr fritz wanted some wine if ma would please send him some he is the old sick frenchman that bettie i used to say guarded the house with his canteen we didn't have any wine but i permitted against my will prisy to put some cordial into his bottle pa saw as he thought two yankees coming he quietly walked out the back way but they proved citizens but the servant did not ask them in heard that maj childress gave dining had old capt rounds others of that stamp to it it is very strange i regret to see persons come under so much i'm almost afraid to write that we heard that mr riddell was a yankee spy though we don't believe it not even pa i don't think it possible he seems such a good southerner i will not believe it until i have proof friday july 4th 1862 ma cousin ann got back soon this morning after spending the night at uncle tommy's they got ready went down to nashville determined to see bro john he sent us word that we talked too much mrs anderson mrs marchbanks went down to see judge marchbanks and much to my astonishment heard that miss bettie childress was escorted on the cars by the yankee capt rounds she her father are bound for sandusky where john childress is a prisoner old rounds must have given them a pass he was enquiring if mrs anderson had a pass i suppose thought ma had not he would have the pleasure of having her taken off the train now wasn't he disappointed won't he grind his teeth in rage joe reeves says she can't see why will wilkinson should cut his horse just opposite her house refuse to speak as it is no worse to take yankee boarders than to take an oath against his brother in the southern army either is certainly bad enough hope i will never be guilty of either mr jno kirk took dinner with us today helen jennie are spending the night at uncle avent's saturday july 5th 1862 the children returned this morning accompanied by jamie mattie avent lela morgan mattie remained until after dinner lela is spending the night bettie hayes took dinner with rosa is quite a pretty girl bettie gillespie went with ephe up town in the buggy kate marchbanks stopped her was telling her how much she admired mr riddell thought him so handsome c pa has been quite sick today mr pritchet was up here a short time today corene reeves joe reeves were at the negro ball last night with capt rounds a married yankee and col parkhurst quite a come off for our city sunday july 6th 1862 ma cousin ann astonished us by returning safely home this morning had not heard a single word from mr riddell they saw brother john he is determined never to take the oath i wish william had had one half the determination lela morgan returned home this morning jennie helen accompanied her but returned before night rosa is spending the night with kate avent mrs john spence sent me word they had a prayer meeting this afternoon but ma went up town this afternoon so i did not attend they arrested mr eagleton's two sons this afternoon am sorry but they should have gone back to the army ere this monday july 7th 1862 it has been quite warm all day bettie helen jennie were up town this morning rosa returned home from uncle avent's this morning sister maria and william came by and stopped awhile this afternoon the eagleton brothers took the oath shame upon them exciting news the pickets on the lebanon liberty manchester pikes were fired upon i understand a number were killed a large number of yankees went out just come in now ten o'clock bringing about 60 persons i can't see how we can live through so much suffering i wish if the southern army was coming it would hasten on tuesday july 8th 1862 this morning ma sister amanda went down to see bro jno carrying his provisions clothes jose turner came in william's barouche and is staying with rosa mr watterson a confederate prisoner who had taken the oath came up on the cars said he thought bro jno would be paroled come up tomorrow he ate dinner with us seems very polite quite intelligent if he hadn't taken the oath i would think him quite nice i must confess to be crowded into the filthy jail filled with vermine with little air scarcely food to sustain life then threatened if they did not take it they would be forced in their cells or else lose their life it is awful to think of those low born yankees andy johnson at the head of them acting towards our men so cruelly the yankees did not succeed in taking a single one of our men prisoners last night but bringing 19 citizens old young making no exceptions when the ladies sent the poor men their dinners the yankees ate it up sent word it was very nice that they enjoyed it i hope it will make the last one of them sick mr joe ewing is among the number of prisoners our little army outside of town numbers 75 but the yankees did not get to see them prisy seems intensely gratified whenever she hears any bad news for our army quite angry when we rejoice over bad news over the yankees i understand the union men are getting considerably frightened wednesday july 9th 1862 ma sister amanda came up from nashville some man not knowing sister a was married fell very much in love with her i expect if bro john had been on the train he would have kicked the fellow off poor bro john failed to get paroled couldn't have a trial on account some say of andy johnson being sick others drunk more likely this last the widow corcan the name miss g reeves is known by was on the train carrying on extensively with rounds much to the disgust of all modest refined people william carney took sister amanda josie turner out home this afternoon mrs kate heard came out all dressed up on horse back looking very spry quite a warm ride but suppose a young widow would say never mind the weather so the wind don't blow she came to enquire of ma about a cousin of hers that was a prisoner as soon as she left ma cousin ann went up town while away mrs adnerson kate came out staid until ma returned they wanted to hear from their father it is rumored all the yankees except the cavalry are to leave here hope our men will bag them before they get very far ma was advised not to visit much after friday it is thought morgan's men are near here much to my astonishment ma spoke in high terms of mr riddell mrs anderson said her father judge marchbanks thought him quite a nice young man i am glad every body thinks that as i have been out calling with him on the girls charley marchbanks wrote back word for kate to tell me that he thought jessie sikes really believed me in love with him fiddle sticks if he was not a southern prisoner i might say how presumptuous but i will only keep a powerful thinking july 11th 1862 i've been sewing this morning had not company come in unexpectedly would have finished easily tomorrow but just after we had eaten dinner two ladies whom pa met while in prison came here while i carried them up to take off their bonnets had to have something prepared for them to eat it was a mrs hobson a miss turley from nashville they expected to have come up to have seen their cousin return on the next train but they failed in getting off soon enough so they just came out here the young man is a mr richardson of ala was in camp chase made his escape got this far south was captured going to be tried as a guerrilla ma accompanied the ladies back to prison taking clothes provisions with her mr paul simp harris are also in the cell with mr richardson of course they got some of the nice things while they were away bettie i walked down to see mary lockie duffer found their little brother very ill offered to come tomorrow night to sight up told my reason for not being with them tonight that must be quite an unhealthy place there seems to be someone continually sick there it is a good thing i did not stay as i was quite sick through the night they brought in more citizens many hope they will be the means of having other citizens released as they can prove it was starns men starns sent them word to come out and meet him he was ready for any of them saturday july 12th 1862 this morning ma the ladies went up to see the prisoners after their return they ate a snack pa bettie i took them in our carriage over to the depot we had to wait until about 3 o'clock before the cars came down they had run off above here he misses reeves were escorted by 13 yankee soldiers for protection from our men the very idea 50 or 60 yanks went down the pike to hunt for our men i hope our men will capture them i haven't been well all day july 13th 1862 how to begin i know not i was aroused early this morning by firing it has surely been an eventful day i knew the firing must come from our own brave boys sprang from my bed rushed to the window called to cousin ann bettie we dressed hurriedly not knowing what moment our house yard would be full to overflowing with either our men or the frightened yankees the blue coats began to make a bee line through our yard front yard asking pa to protect them but he told them to push on acting on his advice they kept moving it was amusing to see how frightened they were although it was such a serious time i prayed for victory while i hissed the frightened yankees on expecting every minute to received a parting shot from some of them just think only the day before they were our masters i thought what would be our fate if our poor fellows were whipped the engagement grew general in a few moments persons dared not venture out on the square if they did a report a vacant saddle would be seen as the horse would dash by carry their fate to their comrades our boys after forming behind some one story buildings made a bold rush gaining the court house but many fell ere they reached the door and although the yankees had every advantage they were forced to surrender our prisoners turned out to seek their families friends two of them stopped on their way home out here mr peyton mr brothers they looked so happy but who did not except the dusky forms that hovered around our front steps the gentlemen were afraid to venture up town as they were firing from the houses so much it was dangerous to go on the street in the meanwhile they had attacked the camp down by the river where the battery was stationed on the approach of our men threw themselves into a hollow square with their artillery pointed to resist a determined attack and as our men had nothing but shot guns they could not get in range were compelled to fall back three times but later in the day a flag of truce was sent in a few minutes they consulted surrendered 15,000 men including sick wounded including cannons camp equipage which was mostly burnt small arms this is one of the greatest victories of the war considering the number engaged gen forrest reports 17,000 men consisting of his men texas rangers a number were georgians with a single piece of artillery besides being the attacking party i'm sure the hand of providence guided directed our boys for without a higher power that handful of men could never have succeeded against such odds our great father saw our suffering travails gen duffield was wounded early in the engagement taken to maj maney's gen crittenden surrendered to mrs hagen the lady with whom he was boarding he was the man that came up to have several of our men hung tomorrow some say that was why the attack was hurried yes old gen crittenden said we had not a right to the air we breathed just yesterday i would like to have asked him who had a right now two genl's four col's ever so many lt's capt's and others were captured a glorious haul gen duffield was paroled with a number of others that could not be taken away on account of their wounds when col lester went up on the square he asked where is the army that took us gen forrest proudly answered here they are pointing to our handful of dirty worn down by travel boys that stood by a nobler set never breathed than those rough looking fellows nobler hearts never beat the poor fellows that were waiting for the yankees decision about surrendering went fast to sleep so fatigued were they by forced marches no rest the yankee col awoke our officer by saying we surrender we surrender that gave the yankees some idea how independent our boys were we saw a texas ranger ride hastily over to mrs laws ma thinking he needed something made us run over and ask if we could do anything for him or any of the rest of his comrades he was introduced as mr dodd of ky though now a ranger thanked us but said he had been provided for by the kind ladies up town found him quite nice saw a mr mcka come riding up kissing his hand we all rushed out to shake his hand pa asked if he had ever met him before but he said no but i'm a confederate soldier very proudly he replied we insisted so he had to get down come in get breakfast but would take nothing to drink which made me think all the more of him said he never drank anything while he was breakfasting we trimmed his hat off beautifully with flowers not knowing then until sometime afterwards that he was a single man he had heard that two stray horses were here thought one of them might be his but neither were but sent us word by cousin william tilford this afternoon that he found his many thanks for our kindness that morning as our soldiers were starting to attack the camp by maj maney's we saw two of our men coming toward our house we insisted on them getting down having something to eat they said as they were about to charge the enemy they didn't have time but finally said they would take a strong cup of coffee while they were drinking it the yanks surrendered without any trouble we had gone up into the garret to see the fight but everything was very quiet in the evening those two rangers returned ate supper with us lieut fort ajg robinson when they got here not a servant was on the place and we had to take their places until their return the yankee provost marshall was found hid between two feather beds in miss corean's bed the cover spread up pillows upon it it was at mrs reeves that he was captured mrs reeves the girl treated our men shamefully said they didn't permit such ragged men to come to their house our men permitted col parkhurst to go by and tell josephine goodbye our men did better than the yankees for they never allowed our boys to say goodbye to either mother or sister much less sweetheart they pressed mrs reeves carriage into service to take one of the wounded soldiers off when it was returned they cut up considerable said they would never again ride in it as if the yankees had not time again took our carriage horses everything else they could lay their hands on monday july 14th 1862 we can scarcely realize the joy of being free many expect the yankees back today bettie i sat up at mrs duffer's last night cam back slept until nine in the meantime having been waked up several times which we did not relish one bit uncle john lytle was in to see us it has been a long long time since i had seen him aunt helen her two daughters bettie mollie mrs king were in to see us but had to leave early for fear the yanks would put out pickets sister amanda mary turner were here also had to hurry off ma pa have been away from home all day attending to wounded soldiers principally yankee ones we had our rooms prepared for some of the wounded confederates but did not succeed in getting any to nurse mrs john burton was here a few moments this morning a number of ladies went out to the battlefield i should like to have seen it i slept nearly all the afternoon then got up had our new horse attended to the one the rangers left with us tuesday july 15th 1862 it was clear until the middle of the day then the clouds gathered rained very hard cousin ann bettie i were up town today b i stopped to see kate marchbanks everybody seems so so happy we that are southern in feelings sympathize in our troubles share our joys kate will leave us for the mountains tomorrow if nothing prevents her doing so she insisted we should remain tell mrs anderson goodbye but she did not get back before we left we stopped at mrs boles they were as happy as we were had as much to tell us as kate had they said they heard a gentleman say he knew the negro that cursed us he would have him shot we then went around to uncle avent's on our way mrs brady hailed us would have a talk with us cousins tabitha ell were both around at their mother's had a bundle of news to tell capt rounds shot one of our men from the window at mrs reeves he ran into aunt's told them who shot him they told us how the reeves girls did i left bettie there to return with her mother i came back alone i saw anna murfree just as i passed mrs henderson's we had quite a long talk she said 4 yankees had died up at soule college since yesterday and one was about to die said also they seem to be very grateful for the kindness of the ladies but that those at the university were very ungrateful it is rumored that nashville has been taken by our men clarksville has been attacked if the first was true bro john would have been home by this time kate avent is spending the night with rosa last night 3 persons came up the pavement rung the bell we did not know at first who it was pa made them give their names before he let them in for we were afraid they were yankees but they were after clothes to bury one of our men that had died wednesday july 16th 1862 was up writing before breakfast ma pa were around to see our wounded soldiers that are scattered around town we have lost several they say it is impossible for some of the rest to get well ma pa went up to see uncle ephe lytle this afternoon they report aunt judy is looking badly 13 or 14 of our soldiers passed by here today took that yankee storekeeper prisoner that our boys made take the oath it is reported that gen cheatham is in five miles of nashville going to attack it the yanks are fortifying it strongly the 1st regt is with cheatham legrand with it kate avent returned home this morning old mr fritz that old frenchman that staid a day or two out here sent word for ma to send for him but neither pa or ma was here or the buggy either and i was glad of it as i don't want him here thursday july 17th 1862 i aroused earlier than usual found it raining quite hard a paroled yankee took breakfast here this morning he is from bowling green ky has been wanting ma pa to help him desert writing home to his brother not to join the army that they were not fighting for what they thought they were his name was holmes ma pa went up to see our wounded at dinner another paroled yankee came for his dinner and as our boys had burnt up all their provisions i felt it was a charity to give him something to eat as he praised our boys said they even took their own provisions gave to them depriving themselves of something to eat i afterwards found out he was an abolitionist born in boston now living in the west he pretended to blame his officers for surrendering everything he said only made me love dixie the southern boys more than ever he said an unsophisticated country girl was out about 4 miles in the country sitting on a ten rail fence hurrahing for jeff davis said her mouth was large enough but when she opened it it reminded him of a coffee pot with the top open he intended that as a witty remark but i couldn't see the wit or the beauty either i did not enjoy the remark at all if i had thought of it i would have given him another specimen by making an ugly mouth at him old mr fritz came here before dinner i don't know for how long the yankees came in town did not stay long i wonder if they have found afraid in their dictionary yet two flags of truce were in today one from our men saying for the paroled yankees to leave here another from the yankees to see about their sick i must not forget a third that came in to hunt for their wagon some say he came in just to look around some think we will have a big battle here tomorrow but i don't think so or our men would not have sent word they would be in with 30,000 men friday july 18th 1862 i sometimes find myself writing before breakfast no prospect of a fight the day is clear beautiful ma cousin ann went up town this morning most everyone is very much frightened aunt nancy avent cousin tabitha morgan sent a good many of their things out here expecting the town to be burned the yankees came in town just before dinner stopped all traveling even on the streets ma started the servant twice but they didn't succeed in getting pa's dinner to him ephe came out said they were searching everybody's house for brooms guns can't imagine what they want with brooms they are concentrating their troops around the square and as they are very wet having rained quite hard probably they want to exercise to keep from taking cold or may be to keep us from cleaning up our boys any more we saw about 12 or 14 coming i thought they were going to search our house too so placed my little southern flag in my bosom for i had made it hoping to wave it at our dear boys as they would pass by i hid helen's flag also in the same place a box of powder a number of union envelopes that i had as trophies marched up as if the place belonged to them rung the bell with quite an air said they came to get horses wagons ma said they should not have hers that she would see gen nelson about it the officer said very impertinently come on boy's we will go and see what she has got take them bettie i heard them from our window and rushed downstairs into the yard went to where the horses were gave them a piece of my mind rebuked them for running at shiloh richmond bull's run c c he put on quite a bold air first but cooled down considerable before i got through bettie then came forward and gave them another cutting speech some of the privates enjoyed the way we treated the officer one told me to ask him about running at pittsburgh landing i really believe that although they were all in yankee blue some of them were good southern men one said he wished all my brothers might get home safely that he never intended to kill our boys if he could help it they seem to have quite a contempt for that egotistical officer they had with them they finally said if we would lend the cart and one horse they would pledge their word it should be brought back to our surprise it came back in an hour's time all right ma had the buggy gotten up and went after pa as they would not let him come out home they had several citizens arrested everybody advised her not to attempt going up in town but she did saw one of the officers and got pa a permit to return home old bill spence ashburn ned jordan came in with the army the citizens may expect a gay time now as they are grand scoundrels i wish i had known where old ashburn was hid i should have told on him the reeves i understand have been up since 5 o'clock cheering the yankees on they ought to be run out of town after falling as low as they have mrs anderson her sister kate have not yet left town mrs lain was over here a few moments this evening saturday july 19th 1862 the yankees allowed pa to take something to eat to william carney who was put in the guard house yesterday for being drunk a mr baker a union man whom they had arrested for the same cause was out of his head jumped from the 2nd story window killed himself the yanks issued a proclamation that everything that had been taken from the yankee camps must be brought back or they will be imprisoned andrew one of our negro boys got up bright early took back everything he and his mother had picked up after the left from the camps they wanted to give the clothes back but he would not take them one time today it was reported the armies were fighting but it was a mistake several yankees came out wanted to take our horses but pa would not let them two yankees came up and asked for something to eat said it was some time since they had eaten anything had no money either to buy anything pa gave them food mr jobe was out here told ma good news from our army the overseer of uncle john lytle's is spending the night here although he has taken the oath he cannot get a pass to go out home from what we hear they will all have to take the oath again dr baskett has been arrested again suspect bill spence is at the head of it ashburn told mr wilkinson if he did not go out and show our men to him that were in sunday he would have him arrested sunday july 20th 1862 this morning the first thing i heard was many voices at once in finding out who they were learned it was 9 yankees that had come ordered their breakfast only 7 seven remained the other two thought it would be too long preparing said if we didn't give them something to eat they would take every horse on the place pa was the only member of the family that went in where they were they ate everything up and the cook had to get a fresh supply most of the left without even thanking pa for his kindness scarcely had they gone when two more scamps said they had orders to take every horse they saw pa ma went out and talked quite plain to them said they should not have them until a written order was shown one of them told ma if she were a man he would whip her but they did not get the horses quite a number were here before dinner 5 more took that meal here 4 more came 2 remaining at the ice house the other two came to the house one little fellow had the bridle was going to take him whether or not when pa pretended he had a guard here he left in a hurry made the remark on leaving they would have them yet even were they to have to get armed men to come with them so ma started up town after a guard as the provost marshall said in the morning she might have one but when she went said so many had applied for guards he could not furnish one but if she would apply to the col of cavalry she could get one ma thinking gen nelson might give her one sent in her name stated her business an officer was treating her very politely just starting over after a guard when old ashburn slipped into the gen s room and i suppose he must have told the gen something for he had him immediately recalled sent ma a very insulting message for she pa to go home stay there not to show their faces any more if they didn't want to be eaten out of house and home ma said she didn't care about their eating for she had been feeding them all day we didn't know what to do but in a few moments a yankee came out enquired very particularly into the case sent lt h h fisk to guard us accompanied by himself said they would stay tonight didn't know whether or not they would stay longer bettie i neither went into supper i dislike very much to eat at the table with the yankees monday july 21st 1862 this morning bettie i neither went to the table where they were but while we sat eating two yankees came twice after our horses twice the guards went out after them came near shooting them thereby preventing them taking either pa's or our horses then bettie i spoke to them one is named charley leisure the other lt h.r fisk so far they seem to be very polite spunky kind of fellows mrs lain came over a few moments this morning brother john came bettie i were upstairs sewing but we rushed frantically down giving him a big kiss before them mrs burton two children came to hear from mr john burton who is in prison in nashville a lt vail called on ma to see about his men disturbing us but thinks really it was just to get acquainted with the family he was dressed up quite handsomely but none of us made our appearance he made his stay until after dinner said he was ordered off on a scouting expedition at two o'clock bro john left before bettie i finished our dinner so didn't have an opportunity of asking his opinion about pa's friend mr riddell this evening bettie i went up town to see kate marchbanks she and mrs anderson both seemed glad to see us had many things to tell us especially about the yankees the day they got our horse cart they got their horse that mr anderson had only purchased a day or two before turned it loose they had not since found him it is a wonder they returned ours so soon in a fine condition as they found him if we had not blazed away so terrible at them i don't think they would have mrs anderson is unfortunate about losing horses kate took us down to see a wounded confederate at mrs hicks he is from ga his name is smith the room was filled with ladies i wish he could be brought out here that house is so warm cramped up while they were all engaged in conversation mary matilda or maud florence as she terms herself came over and began a conversation as if by chance i asked her about her sweetheart whom she is engaged a morgan man i asked his given name his place of residence i haven't the least doubt that our friend mr riddell's brother charley mary matilda's beaux are one the same fellow i hope persons won't find it out will forget we went calling with him entertained him in our house gordon reeves received a letter from capt rounds by the paroled soldiers a married man too a texan took him up behind him until he got out of town then put him on a little mule but on his way out stopped and told mr beard how he was captured between two feather beds it must have been very mortifying to get to hear such a reflection on his bravery he made many beautiful promises if they would only parole him he would go home stay there gen nelson said if capt rounds had not been so taken up with his wives murfreesboro never would have been taken he says if he hears of one of his men going to see a woman in this town he will have them shot i suppose he means to get in one of his tantrums he drove all mrs hagan's boarders off when she threatened to leave also ordered her to get some mush and milk quick for his dinner or else she would see him in one of his tantrums he is the old chap that threatened to cut a girls throat if she did not let him call upon her mrs hagan replied she could furnish mush but milk she could not she had none in the house no one to send after any suppose he pressed some poor cow into service like he did chickens turkeys which is vile for a private but how much worse for a genl although a large body i fear it is inhabited by a very small soul when mrs james went for a pass to go home look after some of her horses that had been stolen representing her case said she was a widow he said go get married then said you had better marry me a grand old scamp kate walked a short distance while we stopped to talk a short spell with mrs anderson a yankee officer rode up pretending to fix his boot but evidently trying to hear what we had to say we passed on he came very near riding over us we came down to mrs crichlow's house had to knock some time ere we were admitted as she was on the other side of the house talking to two yanks they said they had marching orders for 5 o'clock in the morning several regts have passed through today it is the impression that the yanks are retreating from the south our army is supposed enrout for ky it is buell's army that is passing through some say nelson just came to protect the retreating army i don't think from appearance they are going to tarry long i don't trust the negroes now they have too much of the yankees about them to suit me john morgan is up in indiana has captured a little town there he has cut off communication between louisville ky and nashville when forrest was here the yankee troops were cut off at wartrace from those in nashville had to live on half food they said they were glad enough to get back to get something to eat i hope our boys will capture them all yet when we got home found they had eaten supper earlier than usual as our guards had orders to leave which we regret on account of the protection they afforded us bettie i haven't eaten with them yet but thought as they were so kind to us we would but had not they were from penn one was from philadelphia knew the place i attended school mr rutledge got a pass went home brother will was released today was out here when we returned while they were expecting a battle one of the men that was taken prisoner made his escape he had been so badly frightened by the yankees he mind was effected i hope he will recover we heard after ma was treated so badly by old nelson sunday he heard how kind ma had been to his wounded men he cursed old ashburn to everything good bad ordered her a guard sue brady ell childress were out to see us also lookie duffer while we were away ell sue were telling about how old nelson did them he said quite rough he told mrs tom johnson he would give her a pass once and for all but she must pack up leave this country that he heard what a sesesh she was tuesday july 22nd 1862 this morning early our guards came over a few moments to tell pa goodbye while they were here a yankee came said he was going to have a horse whether or not but the guards prevented him taking it after he left they gave pa a protection for his property then bid him goodbye soon the cavalry were marching away from murfreesboro i hope soon to see the place cleared of the last one of them i can see the spirits of the servants are ebbing low since the yankees are pushing along while they keep moving from this direction william took dinner here but i did not see him cousin ann spent the day up town a flag of truce from our men came this afternoon some say the purported purpose is to exchange prisoners others say it was for the yankees to surrender our messenger had not been replied to yet as i understand mr john kirk uncle tommy came in to see about an order that was sent out to send in hands to fortify the town now their negroes are in mississippi so they could not comply after promising to give them passes to return refused to do so they are both staying with us tonight it seems strange some men they call upon others they do not i have my suspicions about those they don't call upon old genl nelson left bag baggage this morning many think it is a trap to catch forrest i hope they will not be successful if that's their object i understand they have canons planted all around the square old mr fritz was quite sick sent for a dr but couldn't get a single one about 2 o'clock in the night we heard troops going out of town at first we thought it best to dress but changed our minds and slept soundly until day wednesday july 23rd 1862 nearly all yankees have left town this morning mr lillard called by told uncle tommy to hurry go home as they had pickets out on only a few roads so just as soon as they had breakfasted uncle tommy mr kirk brother will left for home cousin ann rosa were up town on coming home brought good news that forrest had captured genl nelson command that he had torn up the railroad from smyrna to nashville burning the depot there that he had dashed through nashville killing many yankees was now hastily crossing the river it is believed that genl beaureguarde is in ky i was astonished to hear of aunt nancy avent defending maj maney for protecting old ashburn for he is as mean as old bill spence that rascal was nearly frightened out of his wits yesterday when the flag of truce came in is now selling off at cost preparing to leave here i hope our boys will have a chance at him yet this evening bettie i put our sewing by walked over to mrs lain's while there saw yankees returning into town which we were sorry to see proved to be old nelson his command not less than 10,000 came in we watched them until too dark to see them then we could hear them coming still coming they were very much jaded evidently worn out could scarcely drag one foot before the other the ebony images were overjoyed to see them return while at supper one yankee came to buy bread but pa said he had none to sell but asked him into supper i finished mine in a hurry left the table he thanked pa when he was through said they were in 4 miles of nashville our men had destroyed the bridge captured a number of their men but they came upon the rear of our army retaking their men and two of ours said we killed 10 of their men in the fight the yankee said our army did not have the cross roads down below here until 2 o'clock today one of our old guards returned and came out tonight was quite glad as the yankees are tired hungry they may take it into their heads to do any mischief tonight being so disappointed old nelson i suppose is in one of his tantrums will make all mrs hagan's boarders leave once again as they returned to her house today our flag of truce came in on the lebanon pike went out on the woodberry pike supposed to puzzle the yankees the yankees would not let the man with the flag see maj saunders a wounded confederate at maj ledbetter's the flag that came in sunday i understand was to see about exchange of prisoners col saunders for a col our men had captured over at lebanon a dead body came in today supposed to be one of their officers thursday july 24th 1862 it was a mistake about it being an officer it was a lady that had died in the asylum near nashville her husband was taking her remains home to ala i never saw the two yankees that took breakfast here neither did i eat with our guard at dinner old nelson says all can pass through the pickets except confederate soldiers he has granted permission to open all stores sell goods if they wish someone applied to him to give a negro ball but he said he did not come here for that purpose that he was not going to let his soldiers have sweethearts in town one of the guards said old nelson beat one of his soldiers over the head several times on the march because he was asleep didn't get out of his way soon enough because a lieut didn't come as soon as he thought he ought to have done so ordered his arrest if he resisted he was to be shot i'm sure our boys would not stand such treatment as that it was true about forrest going into nashville yesterday i am very sorry i hope he will yet possess nashville friday morning this morning our guards came back only a few moments however then left just after i had finished dinner pa went to the farm today came back quite sick but is better tonight bettie i went up to tell kate marchbanks goodbye as she is going to leave in the morning expects to be gone 2 months she went up to mrs crockett's to see our sick soldiers with us and then stopped at mrs hicks to see mr smith then at mrs henderson's corner told kate goodbye saw capt frost he insisted on our going in to see his wife who is quite ill we stopped a few moments now for the rumors reports in the first place gen nelson is to leave here for louisville ky he has gone out this afternoon to hunt forrest it is reported that forrest has killed quite a number of yankees took many prisoners i heard that old washburn wanted to have dr king arrested but genl nelson cursed him would not do it he seems to have little confidence in these union men the reeves were quite angry for taking their cow sent for the guard but it did not come to their assistance one of them went up to tell the genl about it but she received poor comfort especially when she mentioned rounds parkhurst saturday july 26th 1862 mrs tom johnson was arrested nelson says she is a spy because she come into town so often she is at mrs wendle's with a guard the yankees still keep tramping down the pike sunday july 27th 1862 the yanks expected an attack last night were in battle array all night before our house this morning 3 of them came over and got their breakfast the two guards and another they seemed quite freted with genl nelson for keeping them on horseback all night then sent word to feed their horses themselves by 8 o'clock not a mouthful did they have for either horse or themselves they left before bettie i went down to breakfast as usual the yankees left and marched down the pike this morning mr john burton mr peter duffer came out to see pa a little while mr b had just returned from nashville on parole kate avent came home with rosa is spending the night they brought the news of uncle ephraim's arrest he should have gone back ere this to our southern army for we need every man ma cousin ann ephe went out to uncle tom turner's this evening when they returned heard of uncle ephe's arrest went to see him william tilford his two nephews are in prison also aunt judy kate are spending the night here the canons were fired in upon quite a disturbance was made the canons placed upon the square troops rushing up and down furiously we expected an attack every minute but about 11 o'clock i became so sleepy i had to retire i am twenty years old today getting quite ancient monday july 28th 1862 aunt judy kate left early this morning ma was up to the prison sent the prisoners something to eat kate avent went home this evening bettie i paid several pleasant visits this morning one on miss saunders of ala who is at col ledbetter's with her father who is wounded there from there went to pa's store then to dr robt wendle's from there to mrs jno a crockett's to see a wounded soldier a texas ranger who seems to be quite a nice fellow so far as i can judge kate marchbanks came out and is spending the night mr mrs anderson brought her in their buggy while we were standing out on the porch a yankee walked up bowed asked if we were the ladies of the house i replied no she was out at the gate ma came in he introduced himself as genl hanson came to enquire what ma knew about the household things that mrs champ had torn up by the yankees when ma got through said he would allow mrs champ 300 to be collected some time which i expect means never i have no confidence in any of them ma says he seems very polite he is the same one that aunt judy lytle was making such a fuss about being so polite at her house he left before supper our two guards two others came here to supper with us tuesday morning july 29th 62 kate marchbanks left soon after breakfast ma went up took one of our prisoners some clothes each men sent provisions to them will tilford nephews were released to day also mrs tom johnson ma was to see our sick soldiers at mrs arnold's today bro john was in took dinner with us ma says he does not fancy wm riddell much kate marchbanks leaves tomorrow old mr fritz is quite sick tonight wednesday morning july 30th 62 soldiers were both going coming today nothing of interest especially the soldiers annoy us a great deal by their stealing in the garden i understand the yankees that went to mcminnville are on their way back without accomplishing anything we haven't heard the result from tulahoma yet i hope our men were victorious i heard that the confederates had burnt genl mitchell's cotton at some little town took three hundred prisoners ma cousin ann went up town this afternoon bettie i made a beautiful bouquet sent it to our sick soldier at mrs crockett's sent us word he was not so well today talked too much yesterday i'm glad bettie i did not call there monday morning as we always have so much to say old mr fritz is some better today uncle ephe was taken to nashville this evening thursday morning july 31st 62 it has been raining the greater part of the day aunt judy lytle mary willie shoudie richardson took dinner with us also mr jobe he seems to be a good rebel although he has taken the oath he says the yankee deserters are constantly coming in through the country it is reported 7 thousand more men are coming in tonight but many will leave tomorrow i wish all were going off
january 1 1864 general hood's an awful flatterer i mean an awkward flatterer i told him to praise my husband to some one else not to me he ought to praise me to somebody who would tell my husband and then praise my husband to another person who would tell me man and wife are too much one person to wave a compliment straight in the face of one about the other is not graceful one more year of stonewall would have saved us chickamauga is the only battle we have gained since stonewall died and no results follow as usual stonewall was not so much as killed by a yankee he was shot by his own men that is hard general lee can do no more than keep back meade one of meade's armies you mean said i for they have only to double on him when lee whips one of them general edward johnston says he got grant a place esprit de corps you know he could not bear to see an old army man driving a wagon that was when he found him out west put out of the army for habitual drunkenness he is their right man a bull headed suwarrow he don't care a snap if men fall like the leaves fall he fights to win that chap does he is not distracted by a thousand side issues he does not see them he is narrow and sure sees only in a straight line like louis napoleon from a battle in the gutter he goes straight up yes as with lincoln they have ceased to carp at him as a rough clown no gentleman etc you never hear now of lincoln's nasty fun only of his wisdom doesn't take much soap and water to wash the hands that the rod of empire sway they talked of lincoln's drunkenness too now since vicksburg they have not a word to say against grant's habits he has the disagreeable habit of not retreating before irresistible veterans general lee and albert sidney johnston show blood and breeding they are of the bayard and philip sidney order of soldiers listen if general lee had had grant's resources he would have bagged the last yankee or have had them all safe back in massachusetts you mean if he had not the weight of the negro question upon him no i mean if he had grant's unlimited allowance of the powers of war men money ammunition arms mrs ould says mrs lincoln found the gardener of the white house so nice she would make him a major general lincoln remarked to the secretary well the little woman must have her way sometimes a word of the last night of the old year gloria mundi sent me a cup of strong good coffee i drank two cups and so i did not sleep a wink like a fool i passed my whole life in review and bitter memories maddened me quite then came a happy thought i mapped out a story of the war the plot came to hand for it was true johnny is the hero a light dragoon and heavy swell i will call it f f s for it is the f f s both of south carolina and virginia it is to be a war story and the filling out of the skeleton was the best way to put myself to sleep january 4th mrs ives wants us to translate a french play a genuine french captain came in from his ship on the james river and gave us good advice as to how to make the selection general hampton sent another basket of partridges and all goes merry as a marriage bell my husband came in and nearly killed us he brought this piece of news north carolina wants to offer terms of peace we needed only a break of that kind to finish us i really shivered nervously as one does when the first handful of earth comes rattling down on the coffin in the grave of one we cared for more than all who are left january 5th at mrs preston's met the light brigade in battle array ready to sally forth conquering and to conquer they would stand no nonsense from me about staying at home to translate a french play indeed the plays that have been sent us are so indecent i scarcely know where a play is to be found that would do at all while at dinner the president's carriage drove up with only general hood he sent up to ask in maggie howell's name would i go with them i tied up two partridges between plates with a serviette for buck who is ill and then went down we picked up mary preston it was maggie's drive as the soldiers say i was only on escort duty at the prestons major venable met us at the door and took in the partridges to buck as we drove off maggie said major venable is a carolinian i see no virginian to the core but then he was a professor in the south carolina college before the war mary preston said she is taking a fling at your weakness for all south carolina came home and found my husband in a bitter mood it has all gone wrong with our world the loss of our private fortune the smallest part he intimates with so much human misery filling the air we might stay at home and think and go mad said i catch me at it a yawning grave with piles of red earth thrown on one side that is the only future i ever see you remember emma stockton she and i were as blithe as birds that day at mulberry i came here the next day and when i arrived a telegram said emma stockton found dead in her bed it is awfully near that thought no no i will not stop and think of death always january 8th snow of the deepest nobody can come to day i thought but they did my girls first then constance cary tripped in the clever conny hetty is the beauty so called though she is clever enough too but constance is actually clever and has a classically perfect outline next came the four kentuckians and preston hampton he is as tall as the kentuckians and ever so much better looking then we had egg nog i was to take miss cary to the semmes's my husband inquired the price of a carriage it was twenty five dollars an hour he cursed by all his gods at such extravagance the play was not worth the candle or carriage in this instance in confederate money it sounds so much worse than it is i did not dream of asking him to go with me after that lively overture i did intend to go with you he said but you do not ask me and i have been asking you for twenty years to go with me in vain think of that i said tragically we could not wait for him to dress so i sent the twenty five dollar an hour carriage back for him we were behind time as it was when he came the beautiful hetty cary and her friend captain tucker were with him major von borcke and preston hampton were at the cary's in the drawing room when we called for constance who was dressing i challenge the world to produce finer specimens of humanity than these three the prussian von borcke preston hampton and hetty cary we spoke to the prussian about the vote of thanks passed by congress yesterday thanks of the country to major von borcke the poor man was as modest as a girl in spite of his huge proportions that is a compliment indeed said hetty yes i saw it and the happiest the proudest day of my life as i read it it was at the hotel breakfast table i try to hide my face with the newspaper i feel it grow so red but my friend he has his newspaper too and he sees the same thing so he looks my way he says pointing to me why does he grow so red he has got something there and he laughs then i try to read aloud the so kind compliments of the congress but he you i can not he puts his hand to his throat his broken english and the difficulty of his enunciation with that wound in his windpipe makes it all very touching and very hard to understand the semmes charade party was a perfect success the play was charming sweet little mrs lawson clay had a seat for me banked up among women the female part of the congregation strictly segregated from the male were placed all together in rows they formed a gay parterre edged by the men in their black coats and gray uniforms toward the back part of the room the mass of black and gray was solid captain tucker bewailed his fate he was stranded out there with those forlorn men but could see us laughing and fancied what we were saying was worth a thousand charades he preferred talking to a clever woman to any known way of passing a pleasant hour so do i somebody said on a sofa of state in front of all sat the president and mrs davis little maggie davis was one of the child actresses her parents had a right to be proud of her with her flashing black eyes she was a marked figure on the stage she is a handsome creature and she acted her part admirably the shrine was beautiful beyond words the semmes and ives families are roman catholics and understand getting up that sort of thing first came the palmers gray then mrs ives a solitary figure the loveliest of penitent women the eastern pilgrims were delightfully costumed we could not understand how so much christian piety could come clothed in such odalisque robes mrs ould as a queen was as handsome and regal as heart could wish for she was accompanied by a very satisfactory king whose name if i ever knew i have forgotten there was a resplendent knight of st john and then an american indian after their orisons they all knelt and laid something on the altar as a votive gift burton harrison the president's handsome young secretary was gotten up as a big brave in a dress presented to mr davis by indians for some kindness he showed them years ago it was a complete warrior's outfit scant as that is the feathers stuck in the back of mr harrison's head had a charmingly comic effect he had to shave himself as clean as a baby or he could not act the beardless chief spotted tail billy bowlegs big thunder or whatever his character was so he folded up his loved and lost mustache the christianized red indian and laid it on the altar the most sacred treasure of his life the witness of his most heroic sacrifice on the shrine senator hill of georgia took me in to supper where were ices chicken salad oysters and champagne the president came in alone i suppose for while we were talking after supper and your humble servant was standing between mrs randolph and mrs stanard he approached offered me his arm and we walked off oblivious of mr senator hill remember this ladies and forgive me for recording it but mrs stanard and mrs randolph are the handsomest women in richmond i am no older than they are or younger either sad to say now the president walked with me slowly up and down that long room and our conversation was of the saddest nobody knows so well as he the difficulties which beset this hard driven confederacy he has a voice which is perfectly modulated a comfort in this loud and rough soldier world i think there is a melancholy cadence in his voice at times of which he is unconscious when he talks of things as they are now my husband was so intensely charmed with hetty cary that he declined at the first call to accompany his wife home in the twenty five dollar an hour carriage he ordered it to return when it came his wife a good manager packed the carys and him in with herself leaving the other two men who came with the party when it was divided into trips to make their way home in the cold at our door near daylight of that bitter cold morning i had the pleasure to see my husband like a man stand and pay for that carriage to day he is pleased with himself with me and with all the world says if there was no such word as fascinating you would have to invent one to describe hetty cary january 9th met mrs wigfall she wants me to take halsey to mrs randolph's theatricals i am to get him up as sir walter raleigh now general breckinridge has come i like him better than any of them morgan also is here 1 these huge kentuckians fill the town isabella says they hold morgan accountable for the loss of chattanooga the follies of the wise the weaknesses of the great she shakes her head significantly when i beg in to tell why i like him so well last night general buckner came for her to go with him and rehearse at the carys for mrs randolph's charades the president's man jim that he believed in as we all believe in our own servants our own people as we call them and betsy mrs davis's maid decamped last night it is miraculous that they had the fortitude to resist the temptation so long at mrs davis's the hired servants all have been birds of passage first they were seen with gold galore and then they would fly to the yankees and i am sure they had nothing to tell it is yankee money wasted i do not think it had ever crossed mrs davis's brain that these two could leave her she knew however that betsy had eighty dollars in gold and two thousand four hundred dollars in confederate notes everybody who comes in brings a little bad news not much in itself but by cumulative process the effect is depressing indeed january 12th to night there will be a great gathering of kentuckians morgan gives them a dinner the city of richmond entertains john morgan he is at free quarters the girls dined here conny cary came back for more white feathers isabella had appropriated two sets and obstinately refused constance cary a single feather from her pile she said sternly i have never been on the stage before and i have a presentiment when my father hears of this i will never go again i am to appear before the footlights as an english dowager duchess and i mean to rustle in every feather to wear all the lace and diamonds these two houses can compass mine and mrs preston's she was jolly but firm and constance departed without any additional plumage for her lady teazle january 14th gave mrs white twenty three dollars for a turkey came home wondering all the way why she did not ask twenty five two more dollars could not have made me balk at the bargain and twenty three sounds odd january 15th what a day the kentuckians have had mrs webb gave them a breakfast from there they proceeded en masse to general lawton's dinner and then came straight here all of which seems equal to one of stonewall's forced marches general lawton took me in to supper in spite of his dinner he had misgivings my heart is heavy said he even here all seems too light too careless for such terrible times it seems out of place here in battle scarred richmond i have heard something of that kind at home i replied hope and fear are both gone and it is distraction or death with us i do not see how sadness and despondency would help us if it would do any good we would be sad enough we laughed at general hood general lawton thought him better fitted for gallantry on the battle field than playing a lute in my lady's chamber when miss giles was electrifying the audience as the fair penitent some one said oh that is so pretty hood cried out with stern reproachfulness that is not pretty it is elegant not only had my house been rifled for theatrical properties but as the play went on they came for my black velvet cloak when it was over i thought i should never get away my cloak was so hard to find but it gave me an opportunity to witness many things behind the scenes that cloak hunt did behind the scenes i know a little what that means now general jeb stuart was at mrs randolph's in his cavalry jacket and high boots he was devoted to hetty cary constance cary said to me pointing to his stars hetty likes them that way you know gilt edged and with stars january 16th a visit from the president's handsome and accomplished secretary burton harrison i lent him country clergyman in town and elective affinities he is to bring me mrs norton's lost and saved at mrs randolph's my husband complimented one of the ladies who had amply earned his praise by her splendid acting she pointed to a young man saying you see that wretch he has not said one word to me my husband asked innocently why should he and why is he a wretch oh you know going home i explained this riddle to him he is always a year behindhand in gossip they said those two were engaged last winter and now there seems to be a screw loose but that sort of thing always comes right the carys prefer james chesnut to his wife i don't mind indeed i like it i do too every sunday mr minnegerode cried aloud in anguish his litany from pestilence and famine battle murder and sudden death and we wailed on our knees good lord deliver us and on monday and all the week long we go on as before hearing of nothing but battle murder and sudden death which are daily events now i have a new book that is the unlooked for thing a pleasing incident in this life of monotonous misery we live in a huge barrack we are shut in guarded from light without at breakfast to day came a card and without an instant's interlude perhaps the neatest most fastidious man in south carolina walked in i was uncombed unkempt tattered and torn in my most comfortable worst worn wadded green silk dressing gown with a white woolen shawl over my head to keep off draughts he has not been in the war yet and now he wants to be captain of an engineer corps i wish he may get it he has always been my friend so he shall lack no aid that i can give if he can stand the shock of my appearance to day we may reasonably expect to continue friends until death of all men the fastidious barny heywood to come in he faced the situation gallantly january 18th invited to dr haxall's last night to meet the lawtons mr benjamin1 dropped in he is a friend of the house mrs haxall is a richmond leader of society a ci devant beauty and belle a charming person still and her hospitality is of the genuine virginia type everything mr benjamin said we listened to bore in mind and gave heed to it diligently he is a delphic oracle of the innermost shrine and is supposed to enjoy the honor of mr davis's unreserved confidence lamar was asked to dinner here yesterday so he came to day we had our wild turkey cooked for him yesterday and i dressed myself within an inch of my life with the best of my four year old finery two of us my husband and i did not damage the wild turkey seriously so lamar enjoyed the réchauffé and commended the art with which molly had hid the slight loss we had inflicted upon its mighty breast she had piled fried oysters over the turkey so skilfully that unless we had told about it no one would ever have known that the huge bird was making his second appearance on the board lamar was more absent minded and distrait than ever my husband behaved like a trump a well bred man with all his wits about him so things went off smoothly enough lamar had just read romola across the water he said it was the rage i am sure it is not as good as adam bede or silas marner it is not worthy of the woman who was to rival all but shakespeare's name below what is the matter with romola he asked tito is so mean and he is mean in such a very mean way and the end is so repulsive petting the husband's illegitimate children and left handed wives may be magnanimity but human nature revolts at it woman's nature you mean yes and now another test two weeks ago i read this thing with intense interest and already her savonarola has faded from my mind i have forgotten her way of showing savonarola as completely as i always do forget bulwer's rienzi oh i understand you now it is like milton's devil he has obliterated all other devils you can't fix your mind upon any other the devil always must be of miltonic proportions or you do not believe in him goethe's mephistopheles disputes the crown of the causeway with lucifer but soon you begin to feel that mephistopheles to be a lesser devil an emissary of the devil only is there any cardinal wolsey but shakespeare's any mirabeau but carlyle's mirabeau but the list is too long of those who have been stamped into your brain by genius the saintly preacher the woman who stands by hetty and saves her soul those heavenly minded sermons preached by the author of adam bede bear them well in mind while i tell you how this writer who so well imagines and depicts female purity and piety was a governess or something of that sort and perhaps wrote for a living at any rate she had an elective affinity which was responded to by george lewes and so she lives with lewes i do not know that she caused the separation between lewes and his legal wife they are living in a villa on some swiss lake and mrs lewes of the hour is a charitable estimable agreeable sympathetic woman of genius lamar seemed without prejudices on the subject at least he expressed neither surprise nor disapprobation he said something of genius being above law but i was not very clear as to what he said on that point as for me i said nothing for fear of saying too much you know that lewes is a writer said he some people say the man she lives with is a noble man they say she is kind and good if a fallen woman here the conversation ended january 20th and now comes a grand announcement made by the yankee congress they vote one million of men to be sent down here to free the prisoners whom they will not take in exchange i actually thought they left all these yankees here on our hands as part of their plan to starve us out all congressmen under fifty years of age are to leave politics and report for military duty or be conscripted what enthusiasm there is in their councils confusion rather it seems to me mrs ould says the men who frequent her house are more despondent now than ever since this thing began our congress is so demoralized so confused so depressed they have asked the president whom they have so hated so insulted so crossed and opposed and thwarted in every way to speak to them and advise them what to do january 21st both of us were too ill to attend mrs davis's reception it proved a very sensational one first a fire in the house then a robbery said to be an arranged plan of the usual bribed servants there and some escaped yankee prisoners to day the examiner is lost in wonder at the stupidity of the fire and arson contingent if they had only waited a few hours until everybody was asleep after a reception the household would be so tired and so sound asleep thanks to the editor's kind counsel maybe the arson contingent will wait and do better next time letters from home carried mr chesnut off to day thackeray is dead i stumbled upon vanity fair for myself i had never heard of thackeray before i think it was in 1850 i know i had been ill at the new york hotel 1 and when left alone i slipped down stairs and into a bookstore that i had noticed under the hotel for something to read they gave me the first half of pendennis i can recall now the very kind of paper it was printed on and the illustrations as they took effect upon me and yet when i raved over it and was wild for the other half there were people who said it was slow that thackeray was evidently a coarse dull sneering writer that he stripped human nature bare and made it repulsive etc january 22d at mrs lyons's met another beautiful woman mrs penn the wife of colonel penn who is making shoes in a yankee prison she had a little son with her barely two years old a mere infant she said to him faites comme butler the child crossed his eyes and made himself hideous then laughed and rioted around as if he enjoyed the joke hugely went to mrs davis's it was sad enough fancy having to be always ready to have your servants set your house on fire being bribed to do it such constant robberies such servants coming and going daily to the yankees carrying one's silver one's other possessions does not conduce to home happiness saw hood on his legs once more he rode off on a fine horse and managed it well though he is disabled in one hand too after all as the woman said he has body enough left to hold his soul how plucky of him to ride a gay horse like that oh a kentuckian prides himself upon being half horse and half man and the girl who rode beside him did you ever see a more brilliant beauty three cheers for south carolina i imparted a plan of mine to brewster i would have a breakfast a luncheon a matinee call it what you please but i would try and return some of the hospitalities of this most hospitable people just think of the dinners suppers breakfasts we have been to people have no variety in war times but they make up for that lack in exquisite cooking variety said he you are hard to please with terrapin stew gumbo fish oysters in every shape game and wine as good as wine ever is i do not mention juleps claret cup apple toddy whisky punches and all that i tell you it is good enough for me variety would spoil it such hams as these virginia people cure such home made bread there is no such bread in the world call yours a cold collation yes i have eggs butter hams game everything from home no stint just now even fruit you ought to do your best they are so generous and hospitable and so unconscious of any merit or exceptional credit in the matter of hospitality they are no better than the columbia people always were to us so i fired up for my own country january 23d my luncheon was a female affair exclusively mrs davis came early and found annie and tudie making the chocolate lawrence had gone south with my husband so we had only molly for cook and parlor maid after the company assembled we waited and waited those girls were making the final arrangements i made my way to the door and as i leaned against it ready to turn the knob mrs stanard held me like coleridge's ancient mariner and told how she had been prevented by a violent attack of cramps from running the blockade and how providential it all was all this floated by my ear for i heard mary preston's voice raised in high protest on the other side of the door stop said she do you mean to take away the whole dish if you eat many more of those fried oysters they will be missed heavens she is running away with a plug a palpable plug out of that jelly cake later in the afternoon when it was over and i was safe for all had gone well and molly had not disgraced herself before the mistresses of those wonderful virginia cooks mrs davis and i went out for a walk barny heyward and dr garnett joined us the latter bringing the welcome news that muscoe russell's wife had come january 25th the president walked home with me from church i was to dine with mrs davis he walked so fast i had no breath to talk so i was a good listener for once the truth is i am too much afraid of him to say very much in his presence we had such a nice dinner after dinner hood came for a ride with the president mr hunter of virginia walked home with me he made himself utterly agreeable by dwelling on his friendship and admiration of my husband he said it was high time mr davis should promote him and that he had told mr davis his opinion on that subject to day tuesday barny heyward went with me to the president's reception and from there to a ball at the mcfarlands breckinridge alone of the generals went with us the others went to a supper given by mr clay of alabama i had a long talk with mr ould mr benjamin and mr hunter these men speak out their thoughts plainly enough what they said means we are rattling down hill and nobody to put on the brakes i wore my black velvet diamonds and point lace they are borrowed for all theatricals but i wear them whenever they are at home
january 7th sherman is at hardieville and hood in tennessee the last of his men not gone as louis wigfall so cheerfully prophesied serena went for a half hour to day to the dentist her teeth are of the whitest and most regular simply perfection she fancied it was better to have a dentist look in her mouth before returning to the mountains for that look she paid three hundred and fifty dollars in confederate money why has this money any value at all she asked little enough in all truth sad to say brewster was here and stayed till midnight said he must see general chesnut he had business with him his me and general hood is no longer comic he described sherman's march of destruction and desolation sherman leaves a track fifty miles wide upon which there is no living thing to be seen said brewster before he departed january 10th you do the anabasis business when you want to get out of the enemy's country and the thermopylae business when they want to get into your country but we retreated in our own country and we gave up our mountain passes without a blow but never mind the greeks if we had only our own game cock sumter our own swamp fox marion marion's men or sumter's or the equivalent of them now lie under the sod in virginia or tennessee january 14th yesterday i broke down gave way to abject terror under the news of sherman's advance with no news of my husband to day while wrapped up on the sofa too dismal even for moaning there was a loud knock shawls on and all just as i was i rushed to the door to find a telegram from my husband all well be at home tuesday it was dated from adam's run i felt as lighthearted as if the war were over then i looked at the date and the place adam's run it ends as it began in a run bull's run from which their first sprightly running astounded the world and now adam's run but if we must run who are left to run from bull run they ran full handed but we have fought until maimed soldiers women and children are all that remain to run to day kershaw's brigade or what is left of it passed through what shouts greeted it and what bold shouts of thanks it returned it was all a very encouraging noise absolutely comforting some true men are left after all january 16th my husband is at home once more for how long i do not know his aides fill the house and a group of hopelessly wounded haunt the place the drilling and the marching go on outside it rains a flood with freshet after freshet the forces of nature are befriending us for our enemies have to make their way through swamps a month ago my husband wrote me a letter which i promptly suppressed after showing it to mrs mccord he warned us to make ready for the end had come our resources were exhausted and the means of resistance could not be found we could not bring ourselves to believe it and now he thinks with the railroad all blown up the swamps made impassable by the freshets which have no time to subside so constant is the rain and the negroes utterly apathetic would they be so if they saw us triumphant if we had but an army to seize the opportunity we might do something but there are no troops that is the real trouble to day mrs mccord exchanged 16,000 in confederate bills for 300 in gold sixteen thousand for three hundred january 17th the bazaar for the benefit of the hospitals opens now sherman marches constantly all the railroads are smashed and if i laugh at any mortal thing it is that i may not weep generals are as plenty as blackberries but none are in command the peace commissioner blair came they say he gave mr davis the kiss of peace and we send stephens campbell all who have believed in this thing to negotiate for peace no hope no good who dares hope repressed excitement in church a great railroad character was called out he soon returned and whispered something to joe johnston and they went out together somehow the whisper moved around to us that sherman was at branchville grant us patience good lord was prayed aloud not ulysses grant good lord murmured teddy profanely hood came yesterday he is staying at the prestons with jack they sent for us what a heartfelt greeting he gave us he can stand well enough without his crutch but he does very slow walking how plainly he spoke out dreadful words about my defeat and discomfiture my army destroyed my losses etc etc he said he had nobody to blame but himself a telegram from beauregard to day to my husband he does not know whether sherman intends to advance on branchville charleston or columbia isabella said maybe you attempted the impossible and began one of her merriest stories jack preston touched me on the arm and we slipped out he did not hear a word she was saying he has forgotten us all did you notice how he stared in the fire and the lurid spots which came out in his face and the drops of perspiration that stood on his forehead yes he is going over some bitter scene he sees willie preston with his heart shot away he sees the panic at nashville and the dead on the battlefield at franklin that agony on his face comes again and again said tender hearted jack i can't keep him out of those absent fits governor mcgrath and general winder talk of preparations for a defense of columbia if beauregard can't stop sherman down there what have we got here to do it with can we cheek or impede his march can any one last night general hampton came in i am sure he would do something to save us if he were put in supreme command here hampton says joe johnston is equal if not superior to lee as a commanding officer my silver is in a box and has been delivered for safe keeping to isaac mclaughlin who is really my beau ideal of a grateful negro i mean to trust him my husband cares for none of these things now and lets me do as i please tom archer died almost as soon as he got to richmond prison takes the life out of men he was only half alive when here he had a strange pallid look and such a vacant stare until you roused him poor pretty sally archer that is the end of you 1
october 24th james chesnut is at home on his way back to richmond had been sent by the president to make the rounds of the western armies says polk is a splendid old fellow they accuse him of having been asleep in his tent at seven o'clock when he was ordered to attack at daylight but he has too good a conscience to sleep so soundly the battle did not begin until eleven at chickamauga1 when bragg had ordered the advance at daylight bragg and his generals do not agree i think a general worthless whose subalterns quarrel with him something is wrong about the man good generals are adored by their soldiers see napoleon cæsar stonewall lee old sam hood received his orders to hold a certain bridge against the enemy and he had already driven the enemy several miles beyond it when the slow generals were still asleep hood has won a victory though he has only one leg to stand on mr chesnut was with the president when he reviewed our army under the enemy's guns before chattanooga he told mr davis that every honest man he saw out west thought well of joe johnston he knows that the president detests joe johnston for all the trouble he has given him and general joe returns the compliment with compound interest his hatred of jeff davis amounts to a religion with him it colors all things joe johnston advancing or retreating i may say with more truth is magnetic he does draw the good will of those by whom he is surrounded being such a good hater it is a pity he had not elected to hate somebody else than the president of our country he hates not wisely but too well our friend breckinridge1 received mr chesnut with open arms there is nothing narrow nothing self seeking about breckinridge he has not mounted a pair of green spectacles made of prejudices so that he sees no good except in his own red hot partizans october 27th young wade hampton has been here for a few days a guest of our nearest neighbor and cousin phil stockton wade without being the beauty or the athlete that his brother preston is is such a nice boy we lent him horses and ended by giving him a small party what was lacking in company was made up for by the excellence of old colonel chesnut's ancient madeira and champagne if everything in the confederacy were only as truly good as the old colonel's wine cellars then we had a salad and a jelly cake general joe johnston is so careful of his aides that wade has never yet seen a battle says he has always happened to be sent afar off when the fighting came he does not seem too grateful for this and means to be transferred to his father's command he says no man exposes himself more recklessly to danger than general johnston and no one strives harder to keep others out of it but the business of this war is to save the country and a commander must risk his men's lives to do it there is a french saying that you can't make an omelet unless you are willing to break eggs
october 1st mary cantey preston's wedding day has come and gone and mary is mrs john darby now maggie howell dressed the bride's hair beautifully they said but it was all covered by her veil which was of blond lace and the dress tulle and blond lace with diamonds and pearls the bride walked up the aisle on her father's arm mrs preston on dr darby's i think it was the handsomest wedding party i ever saw john darby had brought his wedding uniform home with him from england and it did all honor to his perfect figure i forget the name of his london tailor the best of course well said isabella it would be hard for any man to live up to those clothes and now to the amazement of us all captain chesnut johnny who knows everything has rushed into a flirtation with buck such as never was he drives her every day and those wild runaway sorrel colts terrify my soul as they go tearing pitching and darting from side to side of the street and my lady enjoys it when he leaves her he kisses her hand bowing so low to do it unseen that we see it all saturday the president will be with us here in columbia next tuesday so colonel mclean brings us word i have begun at once to prepare to receive him in my small house his apartments have been decorated as well as confederate stringency would permit the possibilities were not great but i did what i could for our honored chief besides i like the man he has been so kind to me and his wife is one of the few to whom i can never be grateful enough for her generous appreciation and attention i went out to the gate to greet the president who met me most cordially kissed me in fact custis lee and governor lubbock were at his back immediately after breakfast the presidential party arrived a little before daylight general chesnut drove off with the president's aides and mr davis sat out on our piazza there was nobody with him but myself some little boys strolling by called out come here and look there is a man on mrs chesnut's porch who looks just like jeff davis on postage stamps people began to gather at once on the street mr davis then went in mrs mccord sent a magnificent bouquet i thought of course for the president but she gave me such a scolding afterward she did not know he was there i in my mistake about the bouquet thought she knew and so did not send her word the president was watching me prepare a mint julep for custis lee when colonel mclean came to inform us that a great crowd had gathered and that they were coming to ask the president to speak to them at one o'clock an immense crowd it was men women and children the crowd overflowed the house the president's hand was nearly shaken off i went to the rear my head intent on the dinner to be prepared for him with only a confederate commissariat but the patriotic public had come to the rescue i had been gathering what i could of eatables for a month and now i found that nearly everybody in columbia was sending me whatever they had that they thought nice enough for the president's dinner we had the sixty year old madeira from mulberry and the beautiful old china etc mrs preston sent a boned turkey stuffed with truffles stuffed tomatoes and stuffed peppers each made a dish as pretty as it was appetizing a mob of small boys only came to pay their respects to the president he seemed to know how to meet that odd delegation then the president's party had to go and we bade them an affectionate farewell custis lee and i had spent much time gossiping on the back porch while i was concocting dainties for the dessert he sat on the banister with a cigar in his mouth he spoke very candidly telling me many a hard truth for the confederacy and about the bad time which was at hand october 18th ten pleasant days i owe to my sister kate has descended upon me unexpectedly from the mountains of flat rock we are true sisters she understands me without words and she is the cleverest sweetest woman i know so graceful and gracious in manner so good and unselfish in character but best of all she is so agreeable any time or place would be charming with kate for a companion general chesnut was in camden but i could not wait i gave the beautiful bride mrs darby a dinner which was simply perfection i was satisfied for once in my life with my own table and i know pleasanter guests were never seated around any table whatsoever my house is always crowded after all what a number of pleasant people we have been thrown in with by war's catastrophes i call such society glorious it is the windup but the old life as it begins to die will die royally general chesnut came back disheartened he complains that such a life as i lead gives him no time to think october 28th burton harrison writes to general preston that supreme anxiety reigns in richmond oh for one single port if the alabama had had in the whole wide world a port to take her prizes to and where she could be refitted i believe she would have borne us through oh for one single port by which we could get at the outside world and refit our whole confederacy if we could have hired regiments from europe or even have imported ammunition and food for our soldiers some days must be dark and dreary at the mantua maker's however i saw an instance of faith in our future a bride's paraphernalia and the radiant bride herself the bridegroom expectant and elect now within twenty miles of chattanooga and outward bound to face the foe saw at the laurens's not only lizzie hamilton a perfect little beauty but the very table the first declaration of independence was written upon these laurenses are grandchildren of henry laurens of the first revolution alas we have yet to make good our second declaration of independence southern independence from yankee meddling and yankee rule hood has written to ask them to send general chesnut out to command one of his brigades in whose place if albert sidney johnston had lived poor old general lee has no backing stonewall would have saved us from antietam sherman will now catch general lee by the rear while grant holds him by the head and while hood and thomas are performing an indian war dance on the frontier hood means to cut his way to lee see if he doesn't the yanks have had a struggle for it more than once we seemed to have been too much for them we have been so near to success it aches one to think of it so runs the table talk next to our house which isabella calls tillytudlem since mr davis's visit is a common of green grass and very level beyond which comes a belt of pine trees on this open space within forty paces of us a regiment of foreign deserters has camped they have taken the oath of allegiance to our government and are now being drilled and disciplined into form before being sent to our army they are mostly germans with some irish however their close proximity keeps me miserable traitors once traitors forever jordan has always been held responsible for all the foolish proclamations and indeed for whatever beauregard reported or proclaimed now he has left that mighty chief and lo here comes from beauregard the silliest and most boastful of his military bulletins he brags of shiloh that was not the way the story was told to us a letter from mrs davis who says thank you a thousand times my dear friend for your more than maternal kindness to my dear child that is what she calls her sister maggie howell as to mr davis he thinks the best ham the best madeira the best coffee the best hostess in the world rendered columbia delightful to him when he passed through we are in a sad and anxious state here just now the dead come in but the living do not go out so fast however we hope all things and trust in god as the only one able to resolve the opposite state of feeling into a triumphant happy whole i had a surprise of an unusually gratifying nature a few days since i found i could not keep my horses so i sold them the next day they were returned to me with a handsome anonymous note to the effect that they had been bought by a few friends for me but i fear i can not feed them strictly between us things look very anxious here
november 5th for a week we have had such a tranquil happy time here both my husband and johnny are here still james chesnut spent his time sauntering around with his father or stretched on the rug before my fire reading vanity fair and pendennis by good luck he had not read them before we have kept esmond for the last he owns that he is having a good time johnny is happy too he does not care for books he will read a novel now and then if the girls continue to talk of it before him nothing else whatever in the way of literature does he touch he comes pulling his long blond mustache irresolutely as if he hoped to be advised not to read it aunt mary shall i like this thing i do not think he has an idea what we are fighting about and he does not want to know he says my company my men with a pride a faith and an affection which are sublime he came into his inheritance at twenty one just as the war began and it was a goodly one fine old houses and an estate to match yesterday johnny went to his plantation for the first time since the war began john witherspoon went with him and reports in this way how do you do marster how you come on thus from every side rang the noisiest welcome from the darkies johnny was silently shaking black hands right and left as he rode into the crowd as the noise subsided to the overseer he said send down more corn and fodder for my horses and to the driver have you any peas plenty sir send a wagon load down for the cows at bloomsbury while i stay there they have not milk and butter enough there for me any eggs send down all you can collect how about my turkeys and ducks send them down two at a time how about the mutton fat that's good send down two a week as they rode home john witherspoon remarked i was surprised that you did not go into the fields to see your crops what was the use and the negroes you had so little talk with them no use to talk to them before the overseer they are coming down to bloomsbury day and night by platoons and they talk me dead besides william and parish go up there every night and god knows they tell me enough plantation scandal overseer feathering his nest negroes ditto at my expense between the two fires i mean to get something to eat while i am here for him we got up a charming picnic at mulberry everything was propitious the most perfect of days and the old place in great beauty those large rooms were delightful for dancing we had as good a dinner as mortal appetite could crave the best fish fowl and game wine from a cellar that can not be excelled in spite of blockade mulberry does the honors nobly yet mrs edward stockton drove down with me she helped me with her taste and tact in arranging things we had no trouble however all of the old servants who have not been moved to bloomsbury scented the prey from afar and they literally flocked in and made themselves useful richmond va november 28 1863 our pleasant home sojourn was soon broken up johnny had to go back to company a and my husband was ordered by the president to make a second visit to bragg's army 1 so we came on here where the prestons had taken apartments for me molly was with me adam team the overseer with isaac mclaughlin's help came with us to take charge of the eight huge boxes of provisions i brought from home isaac molly's husband is a servant of ours the only one my husband ever bought in his life isaac's wife belonged to rev thomas davis and isaac to somebody else the owner of isaac was about to go west and isaac was distracted they asked one thousand dollars for him he is a huge creature really a magnificent specimen of a colored gentleman his occupation had been that of a stage driver now he is a carpenter or will be some day he is awfully grateful to us for buying him is really devoted to his wife and children though he has a strange way of showing it for he has a mistress en titre as the french say which fact molly never failed to grumble about as soon as his back was turned great big good for nothing thing come a whimpering to marster to buy him for his wife's sake and all the time he an oh molly stop that said i mr davis visited charleston and had an enthusiastic reception he described it all to general preston governor aiken's perfect old carolina style of living delighted him those old gray haired darkies and their noiseless automatic service the result of finished training one does miss that sort of thing when away from home where your own servants think for you they know your ways and your wants they save you all responsibility even in matters of your own ease and well doing the butler at mulberry would be miserable and feel himself a ridiculous failure were i ever forced to ask him for anything november 30th i must describe an adventure i had in kingsville of course i know nothing of children in point of fact am awfully afraid of them mrs edward barnwell came with us from camden she had a magnificent boy two years old now don't expect me to reduce that adjective for this little creature is a wonder of childlike beauty health and strength why not if like produces like and with such a handsome pair to claim as father and mother the boy's eyes alone would make any girl's fortune at first he made himself very agreeable repeating nursery rhymes and singing then something went wrong suddenly he changed to a little fiend fought and kicked and scratched like a tiger he did everything that was naughty and he did it with a will as if he liked it while his lovely mamma with flushed cheeks and streaming eyes was imploring him to be a good boy when we stopped at kingsville i got out first then mrs barnwell's nurse who put the little man down by me look after him a moment please ma'am she said i must help mrs barnwell with the bundles etc she stepped hastily back and the cars moved off they ran down a half mile to turn i trembled in my shoes this child no man could ever frighten me so if he should choose to be bad again it seemed an eternity while i waited for that train to turn and come back again my little charge took things quietly for me he had a perfect contempt no fear whatever and i was his abject slave for the nonce he stretched himself out lazily at full length then he pointed downward those are great legs said he solemnly looking at his own i immediately joined him in admiring them enthusiastically near him he spied a bundle pussy cat tied up in that bundle he was up in a second and pounced upon it if we were to be taken up as thieves no matter i dared not meddle with that child i had seen what he could do there were several cooked sweet potatoes tied up in an old handkerchief belonging to some negro probably he squared himself off comfortably broke one in half and began to eat evidently he had found what he was fond of in this posture mrs barnwell discovered us she came with comic dismay in every feature not knowing what our relations might be and whether or not we had undertaken to fight it out alone as best we might the old nurse cried lawsy me with both hands uplifted without a word i fled in another moment the wilmington train would have left me she was going to columbia we broke down only once between kingsville and wilmington but between wilmington and weldon we contrived to do the thing so effectually as to have to remain twelve hours at that forlorn station the one room that i saw was crowded with soldiers adam team succeeded in securing two chairs for me upon one of which i sat and put my feet on the other molly sat flat on the floor resting her head against my chair i woke cold and cramped an officer who did not give his name but said he was from louisiana came up and urged me to go near the fire he gave me his seat by the fire where i found an old lady and two young ones with two men in the uniform of common soldiers we talked as easily to each other all night as if we had known one another all our lives we discussed the war the army the news of the day no questions were asked no names given no personal discourse whatever and yet if these men and women were not gentry and of the best sort i do not know ladies and gentlemen when i see them being a little surprised at the want of interest mr team and isaac showed in my well doing i walked out to see and i found them working like beavers they had been at it all night in the break down my boxes were smashed they had first gathered up the contents and were trying to hammer up the boxes so as to make them once more available at petersburg a smartly dressed woman came in looked around in the crowd then asked for the seat by me now molly's seat was paid for the same as mine but she got up at once gave the lady her seat and stood behind me i am sure molly believes herself my body guard as well as my servant the lady then having arranged herself comfortably in molly's seat began in plaintive accents to tell her melancholy tale she was a widow she lost her husband in the battles around richmond soon some one went out and a man offered her the vacant seat straight as an arrow she went in for a flirtation with the polite gentleman another person a perfect stranger said to me well look yonder as soon as she began whining about her dead beau i knew she was after another one beau indeed cried another listener she said it was her husband husband or lover all the same she won't lose any time it won't be her fault if she doesn't have another one soon but the grand scene was the night before the cars crowded with soldiers of course not a human being that i knew an irish woman so announced by her brogue came in she marched up and down the car loudly lamenting the want of gallantry in the men who would not make way for her two men got up and gave her their seats saying it did not matter they were going to get out at the next stopping place she was gifted with the most pronounced brogue i ever heard and she gave us a taste of it she continued to say that the men ought all to get out of that that car was shuteable only for ladies she placed on the vacant seat next to her a large looking glass she continued to harangue until she fell asleep a tired soldier coming in seeing what he supposed to be an empty seat quietly slipped into it crash went the glass the soldier groaned the irish woman shrieked the man was badly cut by the broken glass she was simply a mad woman she shook her fist in his face said she was a lone woman and he had got into that seat for no good purpose how did he dare to etc i do not think the man uttered a word the conductor took him into another car to have the pieces of glass picked out of his clothes and she continued to rave mr team shouted aloud and laughed as if he were in the hermitage swamp the woman's unreasonable wrath and absurd accusations were comic no doubt soon the car was silent and i fell into a comfortable doze i felt molly give me a gentle shake listen missis how loud mars adam team is talking and all about ole marster and our business and to strangers it's a shame is he saying any harm of us no ma'am not that he is bragging for dear life bout how ole ole marster is and how rich he is an all that i gwine tell him stop up started molly mars adam missis say please don't talk so loud when people travel they don't do that a way mr preston's man hal was waiting at the depot with a carriage to take me to my richmond house mary preston had rented these apartments for me i found my dear girls there with a nice fire everything looked so pleasant and inviting to the weary traveler mrs grundy who occupies the lower floor sent me such a real virginia tea hot cakes and rolls think of living in the house with mrs grundy and having no fear of what mrs grundy will say my husband has come he likes the house grundy's and everything already he has bought grundy's horses for sixteen hundred confederate dollars cash he is nearer to being contented and happy than i ever saw him he has not established a grievance yet but i am on the lookout daily he will soon find out whatever there is wrong about cary street i gave a party mrs davis very witty preston girls very handsome isabella's fun fast and furious no party could have gone off more successfully but my husband decides we are to have no more festivities this is not the time or the place for such gaieties maria freeland is perfectly delightful on the subject of her wedding she is ready to the last piece of lace but her hard hearted father says no she adores john lewis that goes without saying she does not pretend however to be as much in love as mary preston in point of fact she never saw any one before who was but she is as much in love as she can be with a man who though he is not very handsome is as eligible a match as a girl could make he is all that heart could wish and he comes of such a handsome family his mother esther maria coxe was the beauty of a century and his father was a nephew of general washington for all that he is far better looking than john darby or mr miles she always intended to marry better than mary preston or bettie bierne lucy haxall is positively engaged to captain coffey an englishman she is convinced that she will marry him he is her first fancy mr venable of lee's staff was at our party so out of spirits he knows everything that is going on his depression bodes us no good to day general hampton sent james chesnut a fine saddle that he had captured from the yankees in battle array mrs scotch allan edgar allan poe's patron's wife sent me ice cream and lady cheek apples from her farm john r thompson 1 the sole literary fellow i know in richmond sent me leisure hours in town by a country parson my husband says he hopes i will be contented because he came here this winter to please me if i could have been satisfied at home he would have resigned his aide de campship and gone into some service in south carolina i am a good excuse if good for nothing else old tempestuous keitt breakfasted with us yesterday i wish i could remember half the brilliant things he said my husband has now gone with him to the war office colonel keitt thinks it is time he was promoted he wants to be a brigadier now charleston is bombarded night and day it fairly makes me dizzy to think of that everlasting racket they are beating about people's ears down there bragg defeated and separated from longstreet it is a long street that knows no turning and rosecrans is not taken after all november 30th anxiety pervades lee is fighting meade misery is everywhere bragg is falling back before grant 2 longstreet the soldiers call him peter the slow is settling down before knoxville general lee requires us to answer every letter said mr venable and to do our best to console the poor creatures whose husbands and sons are fighting the battles of the country
november 6th sally hampton went to richmond with the rev mr martin she arrived there on wednesday on thursday her father wade hampton fought a great battle but just did not win it a victory narrowly missed darkness supervened and impenetrable woods prevented that longed for consummation preston hampton rode recklessly into the hottest fire his father sent his brother wade to bring him back wade saw him reel in the saddle and galloped up to him general hampton following as young wade reached him preston fell from his horse and the one brother stooping to raise the other was himself shot down preston recognized his father but died without speaking a word young wade though wounded held his brother's head up tom taylor and others hurried up the general took his dead son in his arms kissed him and handed his body to tom taylor and his friends bade them take care of wade and then rode back to his post at the head of his troops in the thickest of the fray he directed the fight for the rest of the day until night he did not know young wade's fate that boy might be dead too now he says no son of his must be in his command when wade recovers he must join some other division the agony of such a day and the anxiety and the duties of the battle field it is all more than a mere man can bear another letter from mrs davis she says i was dreadfully shocked at preston hampton's fate his untimely fate i know nothing more touching in history than general hampton's situation at the supremest moment of his misery when he sent one son to save the other and saw both fall and could not know for some moments whether both were not killed a thousand dollars have slipped through my fingers already this week at the commissary's i spent five hundred to day for candles sugar and a lamp etc tallow candles are bad enough but of them there seems to be an end too now we are restricted to smoky terrabine lamps terrabine is a preparation of turpentine when the chimney of the lamp cracks as crack it will we plaster up the place with paper thick old letter paper preferring the highly glazed kind in the hunt for paper queer old letters come to light sherman in atlanta has left thomas to take care of hood hood has thirty thousand men thomas forty thousand and as many more to be had as he wants he has only to ring the bell and call for them grant can get all that he wants both for himself and for thomas all the world is open to them while we are shut up in a bastile we are at sea and our boat has sprung a leak november 17th although sherman1 took atlanta he does not mean to stay there be it heaven or hell fire and the sword are for us here that is the word and now i must begin my columbia life anew and alone it will be a short shrift captain ogden came to dinner on sunday and in the afternoon asked me to go with him to the presbyterian church and hear mr palmer we went and i felt very youthful as the country people say like a girl and her beau ogden took me into a pew and my husband sat afar off what a sermon the preacher stirred my blood my very flesh crept and tingled a red hot glow of patriotism passed through me such a sermon must strengthen the hearts and the hands of many people there was more exhortation to fight and die à la joshua than meek christianity november 25th sherman is thundering at augusta's very doors my general was on the wing somber and full of care the girls are merry enough the staff who fairly live here no better cassandra with a black shawl over her head is chased by the gay crew from sofa to sofa for she avoids them being full of miserable anxiety there is nothing but distraction and confusion all things tend to the preparation for the departure of the troops it rains all the time such rains as i never saw before incessant torrents these men come in and out in the red mud and slush of columbia streets things seem dismal and wretched to me to the last degree but the staff the girls and the youngsters do not see it mrs s born in connecticut came and she was radiant she did not come to see me but my nieces she says exultingly that sherman will open a way out at last and i will go at once to europe or go north to my relatives there how she derided our misery and mocked when our fear cometh i dare say she takes me for a fool i sat there dumb although she was in my own house i have heard of a woman so enraged that she struck some one over the head with a shovel to day for the first time in my life i know how that mad woman felt i could have given mrs s the benefit of shovel and tongs both that splendid fellow preston hampton home they brought their warrior dead and wrapped in that very legion flag he had borne so often in battle with his own hands a letter from mrs davis to day under date of richmond va november 20 1864 she says affairs west are looking so critical now that before you receive this you and i will be in the depths or else triumphant i confess i do not sniff success in every passing breeze but i am so tired hoping fearing and being disappointed that i have made up my mind not to be disconsolate even though thieves break through and steal some people expect another attack upon richmond shortly but i think the avalanche will not slide until the spring breaks up its winter quarters i have a blind kind of prognostics of victory for us but somehow i am not cheered the temper of congress is less vicious but more concerted in its hostile action mrs davis is a woman that my heart aches for in the troubles ahead my journal a quire of confederate paper lies wide open on my desk in the corner of my drawing room everybody reads it who chooses buck comes regularly to see what i have written last and makes faces when it does not suit her isabella still calls me cassandra and puts her hands to her ears when i begin to wail well cassandra only records what she hears she does not vouch for it for really one nowadays never feels certain of anything november 28th we dined at mrs mccord's she is as strong a cordial for broken spirits and failing heart as one could wish how her strength contrasts with our weakness like doctor palmer she strings one up to bear bravely the worst she has the intellect of a man and the perseverance and endurance of a woman we have lost nearly all of our men and we have no money and it looks as if we had taught the yankees how to fight since manassas our best and bravest are under the sod we shall have to wait till another generation grows up here we stand despair in our hearts oh cassandra don't shouts isabella with our houses burning or about to be over our heads the north have just got things ship shape a splendid army perfectly disciplined with new levies coming in day and night their gentry do not go into the ranks they hardly know there is a war up there
december 2d bragg begs to be relieved of his command the army will be relieved to get rid of him he has a winning way of earning everybody's detestation heavens how they hate him the rapid flight of his army terminated at ringgold hardie declines even a temporary command of the western army preston johnston has been sent out post haste at a moment's warning he was not even allowed time to go home and tell his wife good by or as browne the englishman said to put a clean shirt into his traveling bag lee and meade are facing each other gallantly 1 the first of december we went with a party of mrs ould's getting up to see a french frigate which lay at anchor down the river the french officers came on board our boat the lees were aboard the french officers were not in the least attractive either in manners or appearance but our ladies were most attentive and some showered bad french upon them with a lavish hand always accompanied by queer grimaces to eke out the scanty supply of french words the sentences ending usually in a nervous shriek are they deaf asked mrs randolph the french frigate was a dirty little thing doctor garnett was so buoyed up with hope that the french were coming to our rescue that he would not let me say an english man of war is the cleanest thing known in the world captain said to mary lee with a foreign contortion of countenance that went for a smile i's bashlor judge ould said as we went to dinner on our own steamer they will not drink our president's health they do not acknowledge us to be a nation mind none of you say emperor not once doctor garnett interpreted the laws of politeness otherwise and stepped forward his mouth fairly distended with so much french and said vieff l'emperor young gibson seconded him quietly à la santé de l'empereur but silence prevailed preston hampton was the handsomest man on board the figure of hercules the face of apollo cried an enthusiastic girl preston was as lazy and as sleepy as ever he said of the frenchmen they can't help not being good looking but with all the world open to them to wear such shabby clothes the lieutenant's name was rousseau on the french frigate lying on one of the tables was a volume of jean jacques rousseau's works side by side strange to say with a map of south carolina this lieutenant was courteously asked by mary lee to select some lady to whom she might introduce him he answered i shuse you with a bow that was a benediction and a prayer and now i am in a fine condition for hetty cary's starvation party where they will give thirty dollars for the music and not a cent for a morsel to eat preston said contentedly i hate dancing and i hate cold water so i will eschew the festivity to night found john r thompson at our house when i got home so tired to night he brought me the last number of the cornhill he knew how much i was interested in trollope's story framley parsonage december 4th my husband bought yesterday at the commissary's one barrel of flour one bushel of potatoes one peck of rice five pounds of salt beef and one peck of salt all for sixty dollars in the street a barrel of flour sells for one hundred and fifteen dollars december 5th wigfall was here last night he began by wanting to hang jeff davis my husband managed him beautifully he soon ceased to talk virulent nonsense and calmed down to his usual strong common sense i knew it was as quite late but i had no idea of the hour my husband beckoned me out it is all your fault said he what why will you persist in looking so interested in all wigfall is saying don't let him catch your eye look into the fire did you not hear it strike two this attack was so sudden so violent so unlooked for i could only laugh hysterically however as an obedient wife i went back gravely took my seat and looked into the fire i did not even dare raise my eyes to see what my husband was doing if he too looked into the fire wigfall soon tired of so tame an audience and took his departure general lawton was here he was one of stonewall's generals so i listened with all my ears when he said stonewall could not sleep so every two or three nights you were waked up by orders to have your brigade in marching order before daylight and report in person to the commander then you were marched a few miles out and then a few miles in again all this was to make us ready ever on the alert and the end of it was this jackson's men would go half a day's march before peter longstreet waked and breakfasted i think there is a popular delusion about the amount of praying he did he certainly preferred a fight on sunday to a sermon failing to manage a fight he loved best a long presbyterian sermon calvinistic to the core he had shown small sympathy with human infirmity he was a one idea ed man he looked upon broken down men and stragglers as the same thing he classed all who were weak and weary who fainted by the wayside as men wanting in patriotism if a man's face was as white as cotton and his pulse so low you scarce could feel it he looked upon him merely as an inefficient soldier and rode off impatiently he was the true type of all great soldiers like the successful warriors of the world he did not value human life where he had an object to accomplish he could order men to their death as a matter of course his soldiers obeyed him to the death faith they had in him stronger than death their respect he commanded i doubt if he had so much of their love as is talked about while he was alive now that they see a few more years of stonewall would have freed them from the yankees they deify him any man is proud to have been one of the famous stonewall brigade but be sure it was bitter hard work to keep up with him as all know who ever served under him he gave his orders rapidly and distinctly and rode away never allowing answer or remonstrance it was look there see that place take it when you failed you were apt to be put under arrest when you reported the place taken he only said good spent seventy five dollars to day for a little tea and sugar and have five hundred left my husband's pay never has paid for the rent of our lodgings he came in with dreadful news just now i have wept so often for things that never happened i will withhold my tears now for a certainty to day a poor woman threw herself on her dead husband's coffin and kissed it she was weeping bitterly so did i in sympathy my husband as i told him to day could see me and everything that he loved hanged drawn and quartered without moving a muscle if a crowd were looking on he could have the same gentle operation performed on himself and make no sign to all of which violent insinuation he answered in unmoved tones so would any civilized man savages however indians at least are more dignified in that particular than we are noisy fidgety grief never moves me at all it annoys me self control is what we all need you are a miracle of sensibility self control is what you need so you are civilized i said some day i mean to be december 9th come here mrs chesnut said mary preston to day they are lifting general hood out of his carriage here at your door mrs grundy promptly had him borne into her drawing room which was on the first floor mary preston and i ran down and greeted him as cheerfully and as cordially as if nothing had happened since we saw him standing before us a year ago how he was waited upon some cut up oranges were brought him how kind people are said he not once since i was wounded have i ever been left without fruit hard as it is to get now the money value of friendship is easily counted now said some one oranges are five dollars apiece december 10th mrs davis and mrs lyons came we had luncheon brought in for them and then a lucid explanation of the chronique scandaleuse of which beck j is the heroine we walked home with mrs davis and met the president riding alone surely that is wrong it must be unsafe for him when there are so many traitors not to speak of bribed negroes burton harrison1 says mr davis prefers to go alone and there is none to gainsay him my husband laid the law down last night i felt it to be the last drop in my full cup no more feasting in this house said he this is no time for junketing and merrymaking and you said you brought me here to enjoy the winter before you took me home and turned my face to a dead wall he is the master of the house to hear is to obey december 14th drove out with mrs davis she had a watch in her hand which some poor dead soldier wanted to have sent to his family first we went to her mantua maker then we drove to the fair grounds where the band was playing suddenly she missed the watch she remembered having it when we came out of the mantua maker's we drove beck instantly and there the watch was lying near the steps of the little porch in front of the house no one had passed in apparently in any case no one had seen it preston hampton went with me to see conny cary the talk was frantically literary which preston thought hard on him i had just brought the st denis number of les miserables sunday christopher hampton walked to church with me coming out general lee was seen slowly making his way down the aisle bowing royally to right and left i pointed him out to christopher hampton when general lee happened to look our way he bowed low giving me a charming smile of recognition i was ashamed of being so pleased i blushed like a schoolgirl we went to the white house they gave us tea the president said he had been on the way to our house coming with all the davis family to see me but the children became so troublesome they turned back just then little joe rushed in and insisted on saying his prayers at his father's knee then and there he was in his night clothes december 19th a box has come from home for me taking advantage of this good fortune and a full larder have asked mrs davis to dine with me wade hampton sent me a basket of game we had mrs davis and mr and mrs preston after dinner we walked to the church to see the freeland lewis wedding mr preston had mrs davis on his arm my husband and mrs preston and burton harrison and myself brought up the rear willie allan joined us and we had the pleasure of waiting one good hour then the beautiful maria loveliest of brides sailed in on her father's arm and major john coxe lewis followed with mrs freeland after the ceremony such a kissing was there up and down the aisle the happy bridegroom kissed wildly and several girls complained but he said how am i to know maria's kin whom i was to kiss it is better to show too much affection for one's new relations than too little december 21st joe johnston has been made commander in chief of the army of the west general lee had this done tis said miss agnes lee and little robert as they fondly call general lee's youngest son in this hero worshiping community called they told us the president general lee and general elzey had gone out to look at the fortifications around richmond my husband came home saying he had been with them and lent general lee his gray horse mrs howell mrs davis's mother says a year ago on the cars a man said we want a dictator she replied jeff davis will never consent to be a dictator the man turned sharply toward her and pray who asks him joe johnston will be made dictator by the army of the west imperator was suggested of late the army of the west has not been in a condition to dictate to friend or foe certainly jeff davis did hate to put joe johnston at the head of what is left of it detached from general lee what a horrible failure is longstreet oh for a day of albert sidney johnston out west and stonewall could he come back to us here general hood the wounded knight came for me to drive i felt that i would soon find myself chaperoning some girls but i asked no questions he improved the time between franklin and cary streets by saying i do like your husband so much so do i i replied simply harrison and myself brought up the rear willie allan joined us and we had the pleasure of waiting one good hour then the beautiful maria loveliest of brides sailed in on her father's arm and major john coxe lewis followed with mrs freeland after the ceremony such a kissing was there up and down the aisle the happy bridegroom kissed wildly and several girls complained but he said

the wounded knight came for me to drive i felt that i would soon find myself chaperoning some girls but i asked no questions he improved the time between franklin and cary streets by saying i do like your husband so much so do i i replied simply buck was ill in bed so william said at the door but she recovered her health and came down for the drive in black velvet and ermine looking queenly and then with the top of the landau thrown back wrapped in furs and rugs we had a long drive that bitter cold day one day as we were hieing us home from the fair grounds sam the wounded knight asked brewster what are the symptoms of a man's being in love sam hood is called sam entirely but why i do not know said for his part he did not know at seventeen he had fancied himself in love but that was a long time ago brewster spoke on the symptoms of love when you see her your breath is apt to come short if it amounts to mild strangulation you have got it bad you are stupidly jealous glowering with jealousy and have a gloomy fixed conviction that she likes every fool you meet better than she does you especially people that you know she has a thorough contempt for that is you knew it before you lost your head i mean before you fell in love the last stages of unmitigated spooniness i will spare you said brewster with a giggle and a wave of the hand well said sam drawing a breath of relief i have felt none of these things so far and yet they say i am engaged to four young ladies a liberal allowance you will admit for a man who can not walk without help another day the sabbath we called on our way from church to see mrs wigfall she was ill but mr wigfall insisted upon taking me into the drawing room to rest a while he said louly was there so she was and so was sam hood the wounded knight stretched at full length on a sofa and a rug thrown over him louis wigfall said to me do you know general hood yes said i and the general laughed with his eyes as i looked at him but he did not say a word i felt it a curious commentary upon the reports he had spoken of the day before louly wigfall is a very handsome girl december 24th as we walked brewster reported a row he had had with general hood brewster had told those six young ladies at the prestons that old sam was in the habit of saying he would not marry if he could any silly sentimental girl who would throw herself away upon a maimed creature such as he was when brewster went home he took pleasure in telling sam how the ladies had complimented his good sense whereupon the general rose in his wrath and threatened to break his crutch over brewster's head to think he could be such a fool to go about repeating to everybody his whimperings i was taking my seat at the head of the table when the door opened and brewster walked in unannounced he took his stand in front of the open door with his hands in his pockets and his small hat pushed back as far as it could get from his forehead what said he you are not ready yet the generals are below did you get my note i begged my husband to excuse me and rushed off to put on my bonnet and furs i met the girls coming up with a strange man the flurry of two major generals had been too much for me and i forgot to ask the new one's name they went up to dine in my place with my husband who sat eating his dinner with lawrence's undivided attention given to him amid this whirling and eddying in and out of the world militant mary preston and i then went to drive with the generals the new one proved to be bruckner 1 who is also a kentuckian the two men told us they had slept together the night before chickamauga it is useless to try legs can't any longer be kept out of the conversation so general buckner said once before i slept with a man and he lost his leg next day he had made a vow never to do so again when sam and i parted that morning we said you or i may be killed but the cause will be safe all the same after the drive everybody came in to tea my husband in famous good humor we had an unusually gay evening it was very nice of my husband to take no notice of my conduct at dinner which had been open to criticism all the comfort of my life depends upon his being in good humor christmas day 1863 yesterday dined with the prestons wore one of my handsomest paris dresses from paris before the war three magnificent kentucky generals were present with senator orr from south carolina and mr miles general buckner repeated a speech of hood's to him to show how friendly they were i prefer a ride with you to the company of any woman in the world buckner had answered i prefer your company to that of any man certainly was hood's reply this became the standing joke of the dinner it flashed up in every form poor sam got out of it so badly if he got out of it at all general buckner said patronizingly lame excuses all hood never gets out of any scrape that is unless he can fight out others dropped in after dinner some without arms some without legs von borcke who can not speak because of a wound in his throat isabella said we have all kinds now but a blind one poor fellows they laugh at wounds and they yet can show many a scar we had for dinner oyster soup besides roast mutton ham boned turkey wild duck partridge plum pudding sauterne burgundy sherry and madeira there is life in the old land yet at my house to day after dinner and while alex haskell and my husband sat over the wine hood gave me an account of his discomfiture last night he said he could not sleep after it it was the hardest battle he had ever fought in his life and i was routed as it were she told me there was no hope that ends it you know at petersburg on my way to the western army she half promised me to think of it she would not say yes but she did not say no that is not exactly at any rate i went off saying i am engaged to you and she said i am not engaged to you after i was so fearfully wounded i gave it up but then since i came etc do you mean to say said i that you had proposed to her before that conversation in the carriage when you asked brewster the symptoms of love i like your audacity oh she understood but it is all up now for she says no my husband says i am extravagant no my friend not that said i i had fifteen hundred dollars and i have spent every cent of it in my housekeeping not one cent for myself not one cent for dress nor any personal want whatever he calls me hospitality run mad
december 1st at coosawhatchie yankees are landing in great force our troops down there are raw militia old men and boys never under fire before some college cadets in all a mere handful the cradle and the grave have been robbed by us they say sherman goes to savannah and not to augusta december 2d isabella and i put on bonnets and shawls and went deliberately out for news we determined to seek until we found met a man who was so ugly i could not forget him or his sobriquet he was awfully in love with me once he did not know me but blushed hotly when isabella told him who i was he had forgotten me i hope or else i am changed by age and care past all recognition he gave us the encouraging information that grahamville had been burned to the ground when the call for horses was made mrs mccord sent in her fine bays she comes now with a pair of mules and looks too long and significantly at my ponies if i were not so much afraid of her i would hint that those mules would be of far more use in camp than my ponies but they will seize the ponies no doubt in all my life before the stables were far off from the house and i had nothing to do with them now my ponies are kept under an open shed next to the back piazza here i sit with my work or my desk or my book basking in our southern sun and i watch nat feed curry and rub down the horses and then he cleans their stables as thoroughly as smith does my drawing room i see their beds of straw comfortably laid nat says ow missis ain't lady's business to look so much in de stables i care nothing for his grumbling and i have never had horses in better condition poor ponies you deserve every attention and enough to eat grass does not grow under your feet by night and day you are on the trot to day general chesnut was in charleston on his way from augusta to savannah by rail the telegraph is still working between charleston and savannah grahamville certainly is burned there was fighting down there to day i came home with enough to think about heaven knows and then all day long we compounded a pound cake in honor of mrs cuthbert who has things so nice at home the cake was a success but was it worth all that trouble as my party were driving off to the concert an omnibus rattled up enter captain leland of general chesnut's staff of as imposing a presence as a field marshal handsome and gray haired he was here on some military errand and brought me a letter he said the yankees had been repulsed and that down in those swamps we could give a good account of ourselves if our government would send men enough with a sufficient army to meet them down there they could be annihilated where are the men to come from asked mamie wildly general hood has gone off to tennessee even if he does defeat thomas there what difference would that make here december 3d we drank tea at mrs mccord's she had her troubles too the night before a country cousin claimed her hospitality one who fain would take the train at five this morning a little after midnight mrs mccord was startled out of her first sleep by loud ringing of bells an alarm at night may mean so much just now in an instant she was on her feet she found her guest who thought it was daylight and wanted to go mrs mccord forcibly demonstrated how foolish it was to get up five hours too soon mrs mccord once more in her own warm bed had fallen happily to sleep she was waked by feeling two ice cold hands pass cautiously over her face and person it was pitch dark even mrs mccord gave a scream in her fright she found it was only the irrepressible guest up and at her again so though it was only three o'clock in order to quiet this perturbed spirit she rose and at five drove her to the station where she had to wait some hours but mrs mccord said anything for peace at home the restless people who will not let others rest december 5th miss olivia middleton and mr frederick blake are to be married we confederates have invented the sit up all night for the wedding night isabella calls it the wake not the wedding of the parties married the ceremony will be performed early in the evening the whole company will then sit up until five o'clock at which hour the bridal couple take the train for combahee hope sherman will not be so inconsiderate as to cut short the honeymoon in tripped brewster with his hat on his head both hands extended and his greeting well here we are he was travel stained disheveled grimy with dirt the prophet would have to send him many times to bathe in jordan before he could be pronounced clean hood will not turn and pursue sherman thomas is at his heels with forty thousand men and can have as many more as he wants for the asking between thomas and sherman hood would be crushed so he was pushing i do not remember where or what i know there was no comfort in anything he said serena's account of money spent paper and envelopes 12.00 tickets to concert 10.00 tooth brush 10.00 total 32.00 december 14th and now the young ones are in bed and i am wide awake it is an odd thing in all my life how many persons have i seen in love not a half dozen and i am a tolerably close observer a faithful watcher have i been from my youth upward of men and manners society has been for me only an enlarged field for character study flirtation is the business of society that is playing at love making it begins in vanity it ends in vanity it is spurred on by idleness and a want of any other excitement flattery battledore and shuttlecock how in this game flattery is dashed backward and forward it is so soothing to self conceit if it begins and ends in vanity vexation of spirit supervenes sometimes they do occasionally burn their fingers awfully playing with fire but there are no hearts broken each party in a flirtation has secured a sympathetic listener to whom he or she can talk of himself or herself somebody who for the time admires one exclusively and as the french say excessivement it is a pleasant but very foolish game and so to bed hood and thomas have had a fearful fight with carnage and loss of generals excessive in proportion to numbers that means they were leading and urging their men up to the enemy i know how bartow and barnard bee were killed bringing up their men one of mr chesnut's sins thrown in his teeth by the legislature of south carolina was that he procured the promotion of gist state rights gist by his influence in richmond what have these comfortable stay at home patriots to say of general gist now and how could man die better than facing fearful odds etc so fort mcalister has fallen good by savannah our governor announces himself a follower of joe brown of georgia another famous joe december 19th the deep waters are closing over us and we are in this house like the outsiders at the time of the flood we care for none of these things we eat drink laugh dance in lightness of heart doctor trezevant came to tell me the dismal news how he piled on the agony desolation mismanagement despair general young with the flower of hampton's cavalry is in columbia horses can not be found to mount them neither the governor of georgia nor the governor of south carolina is moving hand or foot they have given up the yankees claim another victory for thomas 1 hope it may prove like most of their victories brag and bluster can't say why maybe i am benumbed but i do not feel so intensely miserable december 27th oh why did we go to camden the very dismalest christmas overtook us there miss rhett went with us a brilliant woman and very agreeable the world you know is composed said she of men women and rhetts see lady montagu now we feel that if we are to lose our negroes we would as soon see sherman free them as the confederate government freeing negroes is the last confederate government craze we are a little too slow about it that is all sold fifteen bales of cotton and took a sad farewell look at mulberry it is a magnificent old country seat with old oaks green lawns and all so i took that last farewell of mulberry once so hated now so beloved
february 20 1862 had an appetite for my dainty breakfast always breakfast in bed now but then my mercury contained such bad news that is an appetizing style of matutinal newspaper fort donelson1 has fallen but no men fell with it it is prisoners for them that we can not spare or prisoners for us that we may not be able to feed that is so much to be forefended as keitt says they lost six thousand we two thousand i grudge that proportion in vain alas ye gallant few few but undismayed again they make a stand we have buckner beauregard and albert sidney johnston with such leaders and god's help we may be saved from the hated yankees who knows february 21st a crowd collected here last night and there was a serenade i am like mrs nickleby who never saw a horse coming full speed but she thought the cheerybles had sent post haste to take nicholas into co partnership so i got up and dressed late as it was i felt sure england had sought our alliance at last and we would make a yorktown of it before long who was it will you ever guess artemus goodwyn and general owens of florida just then mr chesnut rushed in put out the light locked the door and sat still as a mouse rap rap came at the door i say chesnut they are calling for you at last we heard janney hotel keeper loudly proclaiming from the piazza that colonel chesnut was not here at all at all after a while when they had all gone from the street and the very house itself had subsided into perfect quiet the door again was roughly shaken i say chesnut old fellow come out i know you are there nobody here now wants to hear you make a speech that crowd has all gone we want a little quiet talk with you i am just from richmond that was the open sesame and to day i hear none of the richmond news is encouraging colonel shaw is blamed for the shameful roanoke surrender 1 toombs is out on a rampage and swears he will not accept a seat in the confederate senate given in the insulting way his was by the georgia legislature calls it shabby treatment and adds that georgia is not the only place where good men have been so ill used the governor and council have fluttered the dove cotes or at least the tea tables they talk of making a call for all silver etc i doubt if we have enough to make the sacrifice worth while but we propose to set the example february 22d what a beautiful day for our confederate president to be inaugurated god speed him god keep him god save him john chesnut's letter was quite what we needed in spirit it is all that one could ask he says our late reverses are acting finely with the army of the potomac a few more thrashings and every man will enlist for the war victories made us too sanguine and easy not to say vainglorious now for the rub and let them have it a lady wrote to mrs bunch dear emma when shall i call for you to go and see madame de st andré she was answered dear lou i can not go with you to see madame de st andre but will always retain the kindest feeling toward you on account of our past relations etc the astounded friend wrote to ask what all this meant no answer came and then she sent her husband to ask and demand an explanation he was answered thus my dear fellow there can be no explanation possible hereafter there will be no intercourse between my wife and yours simply that nothing more so the men meet at the club as before and there is no further trouble between them the lady upon whom the slur is cast says and i am a woman and can't fight february 23d while mr chesnut was in town i was at the prestons john cochran and some other prisoners had asked to walk over the grounds visit the hampton gardens and some friends in columbia after the dreadful state of the public mind at the escape of one of the prisoners general preston was obliged to refuse his request mrs preston and the rest of us wanted him to say yes and so find out who in columbia were his treacherous friends pretty bold people they must be to receive yankee invaders in the midst of the row over one enemy already turned loose amid us general preston said we are about to sacrifice life and fortune for a fickle multitude who will not stand up to us at last the harsh comments made as to his lenient conduct to prisoners have embittered him i told him what i had heard captain trenholm say in his speech he said he would listen to no criticism except from a man with a musket on his shoulder and who had beside enlisted for the war had given up all and had no choice but to succeed or die february 24th congress and the newspapers render one desperate ready to cut one's own throat they represent everything in our country as deplorable then comes some one back from our gay and gallant army at the front the spirit of our army keeps us up after all letters from the army revive one they come as welcome as the flowers in may hopeful and bright utterly unconscious of our weak despondency february 25th they have taken at nashville1 more men than we had at manassas there was bad handling of troops we poor women think or this would not be mr venable added bitterly giving up our soldiers to the enemy means giving up the cause we can not replace them the up country men were union men generally and the low country seceders the former growl they never liked those aristocratic boroughs and parishes they had themselves a good and prosperous country a good constitution and were satisfied but they had to go to leave all and fight for the others who brought on all the trouble and who do not show too much disposition to fight for themselves that is the extreme up country view the extreme low country says jeff davis is not enough out of the union yet his inaugural address reads as one of his speeches did four years ago in the united states senate a letter in a morning paper accused mr chesnut of staying too long in charleston the editor was asked for the writer's name he gave it as little moses the governor's secretary when little moses was spoken to in a great trepidation he said that mrs pickens wrote it and got him to publish it so it was dropped for little moses is such an arrant liar no one can believe him besides if that sort of thing amuses mrs pickens let her amuse herself
february 1st mrs davis gave her luncheon to ladies only on saturday many more persons there than at any of these luncheons which we have gone to before gumbo ducks and olives chickens in jelly oysters lettuce salad chocolate cream jelly cake claret champagne etc were the good things set before us to day for a pair of forlorn shoes i have paid 85 colonel ives drew my husband's pay for me i sent lawrence for it mr chesnut ordered him back to us we needed a man servant here colonel ives wrote that he was amazed i should be willing to trust a darky with that great bundle of money but it came safely mr petigru says you take your money to market in the market basket and bring home what you buy in your pocket book february 5th when lawrence handed me my husband's money six hundred dollars it was i said now i am pretty sure you do not mean to go to the yankees for with that pile of money in your hands you must have known there was your chance he grinned but said nothing at the president's reception hood had a perfect ovation general preston navigated him through the crowd handling him as tenderly on his crutches as if he were the princess of wales's new born baby that i read of to day it is bad for the head of an army to be so helpless but old blücher went to waterloo in a carriage wearing a bonnet on his head to shade his inflamed eyes a heroic figure truly an old red eyed bonneted woman apparently back in a landau and yet blücher to the rescue afterward at the prestons for we left the president's at an early hour major von borcke was trying to teach them his way of pronouncing his own name and reciting numerous travesties of it in this country when charles threw open the door saying a gentleman has called for major bandbox the prussian major acknowledged this to be the worst he had heard yet off to the ives's theatricals i walked with general breckinridge mrs clay's mrs malaprop was beyond our wildest hopes and she was in such bitter earnest when she pinched conny cary's lydia languish's shoulder and called her an antricate little huzzy that lydia showed she felt it and next day the shoulder was black and blue it was not that the actress had a grudge against conny but that she was intense even the back of mrs clay's head was eloquent as she walked away but said general breckinridge watch hood he has not seen the play before and bob acres amazes him when he caught my eye general hood nodded to me and said i believe that fellow acres is a coward that's better than the play whispered breckinridge but it is all good from sir anthony down to fag between the acts mrs clay sent us word to applaud she wanted encouragement the audience was too cold general breckinridge responded like a man after that she was fired by thunders of applause following his lead those mighty kentuckians turned claqueurs were a host in themselves constance cary not only acted well but looked perfectly beautiful during the farce mrs clay came in with all her feathers diamonds and fallals and took her seat by me said general breckinridge what a splendid head of hair you have and all my own said she afterward she said they could not get false hair enough so they put a pair of black satin boots on top of her head and piled hair over them we adjourned from mrs ives's to mrs ould's where we had the usual excellent richmond supper we did not get home until three it was a clear moonlight night almost as light as day as we walked along i said to general breckinridge you have spent a jolly evening i do not know he answered i have asked myself more than once to night are you the same man who stood gazing down on the faces of the dead on that awful battle field the soldiers lying there stare at you with their eyes wide open is this the same world here and there last night the great kentucky contingent came in a body hood brought buck in his carriage she said she did not like general hood and spoke with a wild excitement in those soft blue eyes of hers or are they gray or brown she then gave her reasons in the lowest voice but loud and distinct enough for him to hear why he spoke so harshly to cy his body servant as we got out of the carriage i saw how he hurt cy's feelings and i tried to soothe cy's mortification you see cy nearly caused me to fall by his awkwardness and i stormed at him said the general vastly amused i hate a man who speaks roughly to those who dare not resent it said she the general did own himself charmed with her sentiments but seemed to think his wrong doing all a good joke he and cy understand each other february 9th this party for johnny was the very nicest i have ever had and i mean it to be my last i sent word to the carys to bring their own men they came alone saying they did not care for men that means a raid on ours growled isabella mr lamar was devoted to constance cary he is a free lance so that created no heart burning afterward when the whole thing was over and a success the lights put out etc here trooped in the four girls who stayed all night with me in dressing gowns they stirred up a hot fire relit the gas and went in for their supper réchauffé was the word oysters hot coffee etc they kept it up till daylight of course we slept very late as they came in to breakfast i remarked the church bells have been going on like mad i take it as a rebuke to our breaking the sabbath you know sunday began at twelve o'clock last night it sounds to me like fire bells somebody said soon the infant dashed in done up in soldier's clothes the yankees are upon us said he don't you hear the alarm bells they have been ringing day and night alex haskell came he and johnny went off to report to custis lee and to be enrolled among his locals who are always detailed for the defense of the city but this time the attack on richmond has proved a false alarm a new trouble at the president's house their trusty man robert broken out with the smallpox we went to the webb ball and such a pleasant time we had after a while the p m g pet major general took his seat in the comfortable chair next to mine and declared his determination to hold that position mr hunter and mr benjamin essayed to dislodge him mrs stanard said take him in the flirtation room there he will soon be captured and led away but i did not know where that room was situated besides my bold texan made a most unexpected sally i will not go and i will prevent her from going with any of you supper was near at hand and mr mallory said ask him if the varioloid is not at his house i know it is i started as if i were shot and i took mr clay's arm and went in to supper leaving the p m g to the girls venison and everything nice february 12th john chesnut had a basket of champagne carried to my house oysters partridges and other good things for a supper after the reception he is going back to the army to morrow james chesnut arrived on wednesday he has been giving buck his opinion of one of her performances last night she was here and the general's carriage drove up bringing some of our girls they told her he could not come up and he begged she would go down there for a moment she flew down and stood ten minutes in that snow cy holding the carriage door open but colonel chesnut there was no harm i was not there ten minutes i could not get in the carriage because i did not mean to stay one minute he did not hold my hands that is not half the time oh you saw well he did kiss my hands where is the harm of that all men worship buck how can they help it she is so lovely lawrence has gone back ignominiously to south carolina at breakfast already in some inscrutable way he had become intoxicated he was told to move a chair and he raised it high over his head smashing mrs grundy's chandelier my husband said mary do tell lawrence to go home i am too angry to speak to him so lawrence went without another word he will soon be back and when he comes will say shoo i knew mars jeems could not do without me and indeed he can not buck reading my journal opened her beautiful eyes in amazement and said so little do people know themselves see what you say of me i replied the girls heard him say to you oh you are so childish and so sweet now buck you know you are not childish you have an abundance of strong common sense don't let men adore you so if you can help it you are so unhappy about men who care for you when they are killed isabella says that war leads to love making she says these soldiers do more courting here in a day than they would do at home without a war in ten years in the pauses of conversation we hear she is the noblest woman god ever made goodness exclaims isabella which one the amount of courting we hear in these small rooms men have to go to the front and they say their say desperately i am beginning to know all about it the girls tell me and i overhear i can not help it but this style is unique is it not since i saw you last year standing by the turnpike gate you know my battle cry has been god my country and you so many are lame major venable says it is not the devil on two sticks now the farce is cupid on crutches general breckinridge's voice broke in they are my cousins so i determined to kiss them good by good by nowadays is the very devil it means forever in all probability you know all the odds against us so i advanced to the charge soberly discreetly and in the fear of the lord the girls stood in a row four of the very prettiest i ever saw sam with his eyes glued to the floor cried you were afraid you backed out but i did nothing of the kind i kissed every one of them honestly heartily february 13th my husband is writing out some resolutions for the congress he is very busy too trying to get some poor fellows reprieved he says they are good soldiers but got into a scrape buck came in she had on her last winter's english hat with the pheasant's wing just then hood entered most unexpectedly said the blunt soldier to the girl you look mighty pretty in that hat you wore it at the turnpike gate where i surrendered at first sight she nodded and smiled and flew down the steps after mr chesnut looking back to say that she meant to walk with him as far as the executive office the general walked to the window and watched until the flutter of her garment was gone he said the president was finding fault with some of his officers in command and i said mr president why don't you come and lead us yourself i would follow you to the death actually if you stay here in richmond much longer you will grow to be a courtier and you came a rough texan mrs davis and general mcqueen came he tells me muscoe garnett is dead then the best and the cleverest virginian i know is gone he was the most scholarly man they had and his character was higher than his requirements to day a terrible onslaught was made upon the president for nepotism burton harrison's and john taylor wood's letters denying the charge that the president's cotton was unburned or that he left it to be bought by the yankees have enraged the opposition how much these people in the president's family have to bear i have never felt so indignant february 16th saw in mrs howell's room the little negro mrs davis rescued yesterday from his brutal negro guardian the child is an orphan he was dressed up in little joe's clothes and happy as a lord he was very anxious to show me his wounds and bruises but i fled there are some things in life too sickening and cruelty is one of them somebody said people who knew general hood before the war said there was nothing in him as for losing his property by the war some say he never had any and that west point is a pauper's school after all he has only military glory and that he has gained since the war began now said burton harrison only military glory i like that the glory and the fame he has gained during the war that is hood what was napoleon before toulon hood has the impassive dignity of an indian chief he has always a little court around him of devoted friends wigfall himself has said he could not get within hood's lines february 17th found everything in main street twenty per cent dearer they say it is due to the new currency bill i asked my husband is general johnston ordered to reenforce polk they said he did not understand the order after five days delay he replied they say sherman is marching to mobile 1 when they once get inside of our armies what is to molest them unless it be women with broomsticks general johnston writes that the governor of georgia refuses him provisions and the use of his roads the governor of georgia writes the roads are open to him and in capital condition i have furnished him abundantly with provisions from time to time as he desired them i suppose both of these letters are placed away side by side in our archives february 20th mrs preston was offended by the story of buck's performance at the ive's general breckinridge told her it was the most beautifully unconscious act he ever saw the general was leaning against the wall buck standing guard by him on her two feet the crowd surged that way and she held out her arm to protect him from the rush after they had all passed she handed him his crutches and they too moved slowly away mrs davis said any woman in richmond would have done the same joyfully but few could do it so gracefully buck is made so conspicuous by her beauty whatever she does can not fail to attract attention johnny stayed at home only one day then went to his plantation got several thousand confederate dollars and in the afternoon drove out with mrs k at the bee store he spent a thousand of his money bought us gloves and linen well one can do without gloves but linen is next to life itself yesterday the president walked home from church with me he said he was so glad to see my husband at church had never seen him there before remarked on how well he ooked etc i replied that he looked so well because you have never before seen him in the part of the right man in the right place my husband has no fancy for being planted in pews but he is utterly christian in his creed february 23d at the president's where general lee breakfasted a man named phelan told general lee all he ought to do planned a campaign for him general lee smiled blandly the while though he did permit himself a mild sneer at the wise civilians in congress who refrained from trying the battle field in person but from afar dictated the movements of armies my husband said that to his amazement general lee came into his room at the executive office to pay his respects and have a talk dear me goodness gracious said i that was a compliment from the head of the army the very first man in the world we confederates think february 24th friends came to make taffy and stayed the livelong day they played cards one man a soldier had only two teeth left in front and they lapped across each other on account of the condition of his mouth he had maintained a dignified sobriety of aspect though he told some funny stories finally a story was too much for him and he grinned from ear to ear maggie gazed and then called out as the negro fiddlers call out dancing figures forward two and cross over fancy our faces the hero of the two teeth relapsing into a decorous arrangement of mouth said cavalry are the eyes of an army they bring the news the artillery are the boys to make a noise but the infantry do the fighting and a general or so gets all the glory february 26th we went to see mrs breckinridge who is here with her husband then we paid our respects to mrs lee her room was like an industrial school everybody so busy her daughters were all there plying their needles with several other ladies mrs lee showed us a beautiful sword recently sent to the general by some marylanders now in paris on the blade was engraved aide toi et dieu t'aidera when we came out someone said did you see how the lees spend their time what a rebuke to the taffy parties another maimed hero is engaged to be married sally hampton has accepted john haskell there is a story that he reported for duty after his arm was shot off suppose in the fury of the battle he did not feel the pain general breckinridge once asked what's the name of the fellow who has gone to europe for hood's leg dr darby suppose it is shipwrecked no matter half a dozen are ordered mrs preston raised her hands no wonder the general says they talk of him as if he were a centipede his leg is in everybody's mouth
lincolnton n.c february 16 1865 a change has come o'er the spirit of my dream dear old quire of yellow coarse confederate home made paper here you are again an age of anxiety and suffering has passed over my head since last i wrote and wept over your forlorn pages my ideas of those last days are confused the martins left columbia the friday before i did and mammy the negro woman who had nursed them refused to go with them that daunted me then mrs mccord who was to send her girls with me changed her mind she sent them up stairs in her house and actually took away the staircase that was her plan then i met mr christopher hampton arranging to take off his sisters they were flitting but were to go only as far as yorkville he said it was time to move on sherman was at orangeburg barely a day's journey from columbia and had left a track as bare and blackened as a fire leaves on the prairies so my time had come too my husband urged me to go home he said camden would be safe enough they had no spite against that old town as they have against charleston and columbia molly weeping and wailing came in while we were at table wiping her red hot face with the cook's grimy apron she said i ought to go among our own black people on the plantation they would take care of me better than any one else so i agreed to go to mulberry or the hermitage plantation and sent lawrence down with a wagon load of my valuables then a miss patterson called a refugee from tennessee she had been in a country overrun by yankee invaders and she described so graphically all the horrors to be endured by those subjected to fire and sword rapine and plunder that i was fairly scared and determined to come here this is a thoroughly out of all routes place and yet i can go to charlotte am half way to kate at flat rock and there is no federal army between me and richmond as soon as my mind was finally made up we telegraphed to lawrence who had barely got to camden in the wagon when the telegram was handed to him so he took the train and came back mr chesnut sent him with us to take care of the party we thought that if the negroes were ever so loyal to us they could not protect me from an army bent upon sweeping us from the face of the earth and if they tried to do so so much the worse would it be for the poor things with their yankee friends i then left them to shift for themselves as they are accustomed to do and i took the same liberty my husband does not care a fig for the property question and never did perhaps if he had ever known poverty it would be different he talked beautifully about it as he always does about everything i have told him often that if at heaven's gate st peter would listen to him a while and let him tell his own story he would get in and the angels might give him a crown extra now he says he has only one care that i should be safe and not so harassed with dread and then there is his blind old father a man said he can always die like a patriot and a gentleman with no fuss and take it coolly it is hard not to envy those who are out of all this their difficulties ended those who have met death gloriously on the battle field their doubts all solved one can but do his best and leave the result to a higher power after new orleans those vain passionate impatient little creoles were forever committing suicide driven to it by despair and beast butler as we read these things mrs davis said if they want to die why not first kill beast butler rid the world of their foe and be saved the trouble of murdering themselves that practical way of removing their intolerable burden did not occur to them i repeated this suggestive anecdote to our corps of generals without troops here in this house as they spread out their maps on my table where lay this quire of paper from which i write every man jack of them had a safe plan to stop sherman if even beauregard and lee were expected but grant had double teamed on lee lee could not save his own how could he come to save us read the list of the dead in those last battles around richmond and petersburg1 if you want to break your heart i took french leave of columbia slipped away without a word to anybody isaac hayne and mr chesnut came down to the charlotte depot with me ellen my maid left her husband and only child but she was willing to come and indeed was very cheerful in her way of looking at it i wan travel roun wid missis some time stid uh molly goin all de time a woman fifty years old at least and uglier than she was old sharply rebuked my husband for standing at the car window for a last few words with me she said rudely stand aside sir i want air with his hat off and his grand air my husband bowed politely and said in one moment madam i have something important to say to my wife claiming his protection she had never traveled alone before in all her life old age and ugliness are protective in some cases she was ardently patriotic for a while then she was joined by her friend a man as crazy as herself to get out of this from their talk i gleaned she had been for years in the treasury department they were about to cross the lines the whole idea was to get away from the trouble to come down here they were yankees but were they not spies here i am broken hearted and an exile and in such a place we have bare floors and for a feather bed pine table and two chairs i pay 30 a day such sheets but fortunately i have some of my own at the door before i was well out of the hack the woman of the house packed lawrence back neck and heels she would not have him at any price she treated him as mr f s aunt did clenman in little dorrit she said his clothes were too fine for a nigger his airs indeed poor lawrence was humble and silent he said at last miss mary send me back to mars jeems i began to look for a pencil to write a note to my husband but in the flurry could not find one here is one said lawrence producing one with a gold case go away she shouted i want no niggers here with gold pencils and airs so lawrence fled before the storm but not before he had begged me to go back he said if mars jeems knew how you was treated he'd never be willing for you to stay here the martins had seen my to them well known traveling case as the hack trotted up main street and they arrived at this juncture out of breath we embraced and wept i kept my room the fants are refugees here too they are virginians and have been in exile since the second battle of manassas poor things they seem to have been everywhere and seen and suffered everything they even tried to go back to their own house but found one chimney only standing alone even that had been taken possession of by a yankee who had written his name upon it the day i left home i had packed a box of flour sugar rice and coffee but my husband would not let me bring it he said i was coming to a land of plenty unexplored north carolina where the foot of the yankee marauder was unknown and in columbia they would need food now i have written for that box and many other things to be sent me by lawrence or i shall starve the middletons have come how joyously i sprang to my feet to greet them mrs ben rutledge described the hubbub in columbia everybody was flying in every direction like a flock of swallows she heard the enemy's guns booming in the distance the train no longer run from charlotte to columbia miss middleton possesses her soul in peace she is as cool clever rational and entertaining as ever and we talked for hours mrs reed was in a state of despair i can well understand that sinking of mind and body during the first days as the abject misery of it all closes in upon you i remember my suicidal tendencies when i first came here february 18th here i am thank god settled at the mclean's in a clean comfortable room airy and cozy with a grateful heart i stir up my own bright wood fire my bill for four days at this splendid hotel here was 240 with 25 additional for fire but once more my lines have fallen in pleasant places as we came up on the train from charlotte a soldier took out of his pocket a filthy rag if it had lain in the gutter for months it could not have looked worse he unwrapped the thing carefully and took out two biscuits of the species known as hard tack then he gallantly handed me one and with an ingratiating smile asked me to take some then he explained saying please take these two swap with me give me something softer that i can eat i am very weak still immediately for his benefit my basket of luncheon was emptied but as for his biscuit i would not choose any isabella asked but what did you say to him when he poked them under your nose and i replied i held up both hands saying i would not take from you anything that is yours far from it i would not touch them for worlds a tremendous day's work and i helped with a will our window glass was all to be washed then the brass andirons were to be polished after we rubbed them bright how pretty they were presently ellen would have none of me she was scrubbing the floor you go dat's a good missis an stay to miss isabella's till de flo dry i am very docile now and i obeyed orders february 19th the fants say all the trouble at the hotel came from our servants bragging they represented us as millionaires and the middleton men servants smoked cigars mrs reed's averred that he had never done anything in his life but stand behind his master at table with a silver waiter in his hand we were charged accordingly but perhaps the landlady did not get the best of us after all for we paid her in confederate money now that they won't take confederate money in the shops here how are we to live miss middleton says quartermasters families are all clad in good gray cloth but the soldiers go naked well we are like the families of whom the novels always say they are poor but honest poor well nigh beggars are we for i do not know where my next meal is to come from called on mrs ben rutledge to day she is lovely exquisitely refined her mother mrs middleton came in you are not looking well dear anything the matter no but mamma i have not eaten a mouthful to day the children can eat mush i can't i drank my tea however she does not understand taking favors and blushing violently refused to let me have ellen make her some biscuit i went home and sent her some biscuit all the same february 22d isabella has been reading my diaries how we laugh because my sage divinations all come to naught my famous insight into character is utter folly the diaries were lying on the hearth ready to be burned but she told me to hold on to them think of them a while and don't be rash afterward when isabella and i were taking a walk general joseph e johnston joined us he explained to us all of lee's and stonewall jackson's mistakes we had nothing to say how could we say anything he said he was very angry when he was ordered to take command again he might well have been in a genuine rage this on and off procedure would be enough to bewilder the coolest head mrs johnston knows how to be a partizan of joe johnston and still not make his enemies uncomfortable she can be pleasant and agreeable as she was to my face a letter from my husband who is at charlotte he came near being taken a prisoner in columbia for he was asleep the morning of the 17th when the yankees blew up the railroad depot that woke him of course and he found everybody had left columbia and the town was surrendered by the mayor colonel goodwyn hampton and his command had been gone several hours isaac hayne came away with general chesnut there was no fire in the town when they left they overtook hampton's command at meek's mill that night from the hills where they encamped they saw the fire and knew the yankees were burning the town as we had every reason to expect they would molly was left in charge of everything of mine including mrs preston's cow which i was keeping and sally goodwyn's furniture charleston and wilmington have surrendered i have no further use for a newspaper i never want to see another one as long as i live wade hampton has been made a lieutenant general too late if he had been made one and given command in south carolina six months ago i believe he would have saved us shame disgrace beggary all have come at once and are hard to bear the grand smash rain rain outside and naught but drowning floods of tears inside i could not bear it so i rushed down in that rainstorm to the martins rev mr martin met me at the door madam said he columbia is burned to the ground i bowed my head and sobbed aloud stop that he said trying to speak cheerfully come here wife said he to mrs martin this woman cries with her whole heart just as she laughs but in spite of his words his voice broke down and he was hardly calmer than myself february 23d i want to get to kate i am so utterly heart broken i hope john chesnut and general chesnut may at least get into the same army we seem scattered over the face of the earth isabella sits there calmly reading i have quieted down after the day's rampage may our heavenly father look down on us and have pity they say i was the last refugee from columbia who was allowed to enter by the door of the cars the government took possession then and women could only be smuggled in by the windows stout ones stuck and had to be pushed pulled and hauled in by main force dear mrs izard with all her dignity was subjected to this rough treatment she was found almost too much for the size of the car windows february 25th the pfeifers who live opposite us here are descendants of those pfeifers who came south with mr chesnut's ancestors after the fort duquesne disaster they have now therefore been driven out of their eden the valley of virginia a second time the present pfeifer is the great man the rich man par excellence of lincolnton they say that with something very near to tears in his eyes he heard of our latest defeats it is only a question of time with us now he said the raiders will come you know in washington before i knew any of them except by sight mrs davis mrs emory and mrs johnston were always together inseparable friends and the trio were pointed out to me as the cleverest women in the united states now that i do know them all well i think the world was right in its estimate of them met a mr ancrum of serenely cheerful aspect happy and hopeful all right now said he sherman sure to be thrashed joe johnston is in command dr darby says when the oft mentioned joseph the malcontent gave up his command to hood he remarked with a smile i hope you will be able to stop sherman it was more than i could do general johnston is not of mr ancrum's way of thinking as to his own powers for he stayed here several days after he was ordered to the front he must have known he could do no good and i am of his opinion when the wagon in which i was to travel to flat rock drove up to the door covered with a tent like white cloth in my embarrassment for an opening in the conversation i asked the driver's name he showed great hesitation in giving it but at last said my name is sherman adding and now i see by your face that you won't go with me my name is against me these times here he grinned and remarked but you would leave lincolnton that name was the last drop in my cup but i gave him mrs glover's reason for staying here general johnston had told her this might be the safest place after all he thinks the yankees are making straight for richmond and general lee's rear and will go by camden and lancaster leaving lincolnton on their west flank the mcleans are kind people they ask no rent for for their rooms only 20 a week for firewood twenty dollars and such dollars mere waste paper mrs munroe took up my photograph book in which i have a picture of all the yankee generals i want to see the men who are to be our masters said she not mine i answered thank god come what may this was a free fight we had as much right to fight to get out as they had to fight to keep us in if they try to play the masters anywhere upon the habitable globe will i go never to see a yankee and if i die on the way so much the better then i sat down and wrote to my husband in language much worse than anything i can put in this book as i wrote i was blinded by tears of rage indeed i nearly wept myself away february 26th mrs munroe offered me religious books which i declined being already provided with the lamentations of jeremiah the psalms of david the denunciations of hosea and above all the patient wail of job job is my comforter now i should be so thankful to know life never would be any worse with me my husband is well and has been ordered to join the great retreater i am bodily comfortable if somewhat dingily lodged and i daily part with my raiment for food we find no one who will exchange eatables for confederate money so we are devouring our clothes opportunities for social enjoyment are not wanting miss middleton and isabella often drink a cup of tea with me one might search the whole world and not find two cleverer or more agreeable women miss middleton is brilliant and accomplished she must have been a hard student all her life she knows everybody worth knowing and she has been everywhere then she is so high bred high hearted pure and true she is so clean minded she could not harbor a wrong thought she is utterly unselfish a devoted daughter and sister she is one among the many large brained women a kind providence has thrown in my way such as mrs mccord daughter of judge cheves mary preston darby mrs emory granddaughter of old franklin the american wise man and mrs jefferson davis how i love to praise my friends as a ray of artificial sunshine mrs munroe sent me an examiner daniel thinks we are at the last gasp and now england and france are bound to step in england must know if the united states of america are triumphant they will tackle her next and france must wonder if she will not have to give up mexico my faith fails me it is all too late no help for us now from god or man thomas daniel says was now to ravage georgia but sherman from all accounts has done that work once for all there will be no aftermath they say no living thing is found in sherman's track only chimneys like telegraph poles to carry the news of sherman's army backward in all that tropical down pour mrs munroe sent me overshoes and an umbrella with the message come over i went for it would be as well to drown in the streets as to hang myself at home to my own bedpost at mrs munroe's i met a miss mcdaniel her father for seven years was the methodist preacher at our negro church the negro church is in a grove just opposite mulberry house she says her father has so often described that fine old establishment and its beautiful lawn live oaks etc now i dare say there stand at mulberry only sherman's sentinels stacks of chimneys we have made up our minds for the worst mulberry house is no doubt razed to the ground miss mcdaniel was inclined to praise us she said as a general rule the episcopal minister went to the family mansion and the methodist missionary preached to the negroes and dined with the overseer at his house but at mulberry her father always stayed at the house and the family were so kind and attentive to him it was rather pleasant to hear one's family so spoken of among strangers so well equipped to brave the weather armed cap a pie so to speak i continued my prowl farther afield and brought up at the middletons i may have surprised them for at such an inclement season they hardly expected a visitor never however did lonely old woman receive such a warm and hearty welcome now we know the worst are we growing hardened we avoid all allusion to columbia we never speak of home and we begin to deride the certain poverty that lies ahead how it pours could i live many days in solitary confinement things are beginning to be unbearable but i must sit down and be satisfied my husband is safe so far let me be thankful it is no worse with me but there is the gnawing pain all the same what is the good of being here at all our world has simply gone to destruction and across the way the fair lydia languishes she has not even my resources against ennui she has no isabella no miss middleton two as brilliant women as any in christendom oh how does she stand it i mean to go to church if it rains cats and dogs my feet are wet two or three times a day we never take cold our hearts are too hot within us for that a carriage was driven up to the door as i was writing i began to tie on my bonnet and said to myself in the glass oh you lucky woman i was all in a tremble so great was my haste to be out of this mrs glover had the carriage she came for me to go and hear mr martin preach he lifts our spirits from this dull earth he takes us up to heaven that i will not deny still he can not hold my attention my heart wanders and my mind strays back to south carolina oh vandal sherman what are you at there hard hearted wretch that you are a letter from general chesnut who writes from camp near charlotte under date of february 28th i thank you a thousand thousand times for your kind letters they are now my only earthly comfort except the hope that all is not yet lost we have been driven like a wild herd from our country and it is not from a want of spirit in the people or soldiers nor from want of energy and competency in our commanders the restoration of joe johnston it is hoped will redound to the advantage of our cause and the reestablishment of our fortunes i am still in not very agreeable circumstances for the last four days completely water bound i am informed that a detachment of yankees were sent from liberty hill to camden with a view to destroying all the houses mills and provisions about that place no particulars have reached me you know i expected the worst that could be done and am fully prepared for any report which may be made it would be a happiness beyond expression to see you even for an hour i have heard nothing from my poor old father i fear i shall never see him again such is the fate of war i do not complain i have deliberately chosen my lot and am prepared for any fate that awaits me my care is for you and i trust still in the good cause of my country and the justice and mercy of god it was a lively rushing young set that south carolina put to the fore they knew it was a time of imminent danger and that the fight would be ten to one they expected to win by activity energy and enthusiasm then came the wet blanket the croakers now these are posing wrapping cæsar's mantle about their heads to fall with dignity those gallant youths who dashed so gaily to the front lie mostly in bloody graves well for them maybe there are worse things than honorable graves wearisome thoughts late in life we are to begin anew and have laborious difficult days ahead we have contradictory testimony governor aiken has passed through saying sherman left columbia as he found it and was last heard from at cheraw dr chisolm walked home with me he says that is the last version of the story now my husband wrote that he himself saw the fires which burned up columbia the first night his camp was near enough to the town for that they say sherman has burned lancaster that sherman nightmare that ghoul that hyena but i do not believe it he takes his time there are none to molest him he does things leisurely and deliberately why stop to do so needless a thing as burn lancaster court house the jail and the tavern as i remember it that description covers lancaster a raiding party they say did for camden no train from charlotte yesterday rumor says sherman is in charlotte february 29th trying to brave it out they have plenty yet let our men freeze and starve in their prisons would you be willing to be as wicked as they are a thousand times no but we must feed our army first if we can do so much as that our captives need not starve if lincoln would consent to exchange prisoners but men are nothing to the united states things to throw away if they send our men back they strengthen our army and so again their policy is to keep everybody and everything here in order to help starve us out that too is what sherman's destruction means to starve us out young brevard asked me to play accompaniments for him the guitar is my instrument or was so i sang and played to my own great delight it was a distraction then i made egg nog for the soldier boys below and came home have spent a very pleasant evening begone dull care you and i never agree ellen and i are shut up here it is rain rain everlasting rain as our money is worthless are we not to starve heavens how grateful i was to day when mrs mclean sent me a piece of chicken i think the emptiness of my larder has leaked out to day mrs munroe sent me hot cakes and eggs for my breakfast
march 5th mary preston went back to mulberry with me from columbia she found a man there tall enough to take her in to dinner tom boykin who is six feet four the same height as her father tom was very handsome in his uniform and mary prepared for a nice time but he looked as if he would so much rather she did not talk to him and he set her such a good example saying never a word old colonel chesnut came for us when the train stopped quashie shiny black was seen on his box as glossy and perfect in his way as his blooded bays but the old colonel would stop and pick up the dirtiest little negro i ever saw who was crying by the roadside this ragged little black urchin was made to climb up and sit beside quash it spoilt the symmetry of the turn out but it was a character touch and the old gentleman knows no law but his own will he had a biscuit in his pocket which he gave this sniffling little negro who proved to be his man scip's son i was ill at mulberry and never left my room doctor boykin came more military than medical colonel chesnut brought him up also teams who said he was down in the mouth our men were not fighting as they should we had only pluck and luck and a dogged spirit of fighting to offset their weight in men and munitions of war i wish i could remember team's words this is only his idea his language was quaint and striking no grammar but no end of sense and good feeling old colonel chesnut catching a word began his litany saying numbers will tell napoleon you know etc etc at mulberry the war has been ever afar off but threats to take the silver came very near indeed silver that we had before the revolution silver that mrs chesnut brought from philadelphia jack cantey and doctor boykin came back on the train with us wade hampton is the hero sweet may dacre lord byron and disraeli make their rosebuds catholic may dacre is another aurora raby i like disraeli because i find so many clever things in him i like the sparkle and the glitter carlyle does not hold up his hands in holy horror of us because of african slavery lord lyons1 has gone against us lord derby and louis napoleon are silent in our hour of direst need people call me cassandra for i cry that outside hope is quenched from the outside no help indeed cometh to this beleaguered land march 7th mrs middleton was dolorous indeed general lee had warned the planters about combahee etc that they must take care of themselves now he could not do it confederate soldiers had committed some outrages on the plantations and officers had punished them promptly she poured contempt upon yancey's letter to lord russell 2 it was the letter of a shopkeeper not in the style of a statesman at all we called to see mary mcduffie 3 she asked mary preston what doctor boykin had said of her husband as we came along in the train she heard it was something very complimentary mary p tried to remember and to repeat it all to the joy of the other mary who liked to hear nice things about her husband mary was amazed to hear of the list of applicants for promotion one delicate minded person accompanied his demand for advancement by a request for a written description of the manassas battle he had heard colonel chesnut give such a brilliant account of it in governor cobb's room the merrimac 4 business has come like a gleam of lightning illumining a dark scene our sky is black and lowering the judge saw his little daughter at my window and he came up he was very smooth and kind it was really a delightful visit not a disagreeable word was spoken he abused no one whatever for he never once spoke of any one but himself and himself he praised without stint he did not look at me once though he spoke very kindly to me march 10th second year of confederate independence i write daily for my own diversion these mémoires pour servir may at some future day afford facts about these times and prove useful to more important people than i am i do not wish to do any harm or to hurt any one if any scandalous stories creep in they can easily be burned it is hard in such a hurry as things are now to separate the wheat from the chaff now that i have made my protest and written down my wishes i can scribble on with a free will and free conscience congress at the north is down on us they talk largely of hanging slave owners they say they hold port royal as we did when we took it originally from the aborigines who fled before us so we are to be exterminated and improved à l'indienne from the face of the earth medea when asked country wealth husband children all are gone and now what remains answered medea remains there is a time in most men's lives when they resemble job sitting among the ashes and drinking in the full bitterness of complicated misfortune march 11th a freshman came quite eager to be instructed in all the wiles of society he wanted to try his hand at a flirtation and requested minute instructions as he knew nothing whatever he was so very fresh dance with her he was told and talk with her walk with her and flatter her dance until she is warm and tired then propose to walk in a cool shady piazza it must be a somewhat dark piazza begin your promenade slowly warm up to your work draw her arm closer and closer then break her wing heavens what is that break her wing why you do not know even that put your arm round her waist and kiss her after that it is all plain sailing she comes down when you call like the coon to captain scott you need not fire captain etc the aspirant for fame as a flirt followed these lucid directions literally but when he seized the poor girl and kissed her she uplifted her voice in terror and screamed as if the house was on fire so quick sharp and shrill were her yells for help that the bold flirt sprang over the banister upon which grew a strong climbing rose this he struggled through and ran toward the college taking a bee line he was so mangled by the thorns that he had to go home and have them picked out by his family the girl's brother challenged him there was no mortal combat however for the gay young fellow who had led the freshman's ignorance astray stepped forward and put things straight an explanation and an apology at every turn hushed it all up now we all laughed at this foolish story most heartily but mr venable remained grave and preoccupied and was asked why are you so unmoved it is funny i like more probable fun i have been in college and i have kissed many a girl but never a one scrome yet last saturday was the bloodiest we have had in proportion to numbers 1 the enemy lost 1,500 the handful left at home are rushing to arms at last bragg has gone to join beauregard at columbus miss old abe truly took the field in that scotch cap of his mrs mccord 2 the eldest daughter of langdon cheves got up a company for her son raising it at her own expense she has the brains and energy of a man to day she repeated a remark of a low country gentleman who is dissatisfied this government confederate protects neither person nor property fancy the scornful turn of her lip some one asked for langdon cheves her brother oh langdon she replied coolly he is a pure patriot he has no ambition while i was there he was letting confederate soldiers ditch through his garden and ruin him at their leisure cotton is five cents a pound and labor of no value at all it commands no price whatever people gladly hire out their negroes to have them fed and clothed which latter can not be done cotton osnaburg at 37 1 2 cents a yard leaves no chance to clothe them langdon was for martial law and making the bloodsuckers disgorge their ill gotten gains we poor fools who are patriotically ruining ourselves will see our children in the gutter while treacherous dogs of millionaires go rolling by in their coaches coaches that were acquired by taking advantage of our necessities this terrible battle of the ships monitor merrimac etc all hands on board the cumberland went down she fought gallantly and fired a round as she sank the congress ran up a white flag she fired on our boats as they went up to take off her wounded she was burned the worst of it is that all this will arouse them to more furious exertions to destroy us they hated us so before but how now in columbia i do not know a half dozen men who would not gaily step into jeff davis's shoes with a firm conviction that they would do better in every respect than he does the monstrous conceit the fatuous ignorance of these critics it is pleasant to hear mrs mccord on this subject when they begin to shake their heads and tell us what jeff davis ought to do march 12th in the naval battle the other day we had twenty five guns in all the enemy had fifty four in the cumberland forty four in the st lawrence besides a fleet of gunboats filled with rifled cannon why not they can have as many as they please no pent up utica contracts their powers the whole boundless world being theirs to recruit in ours is only this one little spot of ground the blockade or stockade which hems us in with only the sky open to us and for all that how tender footed and cautious they are as they draw near an anonymous letter purports to answer colonel chesnut's address to south carolinians now in the army of the potomac the man says all that bosh is no good he knows lots of people whose fathers were notorious tories in our war for independence and made fortunes by selling their country their sons have the best places and they are cowards and traitors still names are given of course floyd and pillow1 are suspended from their commands because of fort donelson the people of tennessee demand a like fate for albert sidney johnston they say he is stupid can human folly go further than this tennessee madness i did mrs blank a kindness i told the women when her name came up that she was childless now but that she had lost three children i hated to leave her all alone women have such a contempt for a childless wife now they will be all sympathy and goodness i took away her reproach among women march 13th mr chesnut fretting and fuming from the poor old blind bishop downward everybody is besetting him to let off students theological and other from going into the army one comfort is that the boys will go mr chesnut answers wait until you have saved your country before you make preachers and scholars when you have a country there will be no lack of divines students scholars to adorn and purify it he says he is a one idea man that idea is to get every possible man into the ranks professor le conte1 is an able auxiliary he has undertaken to supervise and carry on the powder making enterprise the very first attempted in the confederacy and mr chesnut is proud of it it is a brilliant success thanks to le conte mr chesnut receives anonymous letters urging him to arrest the judge as seditious they say he is a dangerous and disaffected person his abuse of jeff davis and the council is rabid mr chesnut laughs and throws the letters into the fire disaffected to jeff davis says he disaffected to the council that don't count he knows what he is about he would not injure his country for the world read uncle tom's cabin again these negro women have a chance here that women have nowhere else they can redeem themselves the impropers can they can marry decently and nothing is remembered against these colored ladies it is not a nice topic but mrs stowe revels in it how delightfully pharisaic a feeling it must be to rise superior and fancy we are so degraded as to defend and like to live with such degraded creatures around us such men as legree and his women the best way to take negroes to your heart is to get as far away from them as possible as far as i can see southern women do all that missionaries could do to prevent and alleviate evils the social evil has not been suppressed in old england or in new england in london or in boston people in those places expect more virtue from a plantation african than they can insure in practise among themselves with all their own high moral surroundings light education training and support lady mary montagu says only men and women at last male and female created he them says the bible there are cruel graceful beautiful mothers of angelic evas north as well as south i dare say the northern men and women who came here were always hardest for they expected an african to work and behave as a white man we do not i have often thought from observation truly that perfect beauty hardens the heart and as to grace what so graceful as a cat a tigress or a panther much love admiration worship hardens an idol's heart it becomes utterly callous and selfish it expects to receive all and to give nothing it even likes the excitement of seeing people suffer i speak now of what i have watched with horror and amazement topsys i have known but none that were beaten or ill used used evas are mostly in the heaven of mrs stowe's imagination people can't love things dirty ugly and repulsive simply because they ought to do so but they can be good to them at a distance that's easy you see i can not rise very high i can only judge by what i see march 14th thank god for a ship it has run the blockade with arms and ammunition there are no negro sexual relations half so shocking as mormonism and yet the united states government makes no bones of receiving mormons into its sacred heart mr venable said england held her hand over the malignant and the turbaned turk to save and protect him slaves seraglio and all but she rolls up the whites of her eyes at us when slavery bad as it is is stepping out into freedom every moment through christian civilization they do not grudge the turk even his bag and bosphorus privileges to a recalcitrant wife it is here yawns the sack there rolls the sea etc and france the bold the brave the ever free she has not been so tender footed in algiers but then the you are another argument is a shabby one you see says mary preston sagaciously we are white christian descendants of huguenots and cavaliers and they expect of us different conduct went in mrs preston's landau to bring my boarding school girls here to dine at my door met j f who wanted me then and there to promise to help him with his commission or put him in the way of one at the carriage steps i was handed in by gus smith who wants his brother made commissary the beauty of it all is they think i have some influence and i have not a particle the subject of mr chesnut's military affairs promotions etc is never mentioned by me march 15th when we came home from richmond there stood warren nelson propped up against my door lazily waiting for me the handsome creature he said he meant to be heard so i walked back with him to the drawing room they are wasting their time dancing attendance on me i can not help them let them shoulder their musket and go to the wars like men after tea came mars kit he said for a talk but that mr preston would not let him have for mr preston had arrived some time before him mr preston said mars kit thought it bad form to laugh after that you may be sure a laugh from mars kit was secured again and again he was forced to laugh with a will i reversed oliver wendell holmes's good resolution never to be as funny as he could i did my very utmost mr venable interrupted the fun which was fast and furious with the very best of bad news newbern shelled and burned cotton turpentine everything there were 5,000 north carolinians in the fray 12,000 yankees now there stands goldsboro one more step and we are cut in two the railroad is our backbone like the blue ridge and the alleghanies with which it runs parallel so many discomforts no wonder we are down hearted mr venable thinks as we do garnett is our most thorough scholar lamar the most original and the cleverest of our men l q c lamar time fails me to write all his name then there is r m t hunter muscoe russell garnett and his northern wife that match was made at my house in washington when garnett was a member of the united states congress march 17th back to the congaree house to await my husband who has made a rapid visit to the wateree region as we drove up mr chesnut said did you see the stare of respectful admiration e r bestowed upon you so curiously prolonged i could hardly keep my countenance yes my dear child i feel the honor of it though my individual self goes for nothing in it i am the wife of the man who has the appointing power just now with so many commissions to be filled i am nearly forty and they do my understanding the credit to suppose i can be made to believe they admire my mature charms they think they fool me into thinking that they believe me charming there is hardly any farce in the world more laughable last night a house was set on fire last week two houses the red cock crows in the barn our troubles thicken indeed when treachery comes from that dark quarter when the president first offered johnston pettigrew a brigadier generalship his answer was not yet too many men are ahead of me who have earned their promotion in the field i will come after them not before so far i have done nothing to merit reward etc he would not take rank when he could get it i fancy he may cool his heels now waiting for it he was too high and mighty there was another conscientious man burnet of kentucky he gave up his regiment to his lieutenant colonel when he found the lieutenant colonel could command the regiment and burnet could not maneuver it in the field he went into the fight simply as an aide to floyd modest merit just now is at a premium william gilmore simms is here read us his last poetry have forgotten already what it was about it was not tiresome however and that is a great thing when people will persist in reading their own rhymes i did not hear what mr preston was saying the last piece of richmond news mr chesnut said as he went away and he looked so fagged out i asked no questions i knew it was bad at daylight there was a loud knocking at my door i hurried on a dressing gown and flew to open the door mrs chesnut mrs m says please don't forget her son mr chesnut she hears has come back please get her son a commission he must have an office i shut the door in the servant's face if i had the influence these foolish people attribute to me why should i not help my own i have a brother two brothers in law and no end of kin all gentlemen privates and privates they would stay to the end of time before they said a word to me about commissions after a long talk we were finally disgusted and the men went off to the bulletin board whatever else it shows good or bad there is always woe for some house in the killed and wounded we have need of stout hearts i feel a sinking of mine as we drive near the board march 18th my war archon is beset for commissions and somebody says for every one given you make one ingrate and a thousand enemies as i entered miss mary stark's i whispered he has promised to vote for louis what radiant faces to my friend miss mary said your son in law what is he doing for his country he is a tax collector then spoke up the stout old girl look at my cheek it is red with blushing for you a great hale hearty young man fie on him fie on him for shame tell his wife run him out of the house with a broomstick send him down to the coast at least fancy my cheeks i could not raise my eyes to the poor lady so mercilessly assaulted my face was as hot with compassion as the outspoken miss mary pretended hers to be with vicarious mortification went to see sweet and saintly mrs bartow she read us a letter from mississippi not so bad more men there than the enemy suspected and torpedoes to blow up the wretches when they came next to see mrs izard she had with her a relative just from the north this lady had asked seward for passports and he told her to hold on a while the road to south carolina will soon be open to all open and safe to day mrs arthur hayne heard from her daughter that richmond is to be given up mrs buell is her daughter met mr chesnut who said new madrid1 has been given up i do not know any more than the dead where new madrid is it is bad all the same this giving up i can't stand it the hemming in process is nearly complete the ring of fire is almost unbroken mr chesnut's negroes offered to fight for him if he would arm them he pretended to believe them he says one man can not do it the whole country must agree to it he would trust such as he would select and he would give so many acres of land and his freedom to each one as he enlisted mrs albert rhett came for an office for her son john i told her mr chesnut would never propose a kinsman for office but if any one else would bring him forward he would vote for him certainly as he is so eminently fit for position now he is a private march 19th he who runs may read conscription means that we are in a tight place this war was a volunteer business to morrow conscription begins the dernier ressort the president has remodeled his cabinet leaving bragg for north carolina his war minister is randolph of virginia a union man par excellence watts of alabama is attorney general and now too late by one year when all the mechanics are in the army mallory begins to telegraph captain ingraham to build ships at any expense we are locked in and can not get the requisites for naval architecture says a magniloquent person henry frost says all hands wink at cotton going out why not send it out and buy ships every now and then there is a holocaust of cotton burning says the magniloquent conscription has waked the rip van winkles the streets of columbia were never so crowded with men to fight and to be made to fight are different things to my small wits whenever people were persistent united and rose in their might no general however great succeeded in subjugating them have we not swamps forests rivers mountains every natural barrier the carthaginians begged for peace because they were a luxurious people and could not endure the hardship of war though the enemy suffered as sharply as they did factions among themselves is the rock on which we split now for the great soul who is to rise up and lead us why tarry his footsteps march 20th the merrimac is now called the virginia i think these changes of names so confusing and so senseless like the french royal bengal tiger national tiger etc rue this and next day rue that the very days and months a symbol and nothing signified i was lying on the sofa in my room and two men slowly walking up and down the corridor talked aloud as if necessarily all rooms were unoccupied at this midday hour i asked maum mary who they were yeadon and barnwell rhett jr they abused the council roundly and my husband's name arrested my attention afterward when yeadon attacked mr chesnut mr chesnut surprised him by knowing beforehand all he had to say naturally i had repeated the loud interchange of views i had overheard in the corridor first nathan davis called then gonzales who presented a fine soldierly appearance in his soldier clothes and the likeness to beauregard was greater than ever nathan all the world knows is by profession a handsome man general gonzales told us what in the bitterness of his soul he had written to jeff davis he regretted that he had not been his classmate then he might have been as well treated as northrop in any case he would not have been refused a brigadiership citing general trapier and tom drayton he had worked for it had earned it they had not to his surprise mr davis answered him and in a sharp note of four pages mr davis demanded from whom he quoted not his classmate general gonzales responded from the public voice only now he will fight for us all the same but go on demanding justice from jeff davis until he get his dues at least until one of them gets his dues for he means to go on hitting jeff davis over the head whenever he has a chance i am afraid said i you will find it a hard head to crack he replied in his flowery spanish way jeff davis will be the sun radiating all light heat and patronage he will not be a moon reflecting public opinion for he has the soul of a despot he delights to spite public opinion see people abused him for making crittenden brigadier straightway he made him major general and just after a blundering besotted defeat too also he told the president in that letter napoleon made his generals after great deeds on their part and not for having been educated at st cyr or brie or the polytechnique etc etc nathan davis sat as still as a sioux warrior not an eyelash moved and yet he said afterward that he was amused while the spaniard railed at his great namesake gonzales said mrs slidell would proudly say that she was a creole they were such fools they thought creole meant here nathan interrupted pleasantly at the st charles in new orleans on the bill of fare were creole eggs when they were brought to a man who had ordered them with perfect simplicity he held them up why they are only hens eggs after all what in heaven's name he expected them to be who can say smiled nathan the elegant one lady says as i sit reading in the drawing room window while maum mary puts my room to rights i clothe my negroes well i could not bear to see them in dirt and rags it would be unpleasant to me another lady yes well so do i but not fine clothes you know i feel now it was one of our sins as a nation the way we indulged them in sinful finery we will be punished for it last night mrs pickens met general cooper madam knew general cooper only as our adjutant general and mr mason's brother in law in her slow graceful impressive way her beautiful eyes eloquent with feeling she inveighed against mr davis's wickedness in always sending men born at the north to command at charleston general cooper is on his way to make a tour of inspection there now the dear general settled his head on his cravat with the aid of his forefinger he tugged rather more nervously with the something that is always wrong inside of his collar and looked straight up through his spectacles some one crossed the room stood back of mrs pickens and murmured in her ear general cooper was born in new york sudden silence dined with general cooper at the prestons general hampton and blanton duncan were there also the latter a thoroughly free and easy western man handsome and clever more audacious than either perhaps he pointed to buck sally buchanan campbell preston what's that girl laughing at poor child how amazed she looked he bade them not despair all the nice young men would not be killed in the war there would be a few left for himself he could give them no hope mrs duncan was uncommonly healthy mrs duncan is also lovely we have seen her march 24th i was asked to the tognos tea so refused a drive with mary preston as i sat at my solitary casemate waiting for the time to come for the tognos saw mrs preston's landau pass and mr venable making mary laugh at some of his army stories as only mr venable can already i felt that i had paid too much for my whistle that is the togno tea the gibbeses trenholms edmund rhett there edmund rhett has very fine eyes and makes fearful play with them he sits silent and motionless with his hands on his knees his head bent forward and his eyes fixed upon you i could think of nothing like it but a setter and a covey of partridges as to president davis he sank to profounder deeps of abuse of him than even gonzales i quoted yancey a crew may not like their captain but if they are mad enough to mutiny while a storm is raging all hands are bound to go to the bottom after that i contented myself with a mild shake of the head when i disagreed with him and at last i began to shake so persistently it amounted to incipient palsy jeff davis he said is conceited wrong headed wranglesome obstinate a traitor now i have borne much in silence said i at last but that is pernicious nonsense do not let us waste any more time listening to your quotations from the mercury he very good naturedly changed the subject which was easy just then for a delicious supper was on the table ready for us but doctor gibbes began anew the fighting he helped me to some pâté not foie gras said madame togno pâté perdreaux doctor gibbes however gave it a flavor of his own eat it said he it is good for you rich and wholesome healthy as cod liver oil a queer thing happened at the post office a man saw a small boy open with a key the box of the governor and the council take the contents of the box and run for his life of course this man called to the urchin to stop the urchin did not heed but seeing himself pursued began tearing up the letters and papers he was caught and the fragments were picked up finding himself a prisoner he pointed out the negro who gave him the key the negro was arrested governor pickens called to see me to day we began with fort sumter for an hour did we hammer at that fortress we took it gun by gun he was very pleasant and friendly in his manner james chesnut has been so nice this winter so reasonable and considerate that is for a man the night i came from madame togno's instead of making a row about the lateness of the hour he said he was so wide awake and so hungry i put on my dressing gown and scrambled some eggs etc there on our own fire and with our feet on the fender and the small supper table between us we enjoyed the supper and glorious gossip rather a pleasant state of things when one's own husband is in good humor and cleverer than all the men outside this afternoon the entente cordiale still subsisting maum mary beckoned me out mysteriously but mr chesnut said speak out old woman nobody here but myself mars nathum davis wants to speak to her said she so i hurried off to the drawing room maum mary flapping her down at the heels shoes in my wake he's gwine bekase somebody done stole his boots how could he stay bedout boots so nathan said good by then we met general gist maum mary still hovering near and i congratulated him on being promoted he is now a brigadier this he received with modest complaisance i knowed he was a general said maum mary as he passed on he told me as soon as he got in his room befo his boy put down his trunks as nathan the unlucky said good by he informed me that a mr reed from montgomery was in the drawingroom and wanted to see me mr reed had traveled with our foreign envoy yancey i was keen for news from abroad mr reed settled that summarily mr yancey says we need not have one jot of hope he could bowstring mallory for not buying arms in time the very best citizens wanted to depose the state government and take things into their own hands the powers that be being inefficient western men are hurrying to the front bestirring themselves in two more months we shall be ready what could i do but laugh i do hope the enemy will be considerate and charitable enough to wait for us mr reed's calm faith in the power of mr yancey's eloquence was beautiful to see he asked for mr chesnut i went back to our rooms swelling with news like a pouter pigeon mr chesnut said well four hours a call from nathan davis of four hours men are too absurd so i bear the honors of my forty years gallantly i can but laugh mr nathan davis went by the five o'clock train i said it is now about six or seven maybe eight i have had so many visitors mr reed of alabama is asking for you out there he went without a word but i doubt if he went to see mr reed my laughing had made him so angry at last lincoln threatens us with a proclamation abolishing slavery1 here in the free southern confederacy and they say mcclellan is deposed they want more fighting i mean the government whose skins are safe they want more fighting and trust to luck for the skill of the new generals march 28th i did leave with regret maum mary she was such a good well informed old thing my molly though perfection otherwise does not receive the confidential communications of new made generals at the earliest moment she is of very limited military information maum mary was the comfort of my life she saved me from all trouble as far as she could seventy if she is a day she is spry and active as a cat of a curiosity that knows no bounds black and clean also she knows a joke at first sight and she is honest i fancy the negroes are ashamed to rob people as careless as james chesnut and myself one night just before we left the congaree house mr chesnut had forgotten to tell some all important thing to governor gist who was to leave on a public mission next day so at the dawn of day he put on his dressing gown and went to the governor's room he found the door unlocked and the governor fast asleep he shook him half asleep the governor sprang up and threw his arms around mr chesnut's neck and said honey is it you the mistake was rapidly set right and the bewildered plenipotentiary was given his instructions mr chesnut came into my room threw himself on the sofa and nearly laughed himself to extinction imitating again and again the pathetic tone of the governor's greeting mr chesnut calls lawrence adolphe but says he is simply perfect as a servant mary stevens said i thought cousin james the laziest man alive until i knew his man lawrence lawrence will not move an inch or lift a finger for any one but his master mrs middleton politely sent him on an errand lawrence too was very polite hours after she saw him sitting on the fence of the front yard didn't you go she asked no ma'am i am waiting for mars jeems mrs middleton calls him now mr take it easy my very last day's experience at the congaree i was waiting for mars jeems in the drawing room when a lady there declared herself to be the wife of an officer in clingman's regiment a gentleman who seemed quite friendly with her told her all mr chesnut said thought intended to do wrote and felt i asked are you certain of all these things you say of colonel chesnut the man hardly deigned to notice this impertinent interruption from a stranger presuming to speak but who had not been introduced after he went out the wife of clingman's officer was seized with an intuitive curiosity madam will you tell me your name i gave it adding i dare say i showed myself an intelligent listener when my husband's affairs were under discussion at first i refused to give my name because it would have embarrassed her friend if she had told him who i was the man was mr chesnut's secretary but i had never seen him before a letter from kate says she had been up all night preparing david's things little serena sat up and helped her mother they did not know that they would ever see him again upon reading it i wept and james chesnut cursed the yankees gave the girls a quantity of flannel for soldiers shirts also a string of pearls to be raffled for at the gunboat fair mary witherspoon has sent a silver tea pot we do not spare our precious things now our silver and gold what are they when we give up to war our beloved
march 3d hetty the handsome and constance the witty came the former too prudish to read lost and saved by mrs norton after she had heard the plot conny was making a bonnet for me just as she was leaving the house her friendly labors over my husband entered and quickly ordered his horse it is so near dinner i began but i am going with the president i am on duty he goes to inspect the fortifications the enemy once more are within a few miles of richmond then we prepared a luncheon for him constance cary remained with me after she left i sat down to romola and i was absorbed in it how hardened we grow to war and war's alarms the enemy's cannon or our own are thundering in my ears and i was dreadfully afraid some infatuated and frightened friend would come in to cheer to comfort and interrupt me am i the same poor soul who fell on her knees and prayed and wept and fainted as the first gun boomed from fort sumter once more we have repulsed the enemy but it is humiliating indeed that he can come and threaten us at our very gates whenever he so pleases if a forlorn negro had not led them astray and they hanged him for it on tuesday night unmolested they would have walked into richmond surely there is horrid neglect or mismanagement somewhere march 4th the enemy has been reenforced and is on us again met wade hampton who told me my husband was to join him with some volunteer troops so i hurried home such a cavalcade rode up to luncheon captain smith lee and preston hampton the handsomest the oldest and the youngest of the party this was at the prestons smith lee walked home with me alarm bells ringing horsemen galloping wagons rattling dr h stopped us to say beast butler was on us with sixteen thousand men how scared the doctor looked and after all it was only a notice to the militia to turn out and drill march 5th tom fergurson walked home with me he told me of colonel dahlgren's1 death and the horrid memoranda found in his pocket he came with secret orders to destroy this devoted city hang the president and his cabinet and burn the town fitzhugh lee was proud that the ninth virginia captured him found mrs semmes covering her lettuces and radishes as calmly as if yankee raiders were a myth while beast butler holds fortress monroe he will make things lively for us on the alert must we be now march 7th shopping and paid 30 for a pair of gloves 50 for a pair of slippers 24 for six spools of thread 32 for five miserable shabby little pocket handkerchiefs when i came home found mrs webb at her hospital there was a man who had been taken prisoner by dahlgren's party he saw the negro hanged who had misled led them unintentionally in all probability he saw dahlgren give a part of his bridle to hang him details are melancholy as emerson says this dahlgren had also lost a leg constance cary in words too fine for the occasion described the homely scene at my house how i prepared sandwiches for my husband and broke with trembling hand the last bottle of anything to drink in the house a bottle i destined to go with the sandwiches she called it a hector and andromache performance march 8th mrs preston's story as we walked home she told me she had just been to see a lady she had known more than twenty years before she had met her in this wise one of the chambermaids of the st charles hotel new orleans told mrs preston's nurse it was when mary preston was a baby that up among the servants in the garret there was a sick lady and her children the maid was sure she was a lady and thought she was hiding from somebody mrs preston went up knew the lady had her brought down into comfortable rooms and nursed her until she recovered from her delirium and fever she had run away indeed and was hiding herself and her children from a worthless husband now she has one son in a yankee prison one mortally wounded and the last of them dying there under her eyes of consumption this last had married here in richmond not wisely and too soon for he was a mere boy his pay as a private was eleven dollars a month and his wife's family charged him three hundred dollars a month for her board so he had to work double tides do odd jobs by night and by day and it killed him by exposure to cold in this bitter climate to which his constitution was unadapted they had been in vicksburg during the siege and during the bombardment sought refuge in a cave the roar of the cannon ceasing they came out gladly for a breath of fresh air at the moment when they emerged a bomb burst there among them so to speak struck the son already wounded and smashed off the arm of a beautiful little grandchild not three years old there was this poor little girl with her touchingly lovely face and her arm gone this mutilated little martyr mrs preston said was really to her the crowning touch of the woman's affliction mrs preston put up her hand her baby face haunts me march 11th letters from home including one from my husband's father now over ninety written with his own hand and certainly his own mind still i quote bad times worse coming starvation stares me in the face neither john's nor james's overseer will sell me any corn now what has the government to do with the fact that on all his plantations he made corn enough to last for the whole year and by the end of january his negroes had stolen it all poor old man he has fallen on evil days after a long life of ease and prosperity to day i read the blithedale romance blithedale leaves such an unpleasant impression i like pleasant kindly stories now that we are so harrowed by real life tragedy is for our hours of ease march 12th an active campaign has begun everywhere kilpatrick still threatens us bragg has organized his fifteen hundred of cavalry to protect richmond why can't my husband be made colonel of that it is a new regiment no he must be made a general now says mary preston doctor darby is at the mercy of both yankees and the rolling sea and i am anxious enough but instead of taking my bed and worrying mamma i am taking stock of our worldly goods and trying to arrange the wedding paraphernalia for two girls there is love making and love making in this world what a time the sweethearts of that wretch young shakespeare must have had what experiences of life's delights must have been his before he evolved the romeo and juliet business from his own internal consciousness also that delicious beatrice and rosalind the poor creature that he left his second best bedstead to came in second best all the time no doubt and she hardly deserved more fancy people wondering that shakespeare and his kind leave no progeny like themselves shakespeare's children would have been half his only the other half only the second best bedstead's what would you expect of that commingling of materials goethe used his lady loves as school books are used he studied them from cover to cover got all that could be got of self culture and knowledge of human nature from the study of them and then threw them aside as if of no further account in his life byron never could forget lord byron poet and peer and mauvais sujet and he must have been a trying lover like talking to a man looking in the glass at himself lady byron was just as much taken up with herself so they struck each other and bounded apart since i wrote this mrs stowe has taken byron in hand but i know a story which might have annoyed my lord more than her and lady byron's imagination of wickedness for he posed a fiend but was tender and kind a clerk in a country store asked my sister to lend him a book he wanted something to read the days were so long what style of book would you prefer she said poetry any particular poet brown i hear him much spoken of browning no brown short that is what they call him byron you mean no i mean the poet brown oh you wish you had lived in the time of the shakespeare creature he knew all the forms and phases of true love straight to one's heart he goes in tragedy or comedy he never misses fire he has been there in slang phrase no doubt the man's bare presence gave pleasure to the female world he saw women at their best and he effaced himself he told no tales of his own life compare with him old sad solemn sublime sneering snarling fault finding milton a man whose family doubtless found les absences délicieuses that phrase describes a type of man at a touch it took a frenchwoman to do it but there is an italian picture of milton taken in his youth and he was as beautiful as an angel no doubt but love flies before everlasting posing and preaching the deadly requirement of a man always to be looked up to a domestic tyrant grim formal and awfully learned milton was only a mere man for he could not do without women when he tired out the first poor thing who did not fall down worship and obey him and see god in him and she ran away he immediately arranged his creed so that he could take another wife for wife he must have a la mohammedan creed the deer stealer never once thought of justifying theft simply because he loved venison and could not come by it lawfully shakespeare was a better man or may i say a purer soul than self upholding calvinistic puritanic king killing milton there is no muddling of right and wrong in shakespeare and no pharisaical stuff of any sort then george deas joined us fresh from mobile where he left peace and plenty he went to sixteen weddings and twenty seven tea parties for breakfast he had everything nice lily told of what she had seen the day before at the spottswood she was in the small parlor waiting for someone and in the large drawing room sat hood solitary sad with crutches by his chair he could not see them mrs buckner came in and her little girl who when she spied hood bounded into the next room and sprang into his lap hood smoothed her little dress down and held her close to him she clung around his neck for a while and then seizing him by the beard kissed him to an illimitable extent prettiest picture i ever saw said lily the soldier and the child john r thompson sent me a new york herald only three days old it is down on kilpatrick for his miserable failure before richmond also it acknowledges a defeat before charleston and a victory for us in florida general grant is charmed with sherman's successful movements says he has destroyed millions upon millions of our property in mississippi i hope that may not be true and that sherman may fail as kilpatrick did now if we still had stonewall or albert sidney johnston where joe johnston and polk are i would not give a fig for sherman's chances the yankees say that at last they have scared up a man who succeeds and they expect him to remedy all that has gone wrong so they have made their brutal suwarrow grant lieutenant general doctor at the prestons proposed to show me a man who was not an f f v until we came here we had never heard of our social position we do not know how to be rude to people who call to talk of social position seems vulgar down our way that sort of thing was settled one way or another beyond a peradventure like the earth and the sky we never gave it a thought we talked to whom we pleased and if they were not comme il faut we were ever so much more polite to the poor things no reflection on virginia everybody comes to richmond somebody counted fourteen generals in church to day and suggested that less piety and more drilling of commands would suit the times better there were lee longstreet morgan hoke clingman whiting pegram elzey gordon and bragg now since dahlgren failed to carry out his orders the yankees disown them disavowing all he was not sent here to murder us all to hang the president and burn the town there is the note book however at the executive office with orders to hang and burn march 15th old mrs chesnut is dead a saint is gone and james chesnut is broken hearted he adored his mother i gave 375 for my mourning which consists of a black alpaca dress and a crepe veil with bonnet gloves and all it came to 500 before the blockade such things as i have would not have been thought fit for a chamber maid everybody is in trouble mrs davis says paper money has depreciated so much in value that they can not live within their income so they are going to dispense with their carriage and horses march 18th went out to sell some of my colored dresses what a scene it was such piles of rubbish and mixed up with it such splendid parisian silks and satins a mulatto woman kept the shop under a roof in an out of the way old house the ci devant rich white women sell to and the negroes buy of this woman after some whispering among us buck said sally is going to marry a man who has lost an arm and she is proud of it the cause glorifies such wounds annie said meekly i fear it will be my fate to marry one who has lost his head tudy has her eyes on one who has lost an eye what a glorious assortment of noble martyrs and heroes the bitterness of this kind of talk is appalling general lee had tears in his eyes when he spoke of his daughter in law just dead that lovely little charlotte wickham mrs roony lee roony lee says beast butler was very kind to him while he was a prisoner the beast has sent him back his war horse the lees are men enough to speak the truth of friend or enemy fearing not the consequences march 19th a new experience molly and lawrence have both gone home and i am to be left for the first time in my life wholly at the mercy of hired servants mr chesnut being in such deep mourning for his mother we see no company i have a maid of all work tudy came with an account of yesterday's trip to petersburg constance cary raved of the golden ripples in tudy's hair tudy vanished in a halo of glory and constance cary gave me an account of a wedding as it was given to her by major von borcke the bridesmaids were dressed in black the bride in confederate gray homespun she had worn the dress all winter but it had been washed and turned for the wedding the female critics pronounced it flabby dabby they also said her collar was only net and she wore a cameo breastpin her bonnet was self made march 24th yesterday we went to the capitol grounds to see our returned prisoners we walked slowly up and down until jeff davis was called upon to speak there i stood almost touching the bayonets when he left me i looked straight into the prisoners faces poor fellows they cheered with all their might and i wept for sympathy and enthusiasm i was very deeply moved these men were so forlorn so dried up and shrunken with such a strange look in some of their eyes others so restless and wild looking others again placidly vacant as if they had been dead to the world for years a poor woman was too much for me she was searching for her son he had been expected back she said he was taken prisoner at gettysburg she kept going in and out among them with a basket of provisions she had brought for him to eat it was too pitiful she was utterly unconscious of the crowd the anxious dread expectation hurry and hope which led her on showed in her face a sister of mrs lincoln is here she brings the freshest scandals from yankeeland she says she rode with lovejoy a friend of hers commands a black regiment two southern horrors a black regiment and lovejoy march 31st met preston hampton constance cary was with me she showed her regard for him by taking his overcoat and leaving him in a drenching rain what boyish nonsense he talked said he was in love with miss dabney now that his love was so hot within him that he was waterproof the rain sizzed and smoked off it did not so much as dampen his ardor or his clothes
march 5th is the sea drying up is it going up into mist and coming down on us in a water spout the rain it raineth every day the weather typifies our tearful despair on a large scale it is also lent now a quite convenient custom for we in truth have nothing to eat so we fast and pray and go dragging to church like drowned rats to be preached at my letter from my husband was so well what in a woman you would call heart broken that i began to get ready for a run up to charlotte my hat was on my head my traveling bag in my hand and ellen was saying which umbrella ma'am stop ellen said i someone is speaking out there a tap came at the door and miss mclean threw the door wide open as she said in a triumphant voice permit me to announce general chesnut as she went off she sang out oh does not a meeting like this make amends we went after luncheon to see mrs munroe my husband wanted to thank her for all her kindness to me i was awfully proud of him i used to think that everybody had the air and manners of a gentleman i know now that these accomplishments are things to thank god for father o'connell came in fresh from columbia and with news at last sherman's men had burned the convent mrs munroe had pinned her faith to sherman because he was a roman catholic but father o'connell was there and saw it the nuns and girls marched to the old hampton house mrs preston's now and so saved it they walked between files of soldiers men were rolling tar barrels and lighting torches to fling on the house when the nuns came columbia is but dust and ashes burned to the ground men women and children have been left there homeless houseless and without one particle of food reduced to picking up corn that was left by sherman's horses on picket grounds and parching it to stay their hunger how kind my friends were on this my fête day mrs rutledge sent me a plate of biscuit mrs munroe nearly enough food supplies for an entire dinner miss mclean a cake for dessert ellen cooked and served up the material happily at hand very nicely indeed there never was a more successful dinner my heart was too full to eat but i was quiet and calm at least i spared my husband the trial of a broken voice and tears as he stood at the window with his back to the room he said where are they now my old blind father and my sister day and night i see her leading him out from under his own rooftree that picture pursues me persistently but come let us talk of pleasanter things to which i answered where will you find them he took off his heavy cavalry boots and ellen carried them away to wash the mud off and dry them she brought them back just as miss middleton walked in in his agony while struggling with those huge boots and trying to get them on he spoke to her volubly in french she turned away from him instantly as she saw his shoeless plight and said to me i had not heard of your happiness i did not know the general was here not until next day did we have time to remember and laugh at that outbreak of french miss middleton answered him in the same language he told her how charmed he was with my surroundings and that he would go away with a much lighter heart since he had seen the kind people with whom he would leave me i asked my husband what that correspondence between sherman and hampton meant this while i was preparing something for our dinner his back was still turned as he gazed out of the window he spoke in the low and steady monotone that characterized our conversation the whole day and yet there was something in his voice that thrilled me as he said the second day after our march from columbia we passed the m s he was a bonded man and not at home his wife said at first that she could not find forage for our horses but afterward she succeeded in procuring some i noticed a very handsome girl who stood beside her as she spoke and i suggested to her mother the propriety of sending her out of the track of both armies things were no longer as heretofore there was so much straggling so many camp followers with no discipline on the outskirts of the army the girl answered quickly i wish to stay with my mother that very night a party of wheeler's men came to our camp and such a tale they told of what had been done at the place of horror and destruction the mother left raving the outrage had been committed before her very face she having been secured first after this crime the fiends moved on there were only seven of them they had been gone but a short time when wheeler's men went in pursuit at full speed and overtook them cut their throats and wrote upon their breasts these were the seven but the girl oh she was dead are his critics as violent as ever against the president asked i when recovered from pity and horror sometimes i think i am the only friend he has in the world at these dinners which they give us everywhere i spoil the sport for i will not sit still and hear jeff davis abused for things he is no more responsible for than any man at that table once i lost my temper and told them it sounded like arrant nonsense to me and that jeff davis was a gentleman and a patriot with more brains than the assembled company you lost your temper truly said i and i did not know it i thought i was as cool as i am now in washington when we left jeff davis ranked second to none in intellect and may be first from the south and mrs davis was the friend of mrs emory mrs joe johnston and mrs montgomery blair and others of that circle now they rave that he is nobody and never was and she i asked oh you would think to hear them that he found her yesterday in a mississippi swamp well in the french revolution it was worse when a man failed he was guillotined mirabeau did not die a day too soon even mirabeau he is gone with despair in my heart i left that railroad station allan green walked home with me i met his wife and his four ragged little boys a day or so ago she is the neatest the primmest the softest of women her voice is like the gentle cooing of a dove that lowering black future hangs there all the same the end of the war brings no hope of peace or of security to us ellen said i had a little piece of bread and a little molasses in store for my dinner to day march 6th to day came a godsend even a small piece of bread and the molasses had become things of the past my larder was empty when a tall mulatto woman brought a tray covered by a huge white serviette ellen ushered her in with a flourish saying mrs mcdaniel's maid the maid set down the tray upon my bare table and uncovered it with conscious pride there were fowls ready for roasting sausages butter bread eggs and preserves i was dumb with delight after silent thanks to heaven my powers of speech returned and i exhausted myself in messages of gratitude to mrs mcdaniel missis you oughtn't to let her see how glad you was said ellen it was a lettin of yo'sef down mrs glover gave me some yarn and i bought five dozen eggs with it from a wagon eggs for lent to show that i have faith yet in humanity i paid in advance in yarn for something to eat which they promised to bring to morrow had they rated their eggs at 100 a dozen in confederick money i would have paid it as readily as 10 but i haggle in yarn for the millionth part of a thread two weeks have passed and the rumors from columbia are still of the vaguest no letter has come from there no direct message or messenger my god cried dr frank miles but it is strange can it be anything so dreadful they dare not tell us dr st julien ravenel has grown pale and haggard with care his wife and children were left there dr brumby has at last been coaxed into selling me enough leather for the making of a pair of shoes else i should have had to give up walking he knew my father well he intimated that in some way my father helped him through college his own money had not sufficed and so william c preston and my father advanced funds sufficient to let him be graduated then my uncle charles miller married his aunt i listened in rapture for all this tended to leniency in the leather business and i bore off the leather gladly when asked for confederate money in trade i never stop to bargain i give them 20 or 50 cheerfully for anything either sum march 8th colonel childs came with a letter from my husband and a newspaper containing a full account of sherman's cold blooded brutality in columbia then we walked three miles to return the call of my benefactress mrs mcdaniel they were kind and hospitable at her house but my heart was like lead my head ached and my legs were worse than my head and then i had a nervous chill so i came home went to bed and stayed there until the fants brought me a letter saying my husband would be here today then i got up and made ready to give him a cheerful reception soon a man called troy by name the same who kept the little corner shop so near my house in columbia and of whom we bought things so often we had fraternized he now shook hands with me and looked in my face pitifully we seemed to have been friends all our lives he says they stopped the fire at the methodist college perhaps to save old mr mccartha's house mr sheriff dent being burned out took refuge in our house he contrived to find favor in yankee eyes troy relates that a yankee officer snatched a watch from mrs mccord's bosom the soldiers tore the bundles of clothes that the poor wretches tried to save from their burning homes and dashed them back into the flames they meant to make a clean sweep they were howling round the fires like demons these yankees in their joy and triumph at our destruction well we have given them a big scare and kept them miserable for four years the little handful of us a woman we met on the street stopped to tell us a painful coincidence a general was married but he could not stay at home very long after the wedding when his baby was born they telegraphed him and he sent back a rejoicing answer with an inquiry is it a boy or a girl he was killed before he got the reply was it not sad his poor young wife says he did not live to hear that his son lived the kind woman added sorrowfully died and did not know the sect of his child let us hope it will be a methodist said isabella the irrepressible at the venison feast isabella heard a good word for me and one for general chesnut's air of distinction a thing people can not give themselves try as ever they may lord byron says everybody knows a gentleman when he sees one and nobody can tell what it is that makes a gentleman he knows the thing but he can't describe it now there are some french words that can not be translated and we all know the thing they mean gracieuse and svelte for instance as applied to a woman not that anything was said of me like that far from it i am fair fat forty and jolly and in my unbroken jollity as far as they know they found my charm you see she doesn't howl she doesn't cry she never never tells anybody about what she was used to at home and what she has lost high praise and i intend to try and deserve it ever after march 10th went to church crying to ellen it is lent we must fast and pray when i came home my good fairy colonel childs had been here bringing rice and potatoes and promising flour he is a trump he pulled out his pocket book and offered to be my banker he stood there on the street miss middleton and isabella witnessing the generous action and straight out offered me money no put up that said i i am not a beggar and i never will be to die is so much easier alas after that flourish of trumpets when he came with a sack of flour i accepted it gratefully i receive things i can not pay for but money is different there i draw a line imaginary perhaps once before the same thing happened our letters of credit came slowly in 1845 when we went unexpectedly to europe and our letters were to follow us i was a poor little inoffensive bride and a british officer who guessed our embarrassment for we did not tell him he came over with us on the ship asked my husband to draw on his banker until the letters of credit should arrive it was a nice thing for a stranger to do we have never lost what we never had we have never had any money only unlimited credit for my husband's richest kind of a father insured us all manner of credit it was all a mirage only at last and it has gone just as we drew nigh to it colonel childs says eight of our senators are for reconstruction and that a ray of light has penetrated inward from lincoln who told judge campbell that southern land would not be confiscated march 12th better to day a long long weary day in grief has passed away i suppose general chesnut is somewhere but where that is the question only once has he visited this sad spot which holds he says all that he cares for on earth unless he comes or writes soon i will cease or try to cease this wearisome looking looking looking for him march 13th my husband at last did come for a visit of two hours brought lawrence who had been to camden and was there indeed during the raid my husband has been ordered to chester s c we are surprised to see by the papers that we behaved heroically in leaving everything we had to be destroyed without one thought of surrender we had not thought of ourselves from the heroic point of view isaac mclaughlin hid and saved everything we trusted him with a grateful negro is isaac march 15th lawrence says miss chesnut is very proud of the presence of mind and cool self possession she showed in the face of the enemy she lost after all only two bottles of champagne two of her brother's gold headed canes and her brother's horses including claudia the brood mare that he valued beyond price and her own carriage and a fly brush boy called battis whose occupation in life was to stand behind the table with his peacock feathers and brush the flies away he was the sole member of his dusky race at mulberry who deserted ole marster to follow the yankees now for our losses at the hermitage added to the gold headed canes and claudia we lost every mule and horse and president davis's beautiful arabian was captured john's were there too my light dragoon johnny and heavy swell is stripped light enough for the fight now jonathan whom we trusted betrayed us and the plantation and mills mulberry house etc were saved by claiborne that black rascal who was suspected by all the world claiborne boldly affirmed that mr chesnut would not be hurt by destroying his place the invaders would hurt only the negroes mars jeems said he hardly ever come here and he takes only a little sompen nur to eat when he do come fever continuing i sent for st julien ravenel we had a wrangle over the slavery question then he fell foul of everybody who had not conducted this war according to his ideas ellen had something nice to offer him thanks to the ever bountiful childs but he was too angry too anxious too miserable to eat he pitched into ellen after he had disposed of me ellen stood glaring at him from the fireplace her blue eye nearly white her other eye blazing as a comet last sunday he gave her some dover's powders for me directions were written on the paper in which the medicine was wrapped and he told her to show these to me then to put what i should give her into a wine glass and let me drink it ellen put it

flingin bout she go to sleep sweet as a suckling baby an she slep two days an nights an now she heap better and ellen withdrew from the controversy well all is well that ends well mrs chesnut you took opium enough to kill several persons you were worried out and needed rest you came near getting it thoroughly you were in no danger from your disease but your doctor and your nurse combined were deadly maybe i was saved by the adulteration the feebleness of confederate medicine a letter from my husband written at chester court house on march 15th says in the morning i send lieut ogden with lawrence to lincolnton to bring you down i have three vacant rooms one with bedsteads chairs washstands basins and pitchers the two others bare you can have half of a kitchen for your cooking i have also at dr da vega's a room furnished to which you are invited board also you can take your choice if you can get your friends in lincolnton to assume charge of your valuables only bring such as you may need here perhaps it will be better to bring bed and bedding and the other indispensables chester s c march 21,1865 another flitting has occurred captain ogden came for me the splendid childs was true as steel to the last surely he is the kindest of men captain ogden was slightly incredulous when i depicted the wonders of colonel childs's generosity so i skilfully led out the good gentleman for inspection and he walked to the train with us he offered me confederate money silver and gold and finally offered to buy our cotton and pay us now in gold of course i laughed at his overflowing bounty and accepted nothing but i begged him to come down to chester or camden and buy our cotton of general chesnut there on the train after leaving lincolnton as captain ogden is a refugee has had no means of communicating with his home since new orleans fell and was sure to know how refugees contrive to live i beguiled the time acquiring information from him when people are without a cent how do they live i asked i am about to enter the noble band of homeless houseless refugees and confederate pay does not buy one's shoe strings to which he replied sponge sponge why did you not let colonel childs pay your bills i have no bills said i we have never made bills anywhere not even at home where they would trust us and nobody would trust me in lincolnton why did you not borrow his money general chesnut could pay him at his leisure i am by no means sure general chesnut will ever again have any money said i as the train rattled and banged along and i waved my handkerchief in farewell to miss middleton isabella and other devoted friends i could only wonder if fate would ever throw me again with such kind clever agreeable congenial companions the mcleans refused to be paid for their rooms no plummet can sound the depths of the hospitality and kindness of the north carolina people misfortune dogged us from the outset everything went wrong with the train we broke down within two miles of charlotte and had to walk that distance which was pretty rough on an invalid barely out of a fever my spirit was further broken by losing an invaluable lace veil which was worn because i was too poor to buy a cheaper one that is if there were any veils at all for sale in our region my husband had ordered me to a house in charlotte kept by some great friends of his they established me in the drawing room a really handsome apartment they made up a bed there and put in a washstand and plenty of water with everything refreshingly clean and nice but it continued to be a public drawing room open to all so that i was half dead at night and wanted to go to bed the piano was there and the company played it the landlady announced proudly that for supper there were nine kinds of custard custard sounded nice and light so i sent for some but found it heavy potato pie i said ellen this may kill me though dover's powder did not don't you believe dat missis try we barricaded ourselves in the drawing room that night and left the next day at dawn arrived at the station we had another disappointment the train was behind time there we sat on our boxes nine long hours for the cars might come at any moment and we dared not move an inch from the spot finally the train rolled in overloaded with paroled prisoners but heaven helped us a kind mail agent invited us with two other forlorn women into his comfortable and clean mail car ogden true to his theory did not stay at the boarding house as we did some christian acquaintances took him in for the night this he explained with a grin my husband was at the chester station with a carriage we drove at once to mrs da vega's march 24th i have been ill but what could you expect my lines however have again fallen in pleasant places mrs da vega is young handsome and agreeable a kind and perfect hostess and as to the house my room is all that i could ask and leaves nothing to be desired so very fresh clean warm and comfortable is it it is the drawing room suddenly made into a bedroom for me but it is my very own we are among the civilized of the earth once more march 27th i have moved again and now i am looking from a window high with something more to see than the sky we have the third story of dr da vega's house which opens on the straight street that leads to the railroad about a mile off mrs bedon is the loveliest of young widows yesterday at church isaac hayne nestled so close to her cap strings that i had to touch him and say sit up josiah bedon was killed in that famous fight of the charleston light dragoons the dragoons stood still to be shot down in their tracks having no orders to retire they had been forgotten doubtless and they scorned to take care of themselves in this high and airy retreat as in richmond then in columbia and then in lincolnton my cry is still if they would only leave me here in peace and if i were sure things never could be worse with me again am i surrounded by old friends people seem to vie with each other to show how good they can be to me to day smith opened the trenches and appeared laden with a tray covered with a snow white napkin here was my first help toward housekeeping again mrs pride has sent a boiled ham a loaf of bread a huge pancake another neighbor coffee already parched and ground a loaf of sugar already cracked candles pickles and all the other things one must trust to love for now such money as we have avails us nothing even if there were anything left in the shops to buy we had a jolly luncheon james lowndes called the best of good company he said of buck she is a queen and ought to reign in a palace no prince charming yet no man has yet approached her that i think half good enough for her then mrs prioleau hamilton née levy came with the story of family progress not a royal one from columbia here before we left home said she major hamilton spread a map of the united states on the table and showed me with his finger where sherman was likely to go womanlike i demurred but suppose he does not choose to go that way pooh pooh what do you know of war so we set out my husband myself and two children all in one small buggy the 14th of february we took up our line of march and straight before sherman's men for five weeks we fled together by incessant hurrying and scurrying from pillar to post we succeeded in acting as a sort of avant courier of the yankee army without rest and with much haste we got here last wednesday and here we mean to stay and defy sherman and his legions much the worse for wear were we the first night their beauty sleep was rudely broken into at alston with a cry move on the yanks are upon us so they hurried on half awake to winnsboro but with no better luck there they had to lighten the ship leave trunks etc and put on all sail for this time the yankees were only five miles behind whip and spur ride for your life was the cry sherman's objective point seemed to be our buggy said she for you know that when we got to lancaster sherman was expected there and he keeps his appointments that is he kept that one two small children were in our chariot and i began to think of the red sea expedition but we lost no time and soon we were in cheraw clearly out of the track we thanked god for all his mercies and hugged to our bosoms fond hopes of a bed and bath so much needed by all especially for the children at twelve o'clock general hardee himself knocked us up with word to march march for all the blue bonnets are over the border in mad haste we made for fayetteville when they said god bless your soul this is the seat of war now the battle ground where sherman and johnston are to try conclusions so we harked back as the hunters say and cut across country aiming for this place clean clothes my dear never a one except as we took off garment by garment and washed it and dried it by our camp fire with our loins girded and in haste i was snug and comfortable all that time in lincolnton to day stephen d lee's corps marched through only to surrender the camp songs of these men were a heartbreak so sad yet so stirring they would have warmed the blood of an icelander the leading voice was powerful mellow clear distinct pathetic sweet so i sat down as women have done before when they hung up their harps by strange streams and i wept the bitterness of such weeping music away away thou speakest to me of things which in all my long life i have not found and i shall not find there they go the gay and gallant few doomed the last gathering of the flower of southern pride to be killed or worse to a prison they continue to prance by light and jaunty they march with as airy a tread as if they still believed the world was all on their side and that there were no yankee bullets for the unwary what will joe johnston do with them now the hood melodrama is over though the curtain has not fallen on the last scene cassandra croaks and makes many mistakes but to day she believes that hood stock is going down when that style of enthusiasm is on the wane the rapidity of its extinction is miraculous it is like the snuffing out of a candle one moment white then gone forever no that is not right it is the snow flake on the river that is referred to i am getting things as much mixed as do the fine ladies of society lee and johnston have each fought a drawn battle only a few more dead bodies lie stiff and stark on an unknown battle field for we do not so much as know where these drawn battles took place teddy barnwell after sharing with me my first luncheon failed me cruelly he was to come for me to go down to the train and see isabella pass by one word with isabella worth a thousand ordinary ones so she has gone by and i've not seen her old colonel chesnut refuses to say grace but as he leaves the table audibly declares i thank god for a good dinner when asked why he did this odd thing he said my way is to be sure of a thing before i return thanks for it mayor goodwyn thanked sherman for promised protection to columbia soon after the burning began i received the wife of a post office robber the poor thing had done no wrong and i felt so sorry for her who would be a woman who that fool a weeping pining faithful woman she hath hard measures still when she hopes kindest and all her beauty only makes ingrates march 29th i was awakened with a bunch of violets from mrs pride violets always remind me of kate and of the sweet south wind that blew in the garden of paradise part of my life then it all came back the dread unspeakable that lies behind every thought now thursday i find i have not spoken of the box car which held the preston party that day on their way to york from richmond in the party were mr and mrs lawson clay general and mrs preston and their three daughters captain rodgers and mr portman whose father is an english earl and connected financially and happily with portman square in my american ignorance i may not state mr portman's case plainly mr portman is of course a younger son then there was cellie and her baby and wet nurse with no end of servants male and female in this ark they slept ate and drank such being the fortune of war we were there but a short time but mr portman during that brief visit of ours was said to have eaten three luncheons and the number of his drinks toddies so called were counted too mr portman's contribution to the larder had been three small pigs they were however run over by the train and made sausage meat of unduly and before their time general lee says to the men who shirk duty this is the people's war when they tire i stop wigfall says it is all over the game is up he is on his way to texas and when the hanging begins he can step over into mexico i am plucking up heart such troops do i see go by every day they must turn the tide and surely they are going for something more than surrender it is very late and the wind flaps my curtain which seems to moan too late all this will end by making me a nervous lunatic yesterday while i was driving with mrs pride colonel mccaw passed us he called out i do hope you are in comfortable quarters very comfortable i replied oh mrs chesnut said mrs pride how can you say that perfectly comfortable and hope it may never be worse with me said i i have a clean little parlor 16 by 18 with its bare floor well scrubbed a dinner table six chairs and well that is all but i have a charming lookout from my window high my world is now thus divided into two parts where yankees are and where yankees are not as i sat disconsolate looking out ready for any new tramp of men and arms the magnificent figure of general preston hove in sight he was mounted on a mighty steed worthy of its rider followed by his trusty squire william walker who bore before him the general's portmanteau when i had time to realize the situation i perceived at general preston's right hand mr christopher hampton and mr portman who passed by soon mrs pride in some occult way divined or heard that they were coming here and she sent me at once no end of good things for my tea table general preston entered very soon after and with him clement clay of alabama the latter in pursuit of his wife's trunk i left it with the rev mr martin and have no doubt it is perfectly safe but where we have written to mr martin to inquire then wilmot de saussure appeared i am here he said to consult with general chesnut he and i always think alike he added emphatically slavery is stronger than ever if you think so said i you will find that for once you and general chesnut do not think alike he has held that slavery was a thing of the past this many a year i said to general preston i pass my days and nights partly at this window i am sure our army is silently dispersing men are moving the wrong way all the time they slip by with no songs and no shouts now they have given the thing up see for yourself look there for a while the streets were thronged with soldiers and then they were empty again but the marching now is without tap of drum march 31st mr prioleau hamilton told us of a great adventure mrs preston was put under his care on the train he soon found the only other women along were strictly unfortunate females as carlyle calls them beautiful and aggressive he had to communicate the unpleasant fact to mrs preston on account of their propinquity and was lost in admiration of her silent dignity her quiet self possession her calmness her deafness and blindness her thoroughbred ignoring of all that she did not care to see some women no matter how ladylike would have made a fuss or would have fidgeted but mrs preston dominated the situation and possessed her soul in innocence and peace met robert johnston from camden he has been a prisoner having been taken at camden the yankees robbed zack cantey of his forks and spoons when zack did not seem to like it they laughed at him when he said he did not see any fun in it they pretended to weep and wiped their eyes with their coat tails all this maddening derision zack said was as hard to bear as it was to see them ride off with his horse albine they stole all of mrs zack's jewelry and silver when the yankee general heard of it he wrote her a very polite note saying how sorry he was that she had been annoyed and returned a bundle of zack's love letters written to her before she was married robert johnston said miss chesnut was a brave and determined spirit one yankee officer came in while they were at breakfast and sat down to warm himself at the fire rebels have no rights miss chesnut said to him politely i suppose you have come to rob us please do so and go your presence agitates my blind old father the man jumped up in a rage and said what do you take me for a robber no indeed said she and for very shame he marched out empty handed
april 2d governor manning came to breakfast at our table the others had breakfasted hours before i looked at him in amazement as he was in full dress ready for a ball swallow tail and all and at that hour what is the matter with you nothing i am not mad most noble madam i am only going to the photographer my wife wants me taken thus he insisted on my going too and we captured mr chesnut and governor means 1 the latter presented me with a book a photo book in which i am to pillory all the celebrities doctor gibbes says the convention is in a snarl it was called as a secession convention a secession of places seems to be what it calls for first of all it has not stretched its eyes out to the yankees yet it has them turned inward introspection is its occupation still last night as i turned down the gas i said to myself certainly this has been one of the pleasantest days of my life i can only give the skeleton of it so many pleasant people so much good talk for after all it was talk talk talk à la caroline du sud and yet the day began rather dismally mrs capers and mrs tom middleton came for me and we drove to magnolia cemetery i saw william taber's broken column it was hard to shake off the blues after this graveyard business the others were off at a dinner party i dined tête à tête with langdon cheves so quiet so intelligent so very sensible withal there never was a pleasanter person or a better man than he while we were at table judge whitner tom frost and isaac hayne came they broke up our deeply interesting conversation for i was hearing what an honest and brave man feared for his country and then the rutledges dislodged the newcomers and bore me off to drive on the battery on the staircase met mrs izard who came for the same purpose on the battery governor adams 2 stopped us he had heard of my saying he looked like marshal pelissier and he came to say 1 john hugh means was elected governor of south carolina in 1850 and had long been an advocate of secession he was a delegate to the convention of 1860 and affixed his name to the ordinance of secession he was killed at the second battle of bull run in august 1862 2 james h adams was a graduate of yale who in 1832 strongly opposed nullification and in 1855 was elected governor of south carolina that at last i had made a personal remark which pleased him for once in my life when we came home mrs isaac hayne and chancellor carroll called to ask us to join their excursion to the island forts to morrow with them was william haskell last summer at the white sulphur he was a pale slim student from the university to day he is a soldier stout and robust a few months in camp with soldiering in the open air has worked this wonder camping out proves a wholesome life after all then came those nice sweet fresh pure looking pringle girls we had a charming topic in common their clever brother edward a letter from eliza b who is in montgomery mrs mallory got a letter from a lady in washington a few days ago who said that there had recently been several attempts to be gay in washington but they proved dismal failures the black republicans were invited and came and stared at their entertainers and their new republican companions looked unhappy while they said they were enchanted showed no ill temper at the hardly stifled grumbling and growling of our friends who thus found themselves condemned to meet their despised enemy i had a letter from the gwinns to day they say washington offers a perfect realization of goldsmith's deserted village celebrated my 38th birthday but i am too old now to dwell in public on that unimportant anniversary a long dusty day ahead on those windy islands never for me so i was up early to write a note of excuse to chancellor carroll my husband went i hope anderson will not pay them the compliment of a salute with shotted guns as they pass fort sumter as pass they must here i am interrupted by an exquisite bouquet from the rutledges are there such roses anywhere else in the world now a loud banging at my door i get up in a pet and throw it wide open oh said john manning standing there smiling radiantly pray excuse the noise i made i mistook the number i thought it was rice's room that is my excuse now that i am here come go with us to quinby's everybody will be there who are not at the island to be photographed is the rage just now we had a nice open carriage and we made a number of calls mrs izard the pringles and the tradd street rutledges the handsome ex governor doing the honors gallantly he had ordered dinner at six and we dined tete a tete if he should prove as great a captain in ordering his line of battle as he is in ordering a dinner it will be as well for the country as it was for me to day fortunately for the men the beautiful mrs joe heyward sits at the next table so they take her beauty as one of the goods the gods provide and it helps to make life pleasant with english grouse and venison from the west not to speak of the salmon from the lakes which began the feast they have me to listen an appreciative audience while they talk and mrs joe heyward to look at beauregard 1 called he is the hero of the hour that is he is believed to be capable of great things a hero worshiper was struck dumb because i said so far he has only been a captain of artillery or engineers or something i did not see him mrs wigfall did and reproached my laziness in not coming out last sunday at church beheld one of the peculiar local sights old negro maumas going up to the communion in their white turbans and kneeling devoutly around the chancel rail 1 pierre gustave toutant beauregard was born in new orleans in 1818 and graduated from west point in the class of 1838 he served in the war with mexico had been superintendent of the military academy at west point a few days only when in february 1861 he resigned his commission in the army of the united states and offered his services to the confederacy the morning papers say mr chesnut made the best shot on the island at target practice no war yet thank god likewise they tell me mr chesnut has made a capital speech in the convention not one word of what is going on now out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh says the psalmist not so here our hearts are in doleful dumps but we are as gay as madly jolly as sailors who break into the strong room when the ship is going down at first in our great agony we were out alone we longed for some of our big brothers to come out and help us well they are out too and now it is fort sumter and that ill advised anderson there stands fort sumter en evidence and thereby hangs peace or war wigfall 1 says before he left washington pickens our governor and trescott were openly against secession trescott does not pretend to like it now he grumbles all the time but governor pickens is fire eater down to the ground at the white house mrs davis wore a badge jeff davis is no seceder says mrs wigfall captain ingraham comments in his rapid way words tumbling over each other out of his mouth now charlotte wigfall meant that as a fling at those people i think better of men who stop to think it is too rash to rush on as some do and so adds mrs wigfall the eleventh hour men are rewarded the half hearted are traitors in this row april 3d met the lovely lucy holcombe now mrs governor pickens last night at isaac hayne's i saw miles now begging in dumb show for three violets she had in her 1 louis trezevant wigfall was a native of south carolina but removed to texas after being admitted to the bar and from that state was elected united states senator becoming an uncompromising defender of the south on the slave question after the war he lived in england but in 1873 settled in baltimore he had a wide southern reputation as a forcible and impassioned speaker breastpin she is a consummate actress and he well up in the part of male flirt so it was well done and you who are laughing in your sleeves at the scene where did you get that huge bunch oh there is no sentiment when there is a pile like that of anything oh oh to day at the breakfast table there was a tragic bestowal of heartsease on the well known inquirer who once more says in austere tones who is the flirt now and so we fool on into the black cloud ahead of us and after heartsease cometh rue april 4th mr hayne said his wife moaned over the hardness of the chaperones seats at st andrew's hall at a cecilia ball 1 she was hopelessly deposited on one for hours and the walls are harder my dear what are your feelings to those of the poor old fellows leaning there with their beautiful young wives waltzing as if they could never tire and in the arms of every man in the room watch their haggard weary faces the old boys you know at church i had to move my pew the lovely laura was too much for my boys they all made eyes at her and nudged each other and quarreled so for she gave them glance for glance wink blink and snicker as they would she liked it i say my dear the old husbands have not exactly a bed of roses their wives twirling in the arms of young men they hugging the wall while we were at supper at the haynes's wigfall was sent for to address a crowd before the mills house piazza like james fitz james when he visits glen alpin again it is to be in the saddle etc so let washington beware we were sad that we could not hear the speaking but the 1 the annual balls of the st cecilia society in charleston are still the social events of the season to become a member of the st cecilia society is a sort of presentation at court in the sense of giving social recognition to one who was without the pale supper was a consolation pâté de foie gras salad biscuit glacé and champagne frappé a ship was fired into yesterday and went back to sea is that the first shot how can one settle down to anything one's heart is in one's mouth all the time any moment the cannon may open on us the fleet come in april 6th the plot thickens the air is red hot with rumors the mystery is to find out where these utterly groundless tales originate in spite of all tom huger came for us and we went on the planter to take a look at morris island and its present inhabitants mrs wigfall and the cheves girls maxcy gregg and colonel whiting also john rutledge of the navy dan hamilton and william haskell john rutledge was a figurehead to be proud of he did not speak to us but he stood with a scotch shawl draped about him as handsome and stately a creature as ever queen elizabeth loved to look upon there came up such a wind we could not land i was not too sorry though it blew so hard i am never seasick colonel whiting explained everything about the forts what they lacked etc in the most interesting way and maxcy gregg supplemented his report by stating all the deficiencies and shortcomings by land beauregard is a demigod here to most of the natives but there are always seers who see and say they give you to understand that whiting has all the brains now in use for our defense he does the work and beauregard reaps the glory things seem to draw near a crisis and one must think colonel whiting is clever enough for anything so we made up our minds to day maxcy gregg and i as judges mr gregg told me that my husband was in a minority in the convention so much for cool sense when the atmosphere is phosphorescent mrs wigfall says we are mismatched she should pair with my cool quiet self poised colonel and her stormy petrel is but a male reflection of me april 8th yesterday mrs wigfall and i made a few visits at the first house they wanted mrs wigfall to settle a dispute was she indeed fifty five fancy her face more than ten years bestowed upon her so freely then mrs gibbes asked me if i had ever been in charleston before says charlotte wigfall to pay me for my snigger when that false fifty was flung in her teeth and she thinks this is her native heath and her name is mcgregor she said it all came upon us for breaking the sabbath for indeed it was sunday allen green came up to speak to me at dinner in all his soldier's toggery it sent a shiver through me tried to read margaret fuller ossoli but could not the air is too full of war news and we are all so restless went to see miss pinckney one of the last of the old world pinckneys she inquired particularly about a portrait of her father charles cotesworth pinckney 1 which she said had been sent by him to my husband's grandfather i gave a good account of it it hangs in the place of honor in the drawing room at mulberry she wanted to see my husband for his grandfather my father's friend was one of the handsomest men of his day we came home and soon mr robert gourdin and mr miles called governor manning walked in bowed gravely and seated himself by me again he bowed low in mock heroic style and with a grand wave of his hand said madame your country is invaded when i had breath to speak i asked what does he mean he meant this there 1 charles cotesworth pinckney was a brigadier general in the revolution and a member of the convention that framed the constitution of the united states he was an ardent federalist and twice declined to enter a national cabinet but in 1796 accepted the office of united states minister to france he was the federalist candidate for vice president in 1800 and for president in 1804 and 1808 other distinguished men in this family were thomas charles henry laurens and charles cotesworth pinckney the second are six men of war outside the bar talbot and chew have come to say that hostilities are to begin governor pickens and beauregard are holding a council of war mr chesnut then came in and confirmed the story wigfall next entered in boisterous spirits and said there was a sound of revelry by night in any stir or confusion my heart is apt to beat so painfully now the agony was so stifling i could hardly see or hear the men went off almost immediately and i crept silently to my room where i sat down to a good cry mrs wigfall came in and we had it out on the subject of civil war we solaced ourselves with dwelling on all its known horrors and then we added what we had a right to expect with yankees in front and negroes in the rear the slave owners must expect a servile insurrection of course said mrs wigfall to make sure that we were unhappy enough suddenly loud shooting was heard we ran out cannon after cannon roared we met mrs allen green in the passageway with blanched cheeks and streaming eyes governor means rushed out of his room in his dressing gown and begged us to be calm governor pickens said he has ordered in the plenitude of his wisdom seven cannon to be fired as a signal to the seventh regiment anderson will hear as well as the seventh regiment now you go back and be quiet fighting in the streets has not begun yet so we retired dr gibbes calls mrs allen green dame placid there was no placidity to day with cannon bursting and allen on the island no sleep for anybody last night the streets were alive with soldiers men shouting marching singing wigfall the stormy petrel is in his glory the only thoroughly happy person i see to day things seem to have settled down a little one can but hope still lincoln or seward has made such silly advances and then far sillier drawings back there may be a chance for peace after all things are happening so fast my husband has been made an aide de camp to general beauregard three hours ago we were quickly packing to go home the convention has adjourned now he tells me the attack on fort sumter may begin to night depends upon anderson and the fleet outside the herald says that this show of war outside of the bar is intended for texas john manning came in with his sword and red sash pleased as a boy to be on beauregard's staff while the row goes on he has gone with wigfall to captain hartstein with instructions mr chesnut is finishing a report he had to make to the convention mrs hayne called she had she said but one feeling pity for those who are not here jack preston willie alston the take life easys as they are called with john green the big brave have gone down to the islands volunteered as privates seven hundred men were sent over ammunition wagons were rumbling along the streets all night anderson is burning blue lights signs and signals for the fleet outside i suppose to day at dinner there was no allusion to things as they stand in charleston harbor there was an undercurrent of intense excitement there could not have been a more brilliant circle in addition to our usual quartette judge withers langdon cheves and trescott our two ex governors dined with us means and manning these men all talked so delightfully for once in my life i listened that over business began in earnest governor means had rummaged a sword and red sash from somewhere and brought it for colonel chesnut who had gone to demand the surrender of fort sumter and now patience we must wait why did that green goose anderson go into fort sumter then everything began to go wrong now they have intercepted a letter from him urging them to let him surrender he paints the horrors likely to ensue if they will not he ought to have thought of all that before he put his head in the hole april 12th anderson will not capitulate yesterday's was the merriest maddest dinner we have had yet men were audaciously wise and witty we had an unspoken foreboding that it was to be our last pleasant meeting mr miles dined with us to day mrs henry king rushed in saying the news i come for the latest news all the men of the king family are on the island of which fact she seemed proud while she was here our peace negotiator or envoy came in that is mr chesnut returned his interview with colonel anderson had been deeply interesting but mr chesnut was not inclined to be communicative he wanted his dinner he felt for anderson and had telegraphed to president davis for instructions what answer to give anderson etc he has now gone back to fort sumter with additional instructions when they were about to leave the wharf a h boykin sprang into the boat in great excitement he thought himself ill used with a likelihood of fighting and he to be left behind i do not pretend to go to sleep how can i if anderson does not accept terms at four the orders are he shall be fired upon i count four st michael's bells chime out and i begin to hope at half past four the heavy booming of a cannon i sprang out of bed and on my knees prostrate i prayed as i never prayed before there was a sound of stir all over the house pattering of feet in the corridors all seemed hurrying one way i put on my double gown and a shawl and went too it was to the housetop the shells were bursting in the dark i heard a man say waste of ammunition i knew my husband was rowing about in a boat somewhere in that dark bay and that the shells were roofing it over bursting toward the fort if anderson was obstinate colonel chesnut was to order the fort on one side to open fire certainly fire had begun the regular roar of the cannon there it was and who could tell what each volley accomplished of death and destruction the women were wild there on the housetop prayers came from the women and imprecations from the men and then a shell would light up the scene to night they say the forces are to attempt to land we watched up there and everybody wondered that fort sumter did not fire a shot to day miles and manning colonels now aides to beauregard dined with us the latter hoped i would keep the peace i gave him only good words for he was to be under fire all day and night down in the bay carrying orders etc last night or this morning truly up on the housetop i was so weak and weary i sat down on something that looked like a black stool get up you foolish woman your dress is on fire cried a man and he put me out i was on a chimney and the sparks had caught my clothes susan preston and mr venable then came up but my fire had been extinguished before it burst out into a regular blaze do you know after all that noise and our tears and prayers nobody has been hurt sound and fury signifying nothing a delusion and a snare louisa hamilton came here now this is a sort of news center jack hamilton her handsome young husband has all the credit of a famous battery which is made of railroad iron mr petigru calls it the boomerang because it throws the balls back the way they came so lou hamilton tells us during her first marriage she had no children hence the value of this lately achieved baby to divert louisa from the glories of the battery of which she raves we asked if the baby could talk yet no not exactly but he imitates the big gun when he hears that he claps his hands and cries boom boom her mind is distinctly occupied by three things lieutenant hamilton whom she calls randolph the baby and the big gun and it refuses to hold more pryor of virginia spoke from the piazza of the charleston hotel i asked what he said an irreverent woman replied oh they all say the same thing but he made great play with that long hair of his which he is always tossing aside somebody came in just now and reported colonel chesnut asleep on the sofa in general beauregard's room after two such nights he must be so tired as to be able to sleep anywhere just bade farewell to langdon cheves he is forced to go home and leave this interesting place says he feels like the man that was not killed at thermopylae i think he said that unfortunate had to hang himself when he got home for very shame maybe he fell on his sword which was the strictly classic way of ending matters i do not wonder at louisa hamilton's baby we hear nothing can listen to nothing boom boom goes the cannon all the time the nervous strain is awful alone in this darkened room richmond and washington ablaze say the papers blazing with excitement why not to us these last days events seem frightfully great we were all women on that iron balcony men are only seen at a distance now stark means marching under the piazza at the head of his regiment held his cap in his hand all the time he was in sight mrs means was leaning over and looking with tearful eyes when an unknown creature asked why did he take his hat off mrs means stood straight up and said he did that in honor of his mother he saw me she is a proud mother and at the same time most unhappy her lovely daughter emma is dying in there before her eyes of consumption at that moment i am sure mrs means had a spasm of the heart at least she looked as i feel sometimes she took my arm and we came in april 13th nobody has been hurt after all how gay we were last night reaction after the dread of all the slaughter we thought those dreadful cannon were making not even a battery the worse for wear fort sumter has been on fire anderson has not yet silenced any of our guns so the aides still with swords and red sashes by way of uniform tell us but the sound of those guns makes regular meals impossible none of us go to table tea trays pervade the corridors going everywhere some of the anxious hearts lie on their beds and moan in solitary misery mrs wigfall and i solace ourselves with tea in my room these women have all a satisfying faith god is on our side they say when we are shut in mrs wigfall and i ask why of course he hates the yankees we are told you'll think that well of him not by one word or look can we detect any change in the demeanor of these negro servants lawrence sits at our door sleepy and respectful and profoundly indifferent so are they all but they carry it too far you could not tell that they even heard the awful roar going on in the bay though it has been dinning in their ears night and day people talk before them as if they were chairs and tables they make no sign are they stolidly stupid or wiser than we are silent and strong biding their time so tea and toast came also came colonel manning red sash and sword to announce that he had been under fire and didn't mind it he said gaily it is one of those things a fellow never knows how he will come out until he has been tried now i know i am a worthy descendant of my old irish hero of an ancestor who held the british officer before him as a shield in the revolution and backed out of danger gracefully we talked of st valentine's eve or the maid of perth and the drop of the white doe's blood that sometimes spoiled all the war steamers are still there outside the bar and there are people who thought the charleston bar no good to charleston the bar is the silent partner or sleeping partner and in this fray it is doing us yeoman service april 15th i did not know that one could live such days of excitement some one called come out there is a crowd coming a mob it was indeed but it was headed by colonels chesnut and manning the crowd was shouting and showing these two as messengers of good news they were escorted to beauregard's headquarters fort sumter had surrendered those upon the housetops shouted to us the fort is on fire that had been the story once or twice before when we had calmed down colonel chesnut who had taken it all quietly enough if anything more unruffled than usual in his serenity told us how the surrender came about wigfall was with them on morris island when they saw the fire in the fort he jumped in a little boat and with his handkerchief as a white flag rowed over wigfall went in through a porthole when colonel chesnut arrived shortly after and was received at the regular entrance colonel anderson told him he had need to pick his way warily for the place was all mined as far as i can make out the fort surrendered to wigfall but it is all confusion our flag is flying there fire engines have been sent for to put out the fire everybody tells you half of something and then rushes off to tell something else or to hear the last news in the afternoon mrs preston 1 mrs joe heyward and i drove around the battery we were in an open carriage 1 caroline hampton a daughter of general wade hampton of the revolution was the wife of john s preston an ardent advocate of secession who served on the staff of beauregard at bull run and subsequently reached the rank of brigadier general what a changed scene the very liveliest crowd i think i ever saw everybody talking at once all glasses were still turned on the grim old fort russell 1 the correspondent of the london times was there they took him everywhere one man got out thackeray to converse with him on equal terms poor russell was awfully bored they say he only wanted to see the fort and to get news suitable to make up into an interesting article thackeray had become stale over the water mrs frank hampton 2 and i went to see the camp of the richland troops south carolina college had volunteered to a boy professor venable the mathematical intends to raise a company from among them for the war a permanent company this is a grand frolic no more for the students at least even the staid and severe of aspect clingman is here he says virginia and north carolina are arming to come to our rescue for now the north will swoop down on us of that we may be sure we have burned our ships we are obliged to go on now he calls us a poor little hot blooded headlong rash and troublesome sister state general mcqueen is in a rage because we are to send troops to virginia preston hampton is in all the flush of his youth and beauty six feet in stature and after all only in his teens he appeared in fine clothes and lemon colored kid gloves to grace the scene the camp in a fit of horse play seized him and rubbed him in the mud he fought manfully but took it all naturally as a good joke 1 william howard russell a native of dublin who served as a correspondent of the london times during the crimean war the indian mutiny the war of secession and the franco german war he has been familiarly known as bull run russell in 1875 he was honorary secretary to the prince of wales during the prince's visit to india 2 the sally baxter of the recently published thackeray letters to an american family mrs frank hampton knows already what civil war means her brother was in the new york seventh regiment so roughly received in baltimore frank will be in the opposite camp good stories there may be and to spare for russell the man of the london times who has come over here to find out our weakness and our strength and to tell all the rest of the world about us april 20 1861 home again at mulberry in those last days of my stay in charleston i did not find time to write a word and so we took fort sumter nous autres we mrs frank hampton and others in the passageway of the mills house between the reception room and the drawing room for there we held a sofa against all comers all the agreeable people south seemed to have flocked to charleston at the first gun that was after we had found out that bombarding did not kill anybody before that we wept and prayed and took our tea in groups in our rooms away from the haunts of men captain ingraham and his kind also took fort sumter from the battery with field glasses and figures made with their sticks in the sand to show what ought to be done wigfall chesnut miles manning took it rowing about the harbor in small boats from fort to fort under the enemy's guns with bombs bursting in air and then the boys and men who worked those guns so faithfully at the forts they took it too in their own way old colonel beaufort watts told me this story and many more of the jeunesse dorée under fire they took the fire easily as they do most things they had cotton bag bomb proofs at fort moultrie and when anderson's shot knocked them about some one called out cotton is falling then down went the kitchen chimney loaves of bread flew out and they cheered gaily shouting breadstuffs are rising willie preston fired the shot which broke anderson's flag staff mrs hampton from columbia telegraphed him well done willie she is his grandmother the wife or widow of general hampton of the revolution and the mildest sweetest gentlest of old ladies this shows how the war spirit is waking us all up colonel miles who won his spurs in a boat so william gilmore simms 1 said gave us this characteristic anecdote they met a negro out in the bay rowing toward the city with some plantation supplies etc are you not afraid of colonel anderson's cannon he was asked no sar mars anderson ain't daresn't hit me he know marster wouldn't low it i have been sitting idly to day looking out upon this beautiful lawn wondering if this can be the same world i was in a few days ago after the smoke and the din of the battle a calm april 22d arranging my photograph book on the first page colonel watts here goes a sketch of his life romantic enough surely beaufort watts bluest blood gentleman to the tips of his fingers chivalry incarnate he was placed in charge of a large amount of money in bank bills the money belonged to the state and he was to deposit it in the bank on the way he was obliged to stay over one night he put the roll on a table at his bedside locked himself in and slept the sleep of the righteous lo next day when he awaked the money was gone well all who knew him believed him innocent of course he searched and they searched high and low but to no purpose the money had vanished it was a damaging story 1 william gilmore simms the southern novelist was born in charleston in 1806 he was the author of a great many volumes dealing with southern life and at one time they were widely read in spite of his previous character and a cloud rested on him years afterward the house in which he had taken that disastrous sleep was pulled down in the wall behind the wainscot was found his pile of money how the rats got it through so narrow a crack it seemed hard to realize like the hole mentioned by mercutio it was not as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door but it did for beaufort watts until the money was found suppose that house had been burned or the rats had gnawed up the bills past recognition people in power understood how this proud man suffered those many years in silence many men looked askance at him the country tried to repair the work of blasting the man's character he was made secretary of legation to russia and was afterward our consul at santa fe de bogota when he was too old to wander far afield they made him secretary to all the governors of south carolina in regular succession i knew him more than twenty years ago as secretary to the governor he was a made up old battered dandy the soul of honor his eccentricities were all humored misfortune had made him sacred he stood hat in hand before ladies and bowed as i suppose sir charles grandison might have done it was hard not to laugh at the purple and green shades of his overblack hair he came at one time to show me the sword presented to colonel shelton for killing the only indian who was killed in the seminole war we bagged osceola and micanopy under a flag of truce that is they were snared not shot on the wing to go back to my knight errant he knelt handed me the sword and then kissed my hand i was barely sixteen and did not know how to behave under the circumstances he said leaning on the sword my dear child learn that it is a much greater liberty to shake hands with a lady than to kiss her hand i have kissed the empress of russia's hand and she did not make faces at me he looks now just as he did then he is in uniform covered with epaulettes aigulettes etc shining in the sun and with his plumed hat reins up his war steed and bows low as ever now i will bid farewell for a while as othello did to all the pomp pride and circumstance of glorious war and come down to my domestic strifes and troubles i have a sort of volunteer maid the daughter of my husband's nurse dear old betsy she waits on me because she so pleases besides i pay her she belongs to my father in law who has too many slaves to care very much about their way of life so maria whitaker came all in tears she brushes hair delightfully and as she stood at my back i could see her face in the glass maria are you crying because all this war talk scares you said i no ma'am what is the matter with you nothing more than common now listen let the war end either way and you will be free we will have to free you before we get out of this thing won't you be glad everybody knows mars jeems wants us free and it is only old marster holds hard he ain't going to free anybody any way you see and then came the story of her troubles now miss mary you see me married to jeems whitaker yourself i was a good and faithful wife to him and we were comfortable every way good house everything he had no cause of complaint but he has left me for heaven's sake why because i had twins he says they are not his because nobody named whitaker ever had twins maria is proud in her way and the behavior of this bad husband has nearly mortified her to death she has had three children in two years no wonder the man was frightened but then maria does not depend on him for anything she was inconsolable and i could find nothing better to say than come now maria never mind your old missis and marster are so good to you now let us look up something for the twins the twins are named john and jeems the latter for her false loon of a husband maria is one of the good colored women she deserved a better fate in her honest matrimonial attempt but they do say she has a trying temper jeems was tried and he failed to stand the trial april 23d note the glaring inconsistencies of life our chatelaine locked up eugene sue and returned even washington allston's novel with thanks and a decided hint that it should be burned at least it should not remain in her house bad books are not allowed house room except in the library under lock and key the key in the master's pocket but bad women if they are not white or serve in a menial capacity may swarm the house unmolested the ostrich game is thought a christian act such women are no more regarded as a dangerous contingent than canary birds would be if you show by a chance remark that you see some particular creature more shameless than the rest has no end of children and no beginning of a husband you are frowned down you are talking on improper subjects there are certain subjects pure minded ladies never touch upon even in their thoughts it does not do to be so hard and cruel it is best to let the sinners alone poor things if they are good servants otherwise do not dismiss them all that will come straight as they grow older and it does they are frantic one and all to be members of the church the methodist church is not so pure minded as to shut its eyes it takes them up and turns them out with a high hand if they are found going astray as to any of the ten commandments montgomery ala april 27 1861 here we are once more hon robert barnwell came with us his benevolent spectacles give him a most pickwickian expression we carolinians revere his goodness above all things everywhere when the car stopped the people wanted a speech and we had one stream of fervid oratory we came along with a man whose wife lived in washington he was bringing her to georgia as the safest place the alabama crowd are not as confident of taking fort pickens as we were of taking fort sumter baltimore is in a blaze they say colonel ben huger is in command there son of the olmutz huger general robert e lee son of light horse harry lee has been made general in chief of virginia with such men to the fore we have hope the new york herald says slavery must be extinguished if in blood it thinks we are shaking in our shoes at their great mass meetings we are jolly as larks all the same mr chesnut has gone with wade hampton 1 to see president davis about the legion wade wants to get up 1 wade hampton was a son of another wade hampton who was an aide to general jackson at the battle of new orleans and a grandson of still another wade hampton who was a general in the revolution he was not in favor of secession but when the war began he enlisted as a private and then raised a command of infantry cavalry and artillery which as hampton's legion won distinction in the war after the war he was elected governor of south carolina and was then elected to the united states senate the president came across the aisle to speak to me at church to day he was very cordial and i appreciated the honor wigfall is black with rage at colonel anderson's account of the fall of sumter wigfall did behave magnanimously but anderson does not seem to see it in that light catch me risking my life to save him again says wigfall he might have been man enough to tell the truth to those new yorkers however unpalatable to them a good word for us might have been we did behave well to him the only men of his killed he killed himself or they killed themselves firing a salute to their old striped rag mr chesnut was delighted with the way anderson spoke to him when he went to demand the surrender they parted quite tenderly anderson said if we do not meet again on earth i hope we may meet in heaven how wigfall laughed at anderson giving chesnut a howdy in the other world what a kind welcome the old gentlemen gave me one more affectionate and homely than the others slapped me on the back several bouquets were brought me and i put them in water around my plate then general owens gave me some violets which i put in my breastpin oh said my gutta percha hemphill 1 if i had known how those bouquets were to be honored i would have been up by daylight seeking the sweetest flowers governor moore came in and of course seats were offered him this is a most comfortable chair cried an overly polite person the most comfortable chair is beside mrs chesnut said the governor facing the music gallantly as he sank into it gracefully well done old fogies browne said these southern men have an awfully flattering way with women oh so many are descendants of irishmen and so the blarney remains yet even and in spite of their gray hairs for it was a group of silver gray flatterers yes blarney as well as bravery came in with the irish at mrs davis's reception dismal news for civil war seems certain at mrs toombs's reception mr stephens came by me twice before we have had it out on the subject of this confederacy once on the cars coming from georgia here once at a supper where he sat next to me to day he was not cheerful in his views i called him half hearted and accused him of looking back man after man came and interrupted the conversation with some frivle fravle but we held on he was deeply interesting and he gave me some new ideas as to our dangerous situation fears for the future and not exultation at our successes pervade his discourse dined at the president's and never had a pleasanter day he is as witty as he is wise he was very agreeable he took me in to dinner the talk was of washington nothing of our present difficulties a general anderson from alexandria d c was in doleful dumps he says the north are so much better prepared than we are they are organized or will be by general scott we are in wild confusion their army is the best in the world we are wretchedly armed etc etc they have ships and arms that were ours and theirs mrs walker resplendently dressed one of those gorgeously arrayed persons who fairly shine in the sun tells me she mistook the inevitable morrow for mr chesnut and added pass over the affront to my powers of selection i told her it was an insult to the palmetto flag think of a south carolina senator like that men come rushing in from washington with white lips crying danger danger it is very tiresome to have these people always harping on this the enemy's troops are the finest body of men we ever saw why did you not make friends of them i feel disposed to say we would have war and now we seem to be letting our golden opportunity pass we are not preparing for war there is talk talk talk in that congress lazy legislators and rash reckless headlong devil may care proud passionate unruly raw material for soldiers they say we have among us a regiment of spies men and women sent here by the wily seward why our newspapers tell every word there is to be told by friend or foe a two hours call from hon robert barnwell his theory is all would have been right if we had taken fort sumter six months ago he made this very plain to me he is clever if erratic i forget why it ought to have been attacked before at another reception mrs davis was in fine spirits captain dacier was here came over in his own yacht russell of the london times wondered how we had the heart to enjoy life so thoroughly when all the northern papers said we were to be exterminated in such a short time
april 2d dr trezevant attending mr chesnut who was ill came and found his patient gone he could not stand the news of that last battle he got up and dressed weak as he was and went forth to hear what he could for himself the doctor was angry with me for permitting this and more angry with him for such folly i made him listen to the distinction between feminine folly and virulent vagaries and nonsense he said he will certainly be salivated after all that calomel out in this damp weather to day the ladies in their landaus were bitterly attacked by the morning paper for lolling back in their silks and satins with tall footmen in livery driving up and down the streets while the poor soldiers wives were on the sidewalks it is the old story of rich and poor my little barouche is not here nor has james chesnut any of his horses here but then i drive every day with mrs mccord and mrs preston either of whose turnouts fills the bill the governor's carriage horses servants etc are splendid just what they should be why not april 14th our fair is in full blast we keep a restaurant our waitresses are mary and buck preston isabella martin and grace elmore april 15th trescott is too clever ever to be a bore that was proved to day for he stayed two hours as usual mr chesnut said four trescott was very surly calls himself ex secretary of state of the united states now nothing in particular of south carolina or the confederate states then he yawned what a bore this war is i wish it was ended one way or another he speaks of going across the border and taking service in mexico rubbish not much mexico for you i answered another patriot came then and averred i will take my family back to town that we may all surrender together i gave it up early in the spring trescott made a face behind backs and said lache the enemy have flanked beauregard at nashville there is grief enough for albert sidney johnston now we begin to see what we have lost we were pushing them into the river when general johnston was wounded beauregard was lying in his tent at the rear in a green sickness melancholy but no matter what the name of the malady he was too slow to move and lost all the advantage gained by our dead hero 1 without him there is no head to our western army pulaski has fallen what more is there to fall april 15th mrs middleton how did you settle molly's little difficulty with mrs mcmahan that piece of her mind that molly gave our landlady oh paid our way out of it of course and i apologized for molly gladden the hero of the palmettos in mexico is killed shiloh has been a dreadful blow to us last winter stephen my brother had it in his power to do such a nice thing for colonel gladden in the dark he heard his name also that he had to walk twenty five miles in alabama mud or go on an ammunition wagon so he introduced himself as a south carolinian to colonel gladden whom he knew only by reputation as colonel of the palmetto regiment in the mexican war and they drove him in his carriage comfortably to where he wanted to go a night drive of fifty miles for stephen for he had the return trip too i would rather live in siberia worse still in sahara than live in a country surrendered to yankees the carolinian says the conscription bill passed by congress is fatal to our liberties as a people let us be a people certain and sure as poor tom b said and then talk of rebelling against our home government sat up all night read eothen straight through our old wiley and putnam edition that we bought in london in 1845 how could i sleep the power they are bringing to bear against our country is tremendous its weight may be irresistible dare not think of that however april 21st have been ill one day i dined at mrs preston's pâté de foie gras and partridge prepared for me as i like them i had been awfully depressed for days and could not sleep at night for anxiety but i did not know that i was bodily ill mrs preston came home with me she said emphatically molly if your mistress is worse in the night send for me instantly i thought it very odd i could not breathe if i attempted to lie down and very soon i lost my voice molly raced out and sent lawrence for doctor trezevant she said i had the croup the doctor said congestion of the lungs so here i am stranded laid by the heels battle after battle has occurred disaster after disaster every morning's paper is enough to kill a well woman and age a strong and hearty one to day the waters of this stagnant pool were wildly stirred the president telegraphed for my husband to come on to richmond and offered him a place on his staff i was a joyful woman it was a way opened by providence from this slough of despond this council whose counsel no one takes i wrote to mr davis with thanks and begging your pardon how i would like to go mrs preston agrees with me mr chesnut ought to go through mr chesnut the president might hear many things to the advantage of our state etc letter from quinton washington that was the best tonic yet he writes so cheerfully we have fifty thousand men on the peninsula and mcclellan eighty thousand we expect that much disparity of numbers we can stand that april 23d on april 23 1840 i was married aged seventeen consequently on the 31st of march 1862 i was thirty nine i saw a wedding to day from my window which opens on trinity church nanna shand married a doctor wilson then a beautiful bevy of girls rushed into my room such a flutter and a chatter well thank heaven for a wedding it is a charming relief from the dismal litany of our daily song a letter to day from our octogenarian at mulberry his nephew jack deas had two horses shot under him the old colonel has his growl that's enough for glory and no hurt after all he ends however with his never failing refrain we can't fight all the world two and two only make four it can't make a thousand numbers will not lie he says he has lost half a million already in railroad bonds bank stock western notes of hand not to speak of negroes to be freed and lands to be confiscated for he takes the gloomiest views of all things april 26th doleful dumps alarm bells ringing telegrams say the mortar fleet has passed the forts at new orleans down into the very depths of despair are we april 27th new orleans gone1 and with it the confederacy that mississippi ruins us if lost the confederacy has been done to death by the politicians what wonder we are lost the soldiers have done their duty all honor to the army statesmen as busy as bees about their own places or their personal honor too busy to see the enemy at a distance with a microscope they were examining their own interests or their own wrongs forgetting the interests of the people they represented they were concocting newspaper paragraphs to injure the government no matter how vital it may be nothing can be kept from the enemy they must publish themselves night and day what they are doing or the omniscient buncombe will forget them this fall of new orleans means utter ruin to the private fortunes of the prestons mr preston came from new orleans so satisfied with mansfield lovell and the tremendous steam rams he saw there while in new orleans burnside offered mr preston five hundred thousand dollars a debt due to him from burnside and he refused to take it he said the money was safer in burnside's hands than his and so it may prove so ugly is the outlook now burnside is wide awake he is not a man to be caught napping mary preston was saying she had asked the hamptons how they relished the idea of being paupers if the country is saved none of us will care for that sort of thing philosophical and patriotic mr chesnut came in saying conrad has been telegraphed from new orleans that the great iron clad louisiana went down at the first shot mr chesnut and mary preston walked off first to the bulletin board and then to the prestons april 29th a grand smash the news from new orleans fatal to us met mr weston he wanted to know where he could find a place of safety for two hundred negroes i looked into his face to see if he were in earnest then to see if he were sane there was a certain set of two hundred negroes that had grown to be a nuisance apparently all the white men of the family had felt bound to stay at home to take care of them there are people who still believe negroes property like noah's neighbors who insisted that the deluge would only be a little shower after all these negroes however were plowden weston's a totally different part of speech he gave field rifles to one company and forty thousand dollars to another he is away with our army at corinth so i said you may rely upon mr chesnut who will assist you to his uttermost in finding a home for these people nothing belonging to that patriotic gentleman shall come to grief if we have to take charge of them on our own place mr chesnut did get a place for them as i said he would had to go to the governor's or they would think we had hoisted the black flag heard there we are going to be beaten as cortez beat the mexicans by superior arms mexican bows and arrows made a poor showing in the face of spanish accoutrements our enemies have such superior weapons of war we hardly any but what we capture from them in the fray the saxons and the normans were in the same plight war seems a game of chess but we have an unequal number of pawns to begin with we have knights kings queens bishops and castles enough but our skilful generals whenever they can not arrange the board to suit them exactly burn up everything and march away we want them to save the country they seem to think their whole duty is to destroy ships and save the army mr robert barnwell wrote that he had to hang his head for south carolina we had not furnished our quota of the new levy five thousand men to day colonel chesnut published his statement to show that we have sent thirteen thousand instead of the mere number required of us so mr barnwell can hold up his head again april 30th the last day of this month of calamities lovell left the women and children to be shelled and took the army to a safe place i do not understand why we do not send the women and children to the safe place and let the army stay where the fighting is to be armies are to save not to be saved at least to be saved is not their raison d'être exactly if this goes on the spirit of our people will be broken one ray of comfort comes from henry marshall our army of the peninsula is fine so good i do not think mcclellan will venture to attack it so mote it be
april 1st mrs davis is utterly depressed she said the fall of richmond must come she would send her children to me and mrs preston we begged her to come to us also my husband is as depressed as i ever knew him to be he has felt the death of that angel mother of his keenly and now he takes his country's woes to heart april 11th drove with mrs davis and all her infant family wonderfully clever and precocious children with unbroken wills at one time there was a sudden uprising of the nursery contingent they laughed fought and screamed bedlam broke loose mrs davis scolded laughed and cried she asked me if my husband would speak to the president about the plan in south carolina which everybody said suited him no mrs davis said i that is what i told mr davis said she colonel chesnut rides so high a horse now browne is so much more practical he goes forth to be general of conscripts in georgia his wife will stay at the cobbs's mrs ould gave me a luncheon on saturday i felt that this was my last sad farewell to richmond and the people there i love so well mrs davis sent her carriage for me and we went to the oulds together such good things were served oranges guava jelly etc the examiner says mr ould when he goes to fortress monroe replenishes his larder why not the examiner has taken another fling at the president as haughty and austere with his friends affable kind subservient to his enemies i wonder if the yankees would indorse that certificate both sides abuse him he can not please anybody it seems no doubt he is right my husband is now brigadier general and is sent to south carolina to organize and take command of the reserve troops c c clay and l q c lamar are both spoken of to fill the vacancy made among mr davis's aides by this promotion to day captain smith lee spent the morning here and gave a review of past washington gossip i am having such a busy happy life with so many friends and my friends are so clever so charming but the change to that weary dreary camden mary preston said i do think mrs chesnut deserves to be canonized she agrees to go back to camden the prestons gave me a farewell dinner my twenty fourth wedding day and the very pleasantest day i have spent in richmond maria lewis was sitting with us on mrs huger's steps and smith lee was lauding virginia people as usual as lee would say there hove in sight frank parker riding one of the finest of general bragg's horses by his side buck on fairfax the most beautiful horse in richmond his brown coat looking like satin his proud neck arched moving slowly gracefully calmly no fidgets aristocratic in his bearing to the tips of his bridle reins there sat buck tall and fair managing her horse with infinite ease her english riding habit showing plainly the exquisite proportions of her figure supremely lovely said smith lee look at them both said i proudly can you match those two in virginia three cheers for south carolina was the answer of lee the gallant virginia sailor
april 3d saw general preston ride off he came to tell me good by i told him he looked like a crusader on his great white horse with william his squire at his heels our men are all consummate riders and have their servants well mounted behind them carrying cloaks and traps how different from the same men packed like sardines in dirty railroad cars usually floating inch deep in liquid tobacco juice for the kitchen and ellen's comfort i wanted a pine table and a kitchen chair a woman sold me one to day for three thousand confederate dollars mrs hamilton has been disappointed again prioleau hamilton says the person into whose house they expected to move to day came to say she could not take boarders for three reasons first that they had smallpox in the house and the two others oh i did not ask for the two others april 5th miss middleton's letter came in answer to mine telling her how generous my friends here were to me we long she says for our own small sufficiency of wood corn and vegetables here is a struggle unto death although the neighbors continue to feed us as you would say with a spoon we have fallen upon a new device we keep a cookery book on the mantelpiece and when the dinner is deficient we just read off a pudding or a creme it does not entirely satisfy the appetite this dessert in imagination but perhaps it is as good for the digestion as i was ready to go though still up stairs some one came to say general hood had called mrs hamilton cried out send word you are not at home never said i why make him climb all these stairs when you must go in five minutes if he had come here dragging sherman as a captive at his chariot wheels i might say not at home but not now and i ran down and greeted him on the sidewalk in the face of all and walked slowly beside him as he toiled up the weary three stories limping gallantly he was so well dressed and so cordial not depressed in the slightest he was so glad to see me he calls his report self defense says joe johnston attacked him and he was obliged to state things from his point of view and now follow statements where one may read between the lines what one chooses he had been offered a command in western virginia but as general lee was concerned because he and joe johnston were not on cordial terms and as the fatigue of the mountain campaign would be too great for him he would like the chance of going across the mississippi texas was true to him and would be his home as it had voted him a ranch somewhere out there they say general lee is utterly despondent and has no plan if richmond goes as go it must april 7th richmond has fallen and i have no heart to write about it grant broke through our lines and sherman cut through them stoneman is this side of danville they are too many for us everything is lost in richmond even our archives blue black is our horizon hood says we shall all be obliged to go west to texas i mean for our own part of the country will be overrun yes a solitude and a wild waste it may become but as to that we can rough it in the bush at home de fontaine in his newspaper continues the old cry now richmond is given up he says it was too heavy a load to carry and we are stronger than ever stronger than ever nine tenths of our army are under ground and where is another army to come from will they wait until we grow one april 15th what a week it has been madness sadness anxiety turmoil ceaseless excitement the wigfalls passed through on their way to texas we did not see them louly told hood they were bound for the rio grande and intended to shake hands with maximilian emperor of mexico yankees were expected here every minute mrs davis came we went down to the cars at daylight to receive her she dined with me lovely winnie the baby came too buck and hood were here and that queen of women mary darby clay behaved like a trump he was as devoted to mrs davis in her adversity as if they had never quarreled in her prosperity people sent me things for mrs davis as they did in columbia for mr davis it was a luncheon or breakfast only she stayed for here mrs brown prepared a dinner for her at the station i went down with her she left here at five o'clock my heart was like lead but we did not give way she was as calm and smiling as ever it was but a brief glimpse of my dear mrs davis and under altered skies april 17th a letter from mrs davis who writes do come to me and see how we get on i shall have a spare room by the time you arrive indifferently furnished but oh so affectionately placed at your service you will receive such a loving welcome one perfect bliss have i the baby who grows fat and is smiling always is christened and not old enough to develop the world's vices or to be snubbed by it the name so long delayed is varina anne my name is a heritage of woe are you delighted with your husband i am delighted with him as well as with my own it is well to lose an arabian horse if one elicits such a tender and at the same time knightly letter as general chesnut wrote to my poor old prometheus i do not think that for a time he felt the vultures after the reception of the general's letter i hear horrid reports about richmond it is said that all below ninth street to the rocketts has been burned by the rabble who mobbed the town the yankee performances have not been chronicled may god take our cause into his own hands april 19th just now when mr clay dashed up stairs pale as a sheet saying general lee has capitulated i saw it reflected in mary darby's face before i heard him speak she staggered to the table sat down and wept aloud mr clay's eyes were not dry quite beside herself mary shrieked now we belong to negroes and yankees buck said i do not believe it how different from ours of them is their estimate of us how contradictory is their attitude toward us to keep the despised and iniquitous south within their borders as part of their country they are willing to enlist millions of men at home and abroad and to spend billions and we know they do not love fighting per se nor spending money they are perfectly willing to have three killed for our one we hear they have all grown rich through shoddy whatever that is genuine yankees can make a fortune trading jack knives somehow it is borne in on me that we will have to pay the piper was remarked to day no blood can not be squeezed from a turnip you can not pour anything out of an empty cup we have no money even for taxes or to be confiscated while the preston girls are here my dining room is given up to them and we camp on the landing with our one table and six chairs beds are made on the dining room floor otherwise there is no furniture except buckets of water and bath tubs in their improvised chamber night and day this landing and these steps are crowded with the élite of the confederacy going and coming and when night comes or rather bedtime more beds are made on the floor of the landing place for the war worn soldiers to rest upon the whole house is a bivouac as pickens said of south carolina in 1861 we are an armed camp my husband is rarely at home i sleep with the girls and my room is given up to soldiers general lee's few but undismayed his remnant of an army or the part from the south and west sad and crestfallen pass through chester many discomfited heroes find their way up these stairs they say johnston will not be caught as lee was he can retreat that is his trade if he would not fight sherman in the hill country of georgia what will he do but retreat in the plains of north carolina with grant sherman and thomas all to the fore we are to stay here running is useless now so we mean to bide a yankee raid which they say is imminent why fly they are everywhere these yankees like red ants like the locusts and frogs which were the plagues of egypt the plucky way in which our men keep up is beyond praise there is no howling and our poverty is made a matter of laughing we deride our own penury of the country we try not to speak at all april 22d this yellow confederate quire of paper my journal blotted by entries has been buried three days with the silver sugar dish teapot milk jug and a few spoons and forks that follow my fortunes as i wander with these valuables was hood's silver cup which was partly crushed when he was wounded at chickamauga it has been a wild three days with aides galloping around with messages yankees hanging over us like a sword of damocles we have been in queer straits we sat up at mrs bedon's dressed without once going to bed for forty eight hours and we were aweary colonel cadwallader jones came with a despatch a sealed secret despatch it was for general chesnut i opened it lincoln old abe lincoln has been killed murdered and seward wounded why by whom it is simply maddening all this i sent off messenger after messenger for general chesnut i have not the faintest idea where he is but i know this foul murder will bring upon us worse miseries mary darby says but they murdered him themselves no confederates are in washington but if they see fit to accuse us of instigating it who murdered him who knows see if they don't take vengeance on us now that we are ruined and can not repel them any longer the death of lincoln i call a warning to tyrants he will not be the last president put to death in the capital though he is the first buck never submits to be bored the bores came to tea at mrs bedon's and then sat and talked so prosy so wearisome was the discourse so endless it seemed that we envied buck who was mooning on the piazza she rarely speaks now a newspaper extra highly important news an armistice agreed upon lincoln assassinated and seward mortally wounded in washington greensboro april 19 1865 general order no 14 it is announced to the army that a suspension of arms has been agreed upon pending negotiations between the two governments during its continuance the two armies are to occupy their present position by command of general johnston signed archer anderson lieut col and a a g offficial copy isaac hayne washington april 12 1865 to major general sherman president lincoln was murdered about ten o'clock last night in his private box at ford's theatre in this city by an assassin who shot him in the head with a pistol ball at the same hour mr seward's house was entered by another assassin who stabbed the secretary in several places it is thought he may possibly recover but his son fred may possibly die of the wounds he received the assassin of the president leaped from the private box brandishing his dagger and exclaiming sic semper tyrannis virginia is revenged mr lincoln fell senseless from his seat and continued in that condition until 22 minutes past 10 o'clock this morning at which time he breathed his last vice president johnson now becomes president and will take the oath of office and assume the duties to day signed e m stanton to the citizens of chester chester s.c april 22 1865

the same at once e m graham agent subsistence dep't headquarters reserve forces s c chesterville april 20 1865 the brigadier general commanding has been informed that in view of the approach of the enemy a large quantity of supplies of various kinds were given out by the various government officers at this post to the citizens of the place he now calls upon and earnestly requests all citizens who may have such stores in their possession to return them to the several departments to which they belong the stores are much needed at this time for the use of soldiers passing through the place and for the sick at the hospital by command of brig gen chesnut m r clark major and a a general april 23d my silver wedding day and i am sure the unhappiest day of my life mr portman came with christopher hampton portman told of miss kate hampton who is perhaps the most thoroughly ladylike person in the world when he told her that lee had surrendered she started up from her seat and said that is a lie well miss hampton i tell the tale as it was told me i can do no more no wonder john chesnut is bitter they say mulberry has been destroyed by a corps commanded by general logan some one asked coolly will general chesnut be shot as a soldier or hung as a senator i am not of sufficient consequence answered he they will stop short of brigadiers i resigned my seat in the united states senate weeks before there was any secession so i can not be hung as a senator but after all it is only a choice between drumhead court martial short shrift and a lingering death at home from starvation these negroes are unchanged the shining black mask they wear does not show a ripple of change they are sphinxes ellen has had my diamonds to keep for a week or so when the danger was over she handed them back to me with as little apparent interest in the matter as if they had been garden peas mrs huger was in church in richmond when the news of the surrender came worshipers were in the midst of the communion service mr mcfarland was called out to send away the gold from his bank mr minnegerode's english grew confused then the president was summoned and distress of mind showed itself in every face the night before one of general lee's aides walter taylor was married and was off to the wars immediately after the ceremony one year ago we left richmond the confederacy has double quicked down hill since then one year since i stood in that beautiful hollywood by little joe davis's grave now we have burned towns deserted plantations sacked villages you seem resolute to look the worst in the face said general chesnut wearily yes poverty with no future and no hope but no slaves thank god cried buck we would be the scorn of the world if the world thought of us at all you see we are exiles and paupers pile on the agony how does our famous captain the great lee bear the yankees galling chain i asked he knows how to possess his soul in patience answered my husband if there were no such word as subjugation no debts no poverty no negro mobs backed by yankees if all things were well you would shiver and feel benumbed he went on pointing at me in an oratorical attitude your sentence is pronounced camden for life
may 9th virginia commissioners here mr staples and mr edmonston came to see me they say virginia has no grievance she comes out on a point of honor could she stand by and see her sovereign sister states invaded sumter anderson has been offered a kentucky regiment can they raise a regiment in kentucky against us in kentucky our sister state suddenly general beauregard and his aide the last left him of the galaxy who surrounded him in charleston john manning have gone heaven knows where but out on a war path certainly governor manning called himself the last rose of summer left blooming alone of that fancy staff a new fight will gather them again ben mcculloch the texas ranger is here and mr ward 1 my gutta percha friend's colleague from texas senator ward in appearance is the exact opposite of senator hemphill the latter with the face of an old man has the hair of a boy of twenty mr ward is fresh and fair with blue eyes and a boyish face but his head is white as snow whether he turned it white in a single night or by slower process i do not know but it is strangely out of keeping with his clear young eye he is thin and has a queer stooping figure this story he told me of his own experience on a western steamer there was a great crowd and no unoccupied berth or sleeping place of any sort whatsoever in the gentlemen's cabin saloon i think they called it he had taken a stateroom 110 but he could not eject the people who had already seized it and were asleep in it neither could the captain it would have been a case of revolver or leven inch bowie knife near the ladies saloon the steward took pity on him this man said he is 110 and i can find no place for him poor fellow there was a peep out of bright eyes i say steward have you a man 110 years old out there let us see him he must be a natural curiosity we are overcrowded was the answer and we can't find a place for him to sleep poor old soul bring him in here we will take care of him stoop and totter sniggered the steward to no 110 and go in ah said mr ward how those houris patted and pitied me and hustled me about and gave me the best berth i tried not to look i knew it was wrong but i looked i saw them undoing their back hair and was lost in amazement 1 matthias ward was a native of georgia but had removed to texas in 1836 he was twice a delegate to national democratic conventions and in 1858 was appointed to fill a vacancy from texas in the united states senate holding that office until 1860 at the collapse when the huge hoop skirts fell off unheeded on the cabin floor one beauty who was disporting herself near his curtain suddenly caught his eye she stooped and gathered up her belongings as she said i say stewardess your old hundred and ten is a humbug his eyes are too blue for anything and she fled as he shut himself in nearly frightened to death i forget how it ended there was so much laughing at his story i did not hear it all so much for hoary locks and their reverence inspiring power russell the wandering english newspaper correspondent was telling how very odd some of our plantation habits were he was staying at the house of an ex cabinet minister and madame would stand on the back piazza and send her voice three fields off calling a servant now that is not a southern peculiarity our women are soft and sweet low toned indolent graceful quiescent i dare say there are bawling squalling vulgar people everywhere may 13th we have been down from montgomery on the boat to that god forsaken landing portland ala found everybody drunk that is the three men who were there at last secured a carriage to carry us to my brother in law's house mr chesnut had to drive seven miles pitch dark over an unknown road my heart was in my mouth which last i did not open next day a patriotic person informed us that so great was the war fever only six men could be found in dallas county i whispered to mr chesnut we found three of the lone ones hors de combat at portland so much for the corps of reserves alcoholized patriots saw for the first time the demoralization produced by hopes of freedom my mother's butler whom i taught to read sitting on his knife board contrived to keep from speaking to us he was as efficient as ever in his proper place but he did not come behind the scenes as usual and have a friendly chat held himself aloof so grand and stately we had to send him a tip through his wife hetty mother's maid who however showed no signs of disaffection she came to my bedside next morning with everything that was nice for breakfast she had let me sleep till midday and embraced me over and over again i remarked what a capital cook they have here she curtsied to the ground i cooked every mouthful on that tray as if i did not know what you liked to eat since you was a baby may 19th mrs fitzpatrick says mr davis is too gloomy for her he says we must prepare for a long war and unmerciful reverses at first because they are readier for war and so much stronger numerically men and money count so in war as they do everywhere else said i doubting her accurate account of mr davis's spoken words though she tried to give them faithfully we need patience and persistence there is enough and to spare of pluck and dash among us the do and dare style i drove out with mrs davis she finds playing mrs president of this small confederacy slow work after leaving friends such as mrs emory and mrs joe johnston1 in washington i do not blame her the wrench has been awful with us all but we don't mean to be turned into pillars of salt mr mallory came for us to go to mrs toombs's reception mr chesnut would not go and i decided to remain with him this proved a wise decision first mr hunter2 1 mrs johnston was lydia mclane a daughter of louis mclane united states senator from delaware from 1827 to 1829 and afterward minister to england in 1831 he became secretary of the treasury and in 1833 secretary of state general joseph e johnston was graduated from west point in 1829 and had served in the black hawk seminole and mexican wars he resigned his commission in the united states army on april 22 1861 2 mr hunter was a virginian he had long served in congress was twice speaker of the house and in 1844 was elected a united states senator serving until 1861 he supported slavery and became active in the secession movement at the charleston convention in 1860 he received the next highest vote to stephen a douglas for president came in college they called him from his initials r m t run mad tom hunter just now i think he is the sanest if not the wisest man in our new born confederacy i remember when i first met him he sat next to me at some state dinner in washington mr clay had taken me in to dinner but seemed quite satisfied that my other side should take me off his hands mr hunter did not know me nor i him i suppose he inquired or looked at my card lying on the table as i looked at his at any rate we began a conversation which lasted steadily through the whole thing from soup to dessert mr hunter though in evening dress presented a rather tumbled up appearance his waistcoat wanted pulling down and his hair wanted brushing he delivered unconsciously that day a lecture on english literature which if printed i still think would be a valuable addition to that literature since then i have always looked forward to a talk with the senator from virginia with undisguised pleasure next came mr miles and mr jameson of south carolina the latter was president of our secession convention also has written a life of du guesclin that is not so bad so my unexpected reception was of the most charming judge frost came a little later they all remained until the return of the crowd from mrs toombs's these men are not sanguine i can't say without hope exactly they are agreed in one thing it is worth while to try a while if only to get away from new england captain ingraham was here too he is south carolina to the tips of his fingers yet he has it dyed in the wool it is part of his nature to believe the united states navy can whip anything in the world all of these little inconsistencies and contrarieties make the times very exciting one never knows what tack any one of them will take at the next word may 20th lunched at mrs davis's everything nice to eat and i was ravenous for a fortnight i have not even gone to the dinner table yesterday i was forced to dine on cold asparagus and blackberries so repulsive in aspect was the other food they sent me mrs davis was as nice as the luncheon when she is in the mood i do not know so pleasant a person she is awfully clever always we talked of this move from montgomery mr chesnut opposes it violently because this is so central a position for our government he wants our troops sent into maryland in order to make our fight on the border and so to encompass washington i see that the uncomfortable hotels here will at last move the congress our statesmen love their ease and it will be hot here in summer i do hope they will go mrs davis said the yankees will make it hot for us go where we will and truly so if war comes and it has come said i yes i fancy these dainty folks may live to regret losing even the fare of the montgomery hotels never mr chesnut has three distinct manias the maryland scheme is one and he rushes off to jeff davis who i dare say has fifty men every day come to him with infallible plans to save the country if only he can keep his temper mrs davis says he answers all advisers in softly modulated dulcet accents what a rough menagerie we have here and if nice people come to see you up walks an irate judge who engrosses the conversation and abuses the friends of the company generally that is abuses everybody and prophesies every possible evil to the country provided he finds that denouncing your friends does not sufficiently depress you everybody has manias up north too by the papers but of mr chesnut's three crazes maryland is to be made the seat of war old morrow's idea of buying up steamers abroad for our coast defenses should be adopted and last of all but far from the least we must make much cotton and send it to england as a bank to draw on the very cotton we have now if sent across the water would be a gold mine to us may 25,1861 we have come back to south carolina from the montgomery congress stopping over at mulberry we came with r m t hunter and mr barnwell mr barnwell has excellent reasons for keeping cotton at home but i forget what they are generally people take what he says also mr hunter's wisdom as unanswerable not so mr chesnut who growls at both much as he likes them we also had tom lang and his wife and doctor boykin surely there never was a more congenial party the younger men had been in the south carolina college while mr barnwell was president their love and respect for him were immeasurable and he benignly received it smiling behind those spectacles met john darby at atlanta and told him he was surgeon of the hampton legion which delighted him he had had adventures with only a few moments on the platform to interchange confidences he said he had remained a little too long in the medical college in philadelphia where he was some kind of a professor and they had been within an ace of hanging him as a southern spy rope was ready he sniggered at atlanta when he unguardedly said he was fresh from philadelphia he barely escaped lynching being taken for a northern spy lively life i am having among you on both sides he said hurrying away and i moaned here was john darby like to have been killed by both sides and no time to tell me the curious coincidences what marvelous experiences a little war begins to produce may 27th they look for a fight at norfolk beauregard is there i think if i were a man i'd be there too also harper's ferry is to be attacked the confederate flag has been cut down at alexandria by a man named ellsworth 1 who was in command of zouaves jackson was the name of the person who shot ellsworth in the act sixty of our cavalry have been taken by sherman's brigade deeper and deeper we go in thirty of tom boykin's company have come home from richmond they went as a rifle company armed with muskets they were sandhill tackeys those fastidious ones not very anxious to fight with anything or in any way i fancy richmond ladies had come for them in carriages feted them waved handkerchiefs to them brought them dainties with their own hands in the faith that every carolinian was a gentleman and every man south of mason and dixon's line a hero but these are not exactly descendants of the scotch hay who fought the danes with his plowshare or the oxen's yoke or something that could hit hard and that came handy johnny has gone as a private in gregg's regiment he could not stand it at home any longer mr chesnut was willing for him to go because those sandhill men said this was a rich man's war and the rich men would be the officers and have an easy time and the poor ones would 1 ephraim elmer ellsworth was a native of saratoga county new york in 1860 he organized a regiment of zouaves and became its colonel he accompanied lincoln to washington in 1861 and was soon sent with his regiment to alexandria where on seeing a confederate flag floating from a hotel he personally rushed to the roof and tore it down the owner of the hotel a man named jackson met him as he was descending and shot him dead frank e brownell one of ellsworth's men then killed jackson be privates so he said let the gentlemen set the example let them go in the ranks so john chesnut is a gentleman private he took his servant with him all the same johnny reproved me for saying if i were a man i would not sit here and dole and drink and drivel and forget the fight going on in virginia he said it was my duty not to talk so rashly and make enemies he had the money in his pocket to raise a company last fall but it has slipped through his fingers and now he is a common soldier you wasted it or spent it foolishly said i i do not know where it has gone said he there was too much consulting over me too much good counsel was given to me and everybody gave me different advice don't you ever know your own mind we will do very well in the ranks men and officers all alike we know everybody so i repeated mrs lowndes's solemn words when she heard that south carolina had seceded alone as thy days so shall thy strength be don't know exactly what i meant but thought i must be impressive as he was going away saw him off at the train forgot to say anything there but cried my eyes out sent mrs wigfall a telegram where shrieks the wild sea mew she answered sea mew at the spotswood hotel will shriek soon i will remain here
may 6th mine is a painful self imposed task but why write when i have nothing to chronicle but disaster 1 so i read instead first consuelo then columba two ends of the pole certainly and then a translated edition of elective affinities food enough for thought in every one of this odd assortment of books at the prestons where i am staying because mr chesnut has gone to see his crabbed old father whom he loves and who is reported ill i met christopher hampton he tells us wigfall is out on a warpath wants them to strike for maryland the president's opinion of the move is not given also mr hampton met the first lieutenant of the kirkwoods e m boykin says he is just the same man he was in the south carolina college in whatever company you may meet him he is the pleasantest man there a telegram reads we have repulsed the enemy at williamsburg 1 oh if we could drive them back to their ain countree richmond was hard pressed this day the mercury of to day says jeff davis now treats all men as if they were idiotic insects mary preston said all sisters quarreled no we never quarrel i and mine we keep all our bitter words for our enemies we are frank heathens we hate our enemies and love our friends some people our kind can never make up after a quarrel hard words once only and all is over to us forgiveness is impossible forgiveness means calm indifference philosophy while love lasts forgiveness of love's wrongs is impossible those dutiful wives who piously overlook well everything do not care one fig for their husbands i settled that in my own mind years ago some people think it magnanimous to praise their enemies and to show their impartiality and justice by acknowledging the faults of their friends i am for the simple rule the good old plan i praise whom i love and abuse whom i hate mary preston has been translating schiller aloud we are provided with bulwer's translation mrs austin's coleridge's and carlyle's and we show how each renders the passage mary is to convert into english in wallenstein at one point of the max and thekla scene i like carlyle better than coleridge though they say coleridge's wallenstein is the only translation in the world half so good as the original mrs barstow repeated some beautiful scraps by uhland which i had never heard before she is to write them for us peace and a literary leisure for my old age unbroken by care and anxiety general preston accused me of degenerating into a boarding house gossip and is answered triumphantly by his daughters but papa one you love to gossip with full well hampton estate has fifteen hundred negroes on lake washington mississippi hampton girls talking in the language of james's novels neither wade nor preston that splendid boy would lay a lance in rest or couch it which is the right phrase for fighting to preserve slavery they hate it as we do what are they fighting for southern rights whatever that is and they do not want to be understrappers forever to the yankees they talk well enough about it but i forget what they say johnny chesnut says no use to give a reason a fellow could not stay away from the fight not well it takes four negroes to wait on johnny satisfactorily it is this giving up that kills me norfolk they talk of now why not charleston next i read in a western letter not beauregard but the soldiers who stopped to drink the whisky they had captured from the enemy lost us shiloh cock robin is as dead as he ever will be now what matters it who killed him may 12th mr chesnut says he is very glad he went to town everything in charleston is so much more satisfactory than it is reported troops are in good spirits it will take a lot of iron clads to take that city isaac hayne said at dinner yesterday that both beauregard and the president had a great opinion of mr chesnut's natural ability for strategy and military evolution hon mr barnwell concurred that is mr barnwell had been told so by the president then why did not the president offer me something better than an aideship i heard he offered to make you a general last year and you said you could not go over other men's shoulders until you had earned promotion you are too hard to please no not exactly that i was only offered a colonelcy and mr barnwell persuaded me to stick to the senate then he wanted my place and between the two stools i fell to the ground my molly will forget lige and her babies too i asked her who sent me that beautiful bouquet i found on my center table i give it to you twas give to me and molly was all wriggle giggle blush may 18th norfolk has been burned and the merrimac sunk without striking a blow since her coup d'état in hampton roads read milton see the speech of adam to eve in a new light women will not stay at home will go out to see and be seen even if it be by the devil himself very encouraging letters from hon mr memminger and from l q washington they tell the same story in very different words it amounts to this not one foot of virginia soil is to be given up without a bitter fight for it we have one hundred and five thousand men in all mcclellan one hundred and ninety thousand we can stand that disparity what things i have been said to have said mr heard me make scoffing remarks about the governor and the council or he thinks he heard me james chesnut wrote him a note that my name was to be kept out of it indeed that he was never to mention my name again under any possible circumstances it was all preposterous nonsense but it annoyed my husband amazingly he said it was a scheme to use my chatter to his injury he was very kind about it he knows my real style so well that he can always tell my real impudence from what is fabricated for me there is said to be an order from butler1 turning over the women of new orleans to his soldiers thus is the measure of his iniquities filled we thought that generals always restrained by shot or sword if need be the brutality of soldiers this hideous cross eyed beast orders his men to treat the ladies of new orleans as women of the town to punish them he says for their insolence footprints on the boundaries of another world once more willie taylor before he left home for the army fancied one day day remember that he saw albert rhett standing by his side he recoiled from the ghostly presence you need not do that willie you will soon be as i am willie rushed into the next room to tell them what had happened and fainted it had a very depressing effect upon him and now the other day he died in virginia may 24th the enemy are landing at georgetown with a little more audacity where could they not land but we have given them such a scare they are cautious if it be true i hope some cool headed white men will make the negroes save the rice for us it is so much needed they say it might have been done at port royal with a little more energy south carolinians have pluck enough but they only work by fits and starts there is no continuous effort they can't be counted on for steady work they will stop to play or enjoy life in some shape without let or hindrance halleck is being reenforced beauregard unmolested was making some fine speeches and issuing proclamations while we were fatuously looking for him to make a tiger's spring on huntsville why not hope springs eternal in the southern breast my hebrew friend mem cohen has a son in the war he is in john chesnut's company cohen is a high name among the jews it means aaron she has long fits of silence and is absent minded if she is suddenly roused she is apt to say with overflowing eyes and clasped hands if it please god to spare his life her daughter is the sweetest little thing the son is the mother's idol mrs cohen was miriam de leon i have known her intimately all my life mrs bartow the widow of colonel bartow who was killed at manassas was miss berrien daughter of judge berrien of georgia she is now in one of the departments here cutting bonds confederate bonds for five hundred confederate dollars a year a penniless woman judge carroll her brother in law has been urgent with her to come and live in his home he has a large family and she will not be an added burden to him in spite of all he can say she will not forego her resolution she will be independent she is a resolute little woman with the softest silkiest voice and ways and clever to the last point columbia is the place for good living pleasant people pleasant dinners pleasant drives i feel that i have put the dinners in the wrong place they are the climax of the good things here this is the most hospitable place in the world and the dinners are worthy of it in washington there was an endless succession of state dinners i was kindly used i do not remember ever being condemned to two dull neighbors on one side or the other was a clever man so i liked washington dinners in montgomery there were a few dinners mrs pollard's for instance but the society was not smoothed down or in shape such as it was it was given over to balls and suppers in charleston mr chesnut went to gentlemen's dinners all the time no ladies present flowers were sent to me and i was taken to drive and asked to tea there could not have been nicer suppers more perfect of their kind than were to be found at the winding up of those festivities in richmond there were balls which i did not attend very few to which i was asked the macfarlands and lyons's all i can remember james chesnut dined out nearly every day but then the breakfasts the virginia breakfasts where were always pleasant people indeed i have had a good time everywhere always clever people and people i liked and everybody so good to me here in columbia family dinners are the specialty you call or they pick you up and drive home with you oh stay to dinner and you stay gladly they send for your husband and he comes willingly then comes a perfect dinner you do not see how it could be improved and yet they have not had time to alter things or add because of the unexpected guests they have everything of the best silver glass china table linen and damask etc and then the planters live within themselves as they call it from the plantations come mutton beef poultry cream butter eggs fruits and vegetables it is easy to live here with a cook who has been sent for training to the best eating house in charleston old mrs chesnut's romeo was apprenticed at jones's i do not know where mrs preston's got his degree but he deserves a medal at the prestons james chesnut induced buck to declaim something about joan of arc which she does in a manner to touch all hearts while she was speaking my husband turned to a young gentleman who was listening to the chatter of several girls and said écoutez the youth stared at him a moment in bewilderment then gravely rose and began turning down the gas isabella said écoutez then means put out the lights i recall a scene which took place during a ball given by mrs preston while her husband was in louisiana mrs preston was resplendent in diamonds point lace and velvet there is a gentle dignity about her which is very attractive her voice is low and sweet and her will is iron she is exceedingly well informed but very quiet retiring and reserved indeed her apparent gentleness almost amounts to timidity she has chiseled regularity of features a majestic figure perfectly molded governor manning said to me look at sister caroline does she look as if she had the pluck of a heroine then he related how a little while ago william the butler came to tell her that john the footman was drunk in the cellar mad with drink that he had a carving knife which he was brandishing in drunken fury and he was keeping everybody from their business threatening to kill any one who dared to go into the basement they were like a flock of frightened sheep down there she did not speak to one of us but followed william down to the basement holding up her skirts she found the servants scurrying everywhere screaming and shouting that john was crazy and going to kill them john was bellowing like a bull of bashan knife in hand chasing them at his pleasure mrs preston walked up to him give me that knife she demanded he handed it to her she laid it on the table now come with me she said putting her hand on his collar she led him away to the empty smoke house and there she locked him in and put the key in her pocket then she returned to her guests without a ripple on her placid face she told me of it smiling and serene as you see her now the governor concluded before the war shut him in general preston sent to the lakes for his salmon to mississippi for his venison to the mountains for his mutton and grouse it is good enough the best dish at all these houses what the spanish call the hearty welcome thackeray says at every american table he was first served with grilled hostess at the head of the table sat a person fiery faced anxious nervous inwardly murmuring like falstaff would it were night hal and all were well at mulberry the house is always filled to overflowing and one day is curiously like another people are coming and going carriages driving up or driving off it has the air of a watering place where one does not pay and where there are no strangers at christmas the china closet gives up its treasures the glass china silver fine linen reserved for grand occasions come forth as for the dinner itself it is only a matter of greater quantity more turkey more mutton more partridges more fish etc and more solemn stiffness usually a half dozen persons unexpectedly dropping in make no difference the family let the housekeeper know that is all people are beginning to come here from richmond one swallow does not make a summer but it shows how the wind blows these straws do mrs constitution browne and mrs wise the gibsons are at doctor gibbes's it does look squally we are drifting on the breakers may 29th betsey recalcitrant maid of the w s has been sold to a telegraph man she is as handsome as a mulatto ever gets to be and clever in every kind of work my molly thinks her mistress very lucky in getting rid of her she was a dangerous inmate but she will be a good cook a good chambermaid a good dairymaid a beautiful clear starcher and the most thoroughly good for nothing woman i know to her new owners if she chooses molly evidently hates her but thinks it her duty to stand by her color mrs gibson is a philadelphia woman she is true to her husband and children but she does not believe in us the confederacy i mean she is despondent and hopeless as wanting in faith of our ultimate success as is sally baxter hampton i make allowances for those people if i had married north they would have a heavy handful in me just now up there mrs chesnut my mother in law has been sixty years in the south and she has not changed in feeling or in taste one iota she can not like hominy for breakfast or rice for dinner without a relish to give it some flavor she can not eat watermelons and sweet potatoes sans discrétion as we do she will not eat hot corn bread à discrétion and hot buttered biscuit without any richmond is obliged to fall sighed mrs gibson you would say so too if you had seen our poor soldiers poor soldiers said i are you talking of stonewall jackson's men poor soldiers indeed she said her mind was fixed on one point and had ever been though she married and came south she never would own slaves who would that was not born to it i cried more excited than ever she is very handsome very clever and has very agreeable manners dear madam she says with tears in her beautiful eyes they have three armies but stonewall has routed one of them already heath another she only answered by an unbelieving moan nothing seemed to suit her i said as we went away you did not certainly said some one to me you contradicted every word she said with a sort of indignant protest we met mrs hampton gibbes at the door another virginia woman as good as gold they told us mrs davis was delightfully situated at raleigh north carolinians so loyal so hospitable she had not been allowed to eat a meal at the hotel how different from columbia said doctor gibbes looking at mrs gibson who has no doubt been left to take all of her meals at his house oh no cried mary you do columbia injustice mrs chesnut used to tell us that she was never once turned over to the tender mercies of the congaree cuisine and at mcmahan's it is fruit flowers invitations to dinner every day after we came away why did you not back me up i was asked why did you let them slander columbia it was awfully awkward i said but you see it would have been worse to let doctor gibbes and mrs gibson see how different it was with other people took a moonlight walk after tea at the halcott greens all the company did honor to the beautiful night by walking home with me uncle hamilton boykin is here staying at the de saussures he says manassas was play to williamsburg and he was at both battles he lead a part of stuart's cavalry in the charge at williamsburg riding a hundred yards ahead of his company toombs is ready for another revolution and curses freely everything confederate from the president down to a horse boy he thinks there is a conspiracy against him in the army why heavens and earth why
camden s c may 8 1864 my friends crowded around me so in those last days in richmond i forgot the affairs of this nation utterly though i did show faith in my confederate country by buying poor bones's my english maid's confederate bonds i gave her gold thimbles bracelets whatever was gold and would sell in new york or london i gave my friends in richmond grieved that i had to leave them not half so much however as i did that i must come away those last weeks were so pleasant no battle no murder no sudden death all went merry as a marriage bell clever cordial kind brave friends rallied around me maggie howell and i went down the river to see an exchange of prisoners our party were the lees mallorys mrs buck allan mrs ould we picked up judge ould and buck allan at curl's neck i had seen no genuine yankees before prisoners well or wounded had been german scotch or irish among our men coming ashore was an officer who had charge of some letters for a friend of mine whose fiancé had died i gave him her address one other man showed me some wonderfully ingenious things he had made while a prisoner one said they gave him rations for a week he always devoured them in three days he could not help it and then he had to bear the inevitable agony of those four remaining days many were wounded some were maimed for life they were very cheerful we had supper or some nondescript meal with ice cream on board the band played home sweet home one man tapped another on the shoulder well how do you feel old fellow never was so near crying in my life for very comfort governor cummings a georgian late governor of utah was among the returned prisoners he had been in prison two years his wife was with him he was a striking looking person huge in size and with snow white hair fat as a prize ox with no sign of yankee barbarity or starvation about him that evening as we walked up to mrs davis's carriage which was waiting for us at the landing dr garnett with maggie howell major hall with me suddenly i heard her scream and some one stepped back in the dark and said in a whisper little joe he has killed himself i felt reeling faint bewildered a chattering woman clutched my arm mrs davis's son impossible whom did you say was he an interesting child how old was he the shock was terrible and unnerved as i was i cried for god's sake take her away then maggie and i drove two long miles in silence except for maggie's hysterical sobs she was wild with terror the news was broken to her in that abrupt way at the carriage door so that at first she thought it had all happened there and that poor little joe was in the carriage mr burton harrison met us at the door of the executive mansion mrs semmes and mrs barksdale were there too every window and door of the house seemed wide open and the wind was blowing the curtains it was lighted even in the third story as i sat in the drawing room i could hear the tramp of mr davis's step as he walked up and down the room above not another sound the whole house as silent as death it was then twelve o'clock so i went home and waked general chesnut who had gone to bed we went immediately back to the president's found mrs semmes still there but saw no one but her we thought some friends of the family ought to be in the house mrs semmes said when she got there that little jeff was kneeling down by his brother and he called out to her in great distress mrs semmes i have said all the prayers i know how but god will not wake joe poor little joe the good child of the family was so gentle and affectionate he used to run in to say his prayers at his father's knee now he was laid out somewhere above us crushed and killed mrs semmes describing the accident said he fell from the high north piazza upon a brick pavement before i left the house i saw him lying there white and beautiful as an angel covered with flowers catherine his nurse flat on the floor by his side was weeping and wailing as only an irishwoman can immense crowds came to the funeral everybody sympathetic but some shoving and pushing rudely there were thousands of children and each child had a green bough or a bunch of flowers to throw on little joe's grave which was already a mass of white flowers crosses and evergreens the morning i came away from mrs davis's early as it was i met a little child with a handful of snow drops put these on little joe she said i knew him so well and then she turned and fled without another word i did not know who she was then or now as i walked home i met mr reagan then wade hampton but i could see nothing but little joe and his brokenhearted mother and mr davis's step still sounded in my ears as he walked that floor the livelong night general lee was to have a grand review the very day we left richmond great numbers of people were to go up by rail to see it miss turner mcfarland writes they did go but they came back faster than they went they found the army drawn up in battle array many of the brave and gay spirits that we saw so lately have taken flight the only flight they know and their bodies are left dead upon the battle field poor old edward johnston is wounded again and a prisoner jones's brigade broke first he was wounded the day before at wilmington we met general whiting he sent us to the station in his carriage and bestowed upon us a bottle of brandy which had run the blockade they say beauregard has taken his sword from whiting never i will not believe it at the capture of fort sumter they said whiting was the brains beauregard only the hand lucifer son of the morning how art thou fallen that they should even say such a thing my husband and mr covey got out at florence to procure for mrs miles a cup of coffee they were slow about it and they got left i did not mind this so very much for i remembered that we were to remain all day at kingsville and that my husband could overtake me there by the next train my maid belonged to the prestons she was only traveling home with me and would go straight on to columbia so without fear i stepped off at kingsville my old confederate silk like most confederate dresses had seen better days and i noticed that like oliver wendell holmes's famous one hoss stray it had gone to pieces suddenly and all over it was literally in strips i became painfully aware of my forlorn aspect when i asked the telegraph man the way to the hotel and he was by no means respectful to me i was indeed alone an old and not too respectable looking woman it was my first appearance in the character and i laughed aloud a very haughty and highly painted dame greeted me at the hotel no room said she who are you i gave my name try something else said she mrs chesnut don't travel round by herself with no servants and no nothing i looked down there i was dirty tired tattered and torn where do you come from said she my home is in camden come now i know everybody in camden i sat down meekly on a bench in the piazza that was free to all wayfarers which mrs chesnut said she sharply i know both i am now the only one and now what is the matter with you do you take me for a spy i know you perfectly well i went to school with you at miss henrietta de leon's and my name was mary miller the lord sakes alive and to think you are her now i see dear dear me heaven sakes woman but you are broke and tore i added holding up my dress but i had had no idea it was so difficult to effect an entry into a railroad wayside hotel i picked up a long strip of my old black dress torn off by a man's spur as i passed him getting off the train it is sad enough at mulberry without old mrs chesnut who was the good genius of the place it is so lovely here in spring the giants of the forest the primeval oaks water oaks live oaks willow oaks such as i have not seen since i left here with opopanax violets roses and yellow jessamine the air is laden with perfume araby the blest was never sweeter inside are creature comforts of all kinds green peas strawberries asparagus spring lamb spring chicken fresh eggs rich yellow butter clean white linen for one's beds dazzling white damask for one's table it is such a contrast to richmond where i wish i were fighting is going on hampton is frantic for his laggard new regiments fall in slowly no fault of the soldiers they are as disgusted as he is bragg bragg the head of the war office can not organize in time john boykin has died in a yankee prison he had on a heavy flannel shirt when lying in an open platform car on the way to a cold prison on the lakes a federal soldier wanted john's shirt prisoners have no rights so john had to strip off and hand his shirt to him that caused his death in two days he was dead of pneumonia may be frozen to death one man said they are taking us there to freeze but then their men will find our hot sun in august and july as deadly as our men find their cold decembers their snow and ice finish our prisoners at a rapid rate they say napoleon's soldiers found out all that in the russian campaign have brought my houseless homeless friends refugees here to luxuriate in mulberry's plenty i can but remember the lavish kindness of the virginia people when i was there and in a similar condition the virginia people do the rarest acts of hospitality and never seem to know it is not in the ordinary course of events the president's man stephen bringing his master's arabian to mulberry for safe keeping said why missis your niggers down here are well off i call this mulberry place heaven with plenty to eat little to do warm house to sleep in a good church john l miller my cousin has been killed at the head of his regiment the blows now fall so fast on our heads they are bewildering the secretary of war authorizes general chesnut to reorganize the men who have been hitherto detailed for special duty and also those who have been exempt he says general chesnut originated the plan and organized the corps of clerks which saved richmond in the dahlgren raid may 27th in all this beautiful sunshine in the stillness and shade of these long hours on this piazza all comes back to me about little joe it haunts me that scene in richmond where all seemed confusion madness a bad dream here i see that funeral procession as it wound among those tall white monuments up that hillside the james river tumbling about below over rocks and around islands the dominant figure that poor old gray haired man standing bareheaded straight as an arrow clear against the sky by the open grave of his son she the bereft mother stood back in her heavy black wrappings and her tall figure drooped the flowers the children the procession as it moved comes and goes but those two dark sorrow stricken figures stand they are before me now that night with no sound but the heavy tramp of his feet overhead the curtains flapping in the wind the gas flaring i was numb stupid half dead with grief and terror then came catherine's irish howl cheap was that where was she when it all happened her place was to have been with the child who saw him fall whom will they kill next of that devoted household read to day the list of killed and wounded 1 one long column was not enough for south carolina's dead i see mr federal secretary stanton says he can reenforce suwarrow grant at his leisure whenever he calls for more he has just sent him 25,000 veterans old lincoln says in his quaint backwoods way keep a peggin now we can only peg out what have we left of men etc to meet these reenforcements as often as reenforcements are called for our fighting men have all gone to the front only old men and little boys are at home now it is impossible to sleep here because it is so solemn and still the moonlight shines in my window sad and white and the soft south wind literally comes over a bank of violets lilacs roses with orange blossoms and magnolia flowers mrs chesnut was only a year younger than her husband he is ninety two or three she was deaf but he retains his senses wonderfully for his great age i have always been an early riser formerly i often saw him sauntering slowly down the broad passage from his room to hers in a flowing flannel dressing gown when it was winter in the spring he was apt to be in shirt sleeves with suspenders hanging down his back he had always a large hair brush in his hand he would take his stand on the rug before the fire in her room brushing scant locks which were fleecy white her maid would be doing hers which were dead leaf brown not a white hair in her head he had the voice of a stentor and there he stood roaring his morning compliments the people who occupied the room above said he fairly shook the window glasses this pleasant morning greeting ceremony was never omitted her voice was soft and low the oft quoted philadelphia seems to have lost the art of sending forth such voices now mrs binney old mrs chesnut's sister came among us with the same softly modulated womanly musical voice her clever and beautiful daughters were criard judge han said philadelphia women scream like macaws this morning as i passed mrs chesnut's room the door stood wide open and i heard a pitiful sound the old man was kneeling by her empty bedside sobbing bitterly i fled down the middle walk anywhere out of reach of what was never meant for me to hear
june 6th davin have had a talk concerning him to day with two opposite extremes of people mrs chesnut my mother in law praises everybody good and bad judge not she says she is a philosopher she would not give herself the pain to find fault the judge abuses everybody and he does it so well short sharp and incisive are his sentences and he revels in condemning the world en bloc as the french say so nobody is the better for her good word or the worse for his bad one in camden i found myself in a flurry of women traitors they cried spies they ought to be hanged davin is taken up dean and davis are his accomplices what has davin done he'll be hanged never you mind for what they caught him walking on the trestle work in the swamp after no good you may be sure they won't hang him for that hanging is too good for him you wait till colonel chesnut comes he is a lawyer i said gravely ladies he will disappoint you there will be no lynching if he goes to that meeting to day he will not move a step except by habeas corpus and trial by jury and a quantity of bench and bar to speak long speeches mr chesnut did come and gave a more definite account of poor davin's precarious situation they had intercepted treasonable letters of his at the post office i believe it was not a very black treason after all at any rate mr chesnut spoke for him with might and main at the meeting it was composed the meeting of intelligent men with cool heads and they banished davin to fort sumter the poor music master can't do much harm in the casemates there he may thank his stars that mr chesnut gave him a helping hand in the red hot state our public mind now is in there will be a short shrift for spies judge withers said that mr chesnut never made a more telling speech in his life than he did to save this poor frenchman for whom judge lynch was ready i had never heard of davin in my life until i heard he was to be hanged judge stephen a douglas the little giant is dead one of those killed by the war no doubt trouble of mind charleston people are thin skinned they shrink from russell's touches i find his criticisms mild he has a light touch i expected so much worse those englishmen come somebody says with three p's pen paper prejudices i dread some of those after dinner stories as to that day in the harbor he let us off easily he says our men are so fine looking who denies it not one of us also that it is a silly impression which has gone abroad that men can not work in this climate we live in the open air and work like trojans at all manly sports riding hard hunting playing at being soldiers these fine manly specimens have been in the habit of leaving the coast when it became too hot there and also of fighting a duel or two if kept long sweltering under a charleston sun handsome youths whose size and muscle he admired so much as they prowled around the mills house would not relish hard work in the fields between may and december negroes stand a tropical or semitropical sun at noon day better than white men in fighting it is different men will not then mind sun or rain or wind major emory 1 when he was ordered west placed his resignation in the hands of his maryland brothers after the baltimore row the brothers sent it in but maryland declined to secede mrs emory who at least is two thirds of that copartnership being old franklin's granddaughter and true to her blood tried to get it back the president refused point blank though she went on her knees that i do not believe the franklin race are stiff necked and stiff kneed not much given to kneeling to god or man from all accounts if major emory comes to us won't he have a good time mrs davis adores mrs emory no wonder i fell in love with her myself i heard of her before i saw her in 1 william h emory had served in charleston harbor during the nullification troubles of 1831 1836 in 1846 he went to california afterward served in the mexican war and later assisted in running the boundary line between mexico and the united states under the gadsden treaty of 1853 in 1854 he was in kansas and in 1858 in utah after resigning his commission as related by the author he was reappointed a lieutenant colonel in the united states army and took an active part in the war on the side of the north this wise little banks told me the story she was dancing at a ball when some bad accident maker for the evening news rushed up and informed her that major emory had been massacred by ten indians somewhere out west she coolly answered him that she had later intelligence it was not so turning a deaf ear then she went on dancing next night the same officious fool met her with this congratulation oh mrs emory it was all a hoax the major is alive she cried you are always running about with your bad news and turned her back on him or i think it was you delight in spiteful stories or you are a harbinger of evil banks is a newspaper man and knows how to arrange an anecdote for effect june 12th have been looking at mrs o'dowd as she burnished the meejor's arrms before waterloo and i have been busy too my husband has gone to join beauregard somewhere beyond richmond i feel blue black with melancholy but i hope to be in richmond before long myself that is some comfort the war is making us all tenderly sentimental no casualties yet no real mourning nobody hurt so it is all parade fife and fine feathers posing we are en grande tenue there is no imagination here to forestall woe and only the excitement and wild awakening from every day stagnant life are felt that is when one gets away from the two or three sensible men who are still left in the world when beauregard's report of the capture of fort sumter was printed willie ancrum said how is this tom ancrum and ham boykin's names are not here we thought from what they told us that they did most of the fighting colonel magruder1 has done something splendid on the 1 john bankhead magruder was a graduate of west point who had served in the mexican war and afterward while stationed at newport r i had become famous for his entertainments when virginia seceded he resigned his commission in the united states army after the war he settled in houston texas the battle of big bethel was fought on june 10 1861 the federals lost in killed and wounded about 100 among them theodore winthrop of new york author of cecil dreeme the confederate losses were very slight peninsula bethel is the name of the battle three hundred of the enemy killed they say our people southerners i mean continue to drop in from the outside world and what a contempt those who seceded a few days sooner feel for those who have just come out a camden notable called jim velipigue said in the street to day at heart robert e lee is against us that i know what will not people say in war times also he said that colonel kershaw wanted general beauregard to change the name of the stream near manassas station bull's run is so unrefined beauregard answered let us try and make it as great a name as your south carolina cowpens 1 mrs chesnut born in philadelphia can not see what right we have to take mt vernon from our northern sisters she thinks that ought to be common to both parties we think they will get their share of this world's goods do what we may and we will keep mt vernon if we can no comfort in mr chesnut's letter from richmond unutterable confusion prevails and discord already in charleston a butcher has been clandestinely supplying the yankee fleet outside the bar with beef they say he gave the information which led to the capture of the savannah they will hang him mr petigru alone in south carolina has not seceded when they pray for our president he gets up from his knees he might risk a prayer for mr davis i doubt if 1 the battle of the cowpens in south carolina was fought on january 17 1781 the british under colonel tarleton being defeated by general morgan with a loss to the british of 300 killed and wounded and 500 prisoners it would seriously do mr davis any good mr petigru is too clever to think himself one of the righteous whose prayers avail so overly much mr petigru's disciple mr bryan followed his example mr petigru has such a keen sense of the ridiculous he must be laughing in his sleeve at the hubbub this untimely trait of independence has raised looking out for a battle at manassas station i am always ill the name of my disease is a longing to get away from here and to go to richmond june 19th in england mr gregory and mr lyndsey rise to say a good word for us heaven reward them shower down its choicest blessings on their devoted heads as the fiction folks say barnwell heyward telegraphed me to meet him at kingsville but i was at cool spring johnny's plantation and all my clothes were at sandy hill our home in the sand hills so i lost that good opportunity of the very nicest escort to richmond tried to rise above the agonies of every day life read emerson too restless manassas on the brain russell's letters are filled with rubbish about our wanting an english prince to reign over us he actually intimates that the noisy arming drumming marching proclaiming at the north scares us yes as the making of faces and turning of somersaults by the chinese scared the english mr binney1 has written a letter it is in the intelligencer of philadelphia he offers lincoln his life and fortune all that he has put at lincoln's disposal to conquer us queer we only want to separate from them and 1 horace binney one of the foremost lawyers of philadelphia who was closely associated with the literary scientific and philanthropic interests of his time his wife was a sister of mrs chesnut the author's mother in law they put such an inordinate value on us they are willing to risk all life and limb and all their money to keep us they love us so mr chesnut is accused of firing the first shot and his cousin an ex west pointer writes in a martial fury they confounded the best shot made on the island the day of the picnic with the first shot at fort sumter this last is claimed by captain james others say it was one of the gibbeses who first fired but it was anderson who fired the train which blew up the union he slipped into fort sumter that night when we expected to talk it all over a letter from my husband dated headquarters manassas junction june 16 1861 my dear mary i wrote you a short letter from richmond last wednesday and came here next day found the camp all busy and preparing for a vigorous defense we have here at this camp seven regiments and in the same command at posts in the neighborhood six others say ten thousand good men the general and the men feel confident that they can whip twice that number of the enemy at least i have been in the saddle for two days all day with the general to become familiar with the topography of the country and the posts he intends to assume and the communications between them we learned general johnston has evacuated harper's ferry and taken up his position at winchester to meet the advancing column of mcclellan and to avoid being cut off by the three columns which were advancing upon him neither johnston nor beauregard considers harper's ferry as very important in a strategic point of view i think it most probable that the next battle you will hear of will be between the forces of johnston and mcclellan i think what we particularly need is a head in the field a major general to combine and conduct all the forces as well as plan a general and energetic campaign still we have all confidence that we will defeat the enemy whenever and wherever we meet in general engagement although the majority of the people just around here are with us still there are many who are against us god bless you yours james chesnut jr mary hammy and myself are off for richmond rev mr meynardie of the methodist persuasion goes with us we are to be under his care war cloud lowering isaac hayne the man who fought a duel with ben alston across the dinner table and yet lives is the bravest of the brave he attacks russell in the mercury in the public prints for saying we wanted an english prince to the fore not we indeed every man wants to be at the head of affairs himself if he can not be king himself then a republic of course it was hardly necessary to do more than laugh at russell's absurd idea there was a great deal of the wildest kind of talk at the mills house russell writes candidly enough of the british in india we can hardly expect him to suppress what is to our detriment june 24th last night i was awakened by loud talking and candles flashing tramping of feet growls dying away in the distance loud calls from point to point in the yard up i started my heart in my mouth some dreadful thing had happened a battle a death a horrible accident some one was screaming aloft that is from the top of the stairway hoarsely like a boatswain in a storm old colonel chesnut was storming at the sleepy negroes looking for fire with lighted candles in closets and everywhere else i dressed and came upon the scene of action what is it any news no no only mamma smells a smell she thinks something is burning somewhere the whole yard was alive literally swarming there are sixty or seventy people kept here to wait upon this household two thirds of them too old or too young to be of any use but families remain intact the old colonel has a magnificent voice i am sure it can be heard for miles literally be was roaring from the piazza giving orders to the busy crowd who were hunting the smell of fire old mrs chesnut is deaf so she did not know what a commotion she was creating she is very sensitive to bad odors candles have to be taken out of the room to be snuffed lamps are extinguished only in the porticoes or farther afield she finds violets oppressive can only tolerate a single kind of sweet rose a tea rose she will not have in her room she was totally innocent of the storm she had raised and in a mild sweet voice was suggesting places to be searched i was weak enough to laugh hysterically the bombardment of fort sumter was nothing to this after this alarm enough to wake the dead the smell was found a family had been boiling soap around the soap pot they had swept up some woolen rags raking up the fire to make all safe before going to bed this was heaped up with the ashes and its faint smoldering tainted the air at least to mrs chesnut's nose two hundred yards or more away yesterday some of the negro men on the plantation were found with pistols i have never before seen aught about any negro to show that they knew we had a war on hand in which they have any interest mrs john de saussure bade me good by and god bless you i was touched camden people never show any more feeling or sympathy than red indians except at a funeral it is expected of all to howl then and if you don't show feeling indignation awaits the delinquent june 27 1861 mr meynardie was perfect in the part of traveling companion he had his pleasures too the most pious and eloquent of parsons is human and he enjoyed the converse of the eminent persons who turned up on every hand and gave their views freely on all matters of state mr lawrence keitt joined us en route with him came his wife and baby we don't think alike but mr keitt is always original and entertaining already he pronounces jeff davis a failure and his cabinet a farce prophetic i suggested as he gave his opinion before the administration had fairly got under way he was fierce in his fault finding as to mr chesnut's vote for jeff davis he says mr chesnut overpersuaded the judge and those two turned the tide at least with the south carolina delegation we wrangled as we always do he says howell cobb's common sense might have saved us two quiet unobtrusive yankee school teachers were on the train i had spoken to them and they had told me all about themselves so i wrote on a scrap of paper do not abuse our home and house so before these yankee strangers going north those girls are schoolmistresses returning from whence they came soldiers everywhere they seem to be in the air and certainly to fill all space keitt quoted a funny georgia man who says we try our soldiers to see if they are hot enough before we enlist them if when water is thrown on them they do not sizz they won't do their patriotism is too cool to show they were wide awake and sympathizing enthusiastically every woman from every window of every house we passed waved a handkerchief if she had one this fluttering of white flags from every side never ceased from camden to richmond another new symptom parties of girls came to every station simply to look at the troops passing they always stood the girls i mean in solid phalanx and as the sun was generally in their eyes they made faces mary hammy never tired of laughing at this peculiarity of her sister patriots at the depot in richmond mr mallory with wigfall and garnett met us we had no cause to complain of the warmth of our reception they had a carriage for us and our rooms were taken at the spotswood but then the people who were in the rooms engaged for us had not departed at the time they said they were going they lingered among the delights of richmond and we knew of no law to make them keep their words and go mrs preston had gone for a few days to manassas so we took her room mrs davis is as kind as ever she met us in one of the corridors accidentally and asked us to join her party and to take our meals at her table mr preston came and we moved into a room so small there was only space for a bed wash stand and glass over it my things were hung up out of the way on nails behind the door as soon as my husband heard we had arrived he came too after dinner he sat smoking the solitary chair of the apartment tilted against the door as he smoked and my poor dresses were fumigated i remonstrated feebly war times said he nobody is fussy now when i go back to manassas to morrow you will be awfully sorry you snubbed me about those trumpery things up there so he smoked the pipe of peace for i knew that his remarks were painfully true as soon as he was once more under the enemy's guns i would repent in sackcloth and ashes captain ingraham came with colonel lamar 1 the latter said he could only stay five minutes he was obliged to go back at once to his camp that was a little before eight however at twelve he was still talking to us on that sofa we taunted him with his fine words to the the f f v crowd before the spotswood virginia has no grievance she raises her strong arm to catch the blow aimed at her weaker sisters he liked it well however that we knew his speech by heart this spotswood is a miniature world the war topic is not so much avoided as that everybody has some personal dignity to take care of and everybody else is indifferent to it i mean the personal dignity of autrui in this wild confusion everything likely and unlikely is told you and then everything is as flatly contradicted at any rate it is safest not to talk of the war trescott was telling us how they laughed at little south carolina in washington people said it was almost as large as long island which is hardly more than a tailfeather of new york always there is a child who sulks and won't play that was our role and we were posing as san marino and all model spirited though small republics pose he tells us that lincoln is a humorist lincoln sees the fun of things he thinks if they had left us in a corner or out in the cold a while pouting with our fingers in our mouth by hook or by crook he could have got us back but anderson spoiled all in mrs davis's drawing room last night the president took a seat by me on the sofa where i sat he talked for nearly an hour he laughed at our faith in our own powers we are like the british we think every southerner equal to three yankees at least we will have to be equivalent to a dozen now after his experience of the fighting qualities of southerners in mexico he believes that we will do all that can be done by pluck and muscle endurance and dogged courage dash and red hot patriotism and yet his tone was not sanguine there was a sad refrain running through it all for one thing either way he thinks it will be a long war that floored me at once it has been too long for me already then he said before the end came we would have many a bitter experience he said only fools doubted the courage of the yankees or their willingness to fight when they saw fit and now that we have stung their pride we have roused them till they will fight like devils mrs bradley johnson is here a regular heroine she outgeneraled the governor of north carolina in some way and has got arms and clothes and ammunition for her husband's regiment 1 there was some joke the regimental breeches were all wrong but a tailor righted that hind part before or something odd captain hartstein came to day with mrs bartow colonel bartow is colonel of a georgia regiment now in virginia he was the mayor of savannah who helped to wake the patriotic echoes the livelong night under my sleepless head into the small hours in charleston in november last his wife is a charming person witty and wise daughter of judge berrien she had on a white muslin apron with pink bows on the pockets it gave her a gay and girlish air and yet she must be as old as i am mr lamar who does not love slavery more than sumner does nor than i do laughs at the compliment new england pays us we want to separate from them to be rid of the yankees forever at any price and they hate us so and would clasp us or grapple us as polonius has it to their bosoms with hooks of steel we are an unwilling bride i think incompatibility of temper began when it was made plain to us that we got all the opprobrium of slavery and they all the money there was in it with their tariff mr lamar says the young men are light hearted because there is a fight on hand but those few who look ahead the clear heads they see all the risk the loss of land limb and life home wife and children as in the brave days of old they take to it for their country's sake they are ready and willing come what may but not so light hearted as the jeunesse dorée june 29th mrs preston mrs wigfall mary hammy and i drove in a fine open carriage to see the champ de mars it was a grand tableau out there mr davis rode a beautiful gray horse the arab edwin de leon brought him from egypt his worst enemy will allow that he is a consummate rider graceful and easy in the saddle and mr chesnut who has talked horse with his father ever since he was born owns that mr davis knows more about horses than any man he has met yet general lee was there with him also joe davis and wigfall acting as his aides poor mr lamar has been brought from his camp paralysis or some sort of shock every woman in the house is ready to rush into the florence nightingale business i think i will wait for a wounded man to make my first effort as sister of charity mr lamar sent for me as everybody went mr davis setting the example so did i lamar will not die this time will men flatter and make eyes until their eyes close in death at the ministering angels he was the same old lamar of the drawing room it is pleasant at the president's table my seat is next to joe davis with mr browne on the other side and mr mallory opposite there is great constraint however as soon as i came i repeated what the north carolina man said on the cars that north carolina had 20,000 men ready and they were kept back by mr walker etc the president caught something of what i was saying and asked me to repeat it which i did although i was scared to death madame when you see that person tell him his statement is false we are too anxious here for troops to refuse a man who offers himself not to speak of 20,000 men silence ensued of the most profound uncle h gave me three hundred dollars for his daughter mary's expenses making four in all that i have of hers he would pay me one hundred which he said he owed my husband for a horse i thought it an excuse to lend me money i told him i had enough and to spare for all my needs until my colonel came home from the wars ben allston the governor's son is here came to see me does not show much of the wit of the petigrus pleasant person however mr brewster and wigfall came at the same time the former chafing at wigfall's anomalous position here gave him fiery advice mr wigfall was calm and full of common sense a brave man and without a thought of any necessity for displaying his temper he said brewster at this time before the country is strong and settled in her new career it would be disastrous for us the head men to engage in a row among ourselves as i was brushing flies away and fanning the prostrate lamar i reported mr davis's conversation of the night before he is all right said mr lamar the fight had to come we are men not women the quarrel had lasted long enough we hate each other so the fight had to come even homer's heroes after they had stormed and scolded enough fought like brave men long and well if the athlete sumner had stood on his manhood and training and struck back when preston brooks assailed him preston brooks's blow need not have been the opening skirmish of the war sumner's country took up the fight because he did not sumner chose his own battle field and it was the worse for us what an awful blunder that preston brooks business was lamar said yankees did not fight for the fun of it they always made it pay or let it alone met mr lyon with news indeed a man here in the midst of us taken with lincoln's passports etc in his pocket a palpable spy mr lyon said he would be hanged in all human probability that is a letter from my husband written at camp pickens and saying if you and mrs preston can make up your minds to leave richmond and can come up to a nice little country house near orange court house we could come to see you frequently while the army is stationed here it would be a safe place for the present near the scene of action and directly in the line of news from all sides so we go to orange court house read the story of soulouque 1 the haytian man he has wonderful interest just now slavery has to go of course and joy go with it these yankees may kill us and lay waste our land for a while but conquer us never
june 2d a battle1 is said to be raging round richmond i am at the prestons james chesnut has gone to richmond suddenly on business of the military department it is always his luck to arrive in the nick of time and be present at a great battle wade hampton shot in the foot and johnston pettigrew killed a telegram says lee and davis were both on the field the enemy being repulsed telegraph operator said madam our men are fighting of course they are what else is there for them to do now but fight but madam the news is encouraging each army is burying its dead that looks like a drawn battle we haunt the bulletin board back to mcmahan's mem cohen is ill her daughter isabel warns me not to mention the battle raging around richmond young cohen is in it mrs preston anxious and unhappy about her sons john is with general huger at richmond willie in the swamps on the coast with his company mem tells me her cousin edwin de leon is sent by mr davis on a mission to england rev robert barnwell has returned to the hospital oh that we had given our thousand dollars to the hospital and not to the gunboat stonewall jackson's movements the herald says do us no harm it is bringing out volunteers in great numbers and a philadelphia paper abused us so fervently i felt all the blood in me rush to my head with rage june 3d doctor john cheves is making infernal machines in charleston to blow the yankees up pretty name they have those machines my horses the overseer says are too poor to send over there was corn enough on the place for two years they said in january now in june they write that it will not last until the new crop comes in somebody is having a good time on the plantation if it be not my poor horses molly will tell me all when she comes back and more mr venable has been made an aide to general robert e lee he is at vicksburg and writes when the fight is over here i shall be glad to go to virginia he is in capital spirits i notice army men all are when they write apropos of calling major venable mr let it be noted that in social intercourse we are not prone to give handles to the names of those we know well and of our nearest and dearest a general's wife thinks it bad form to call her husband anything but mr when she gives him his title she simply drops into it by accident if i am mixed on titles in this diary let no one blame me telegrams come from richmond ordering troops from charleston can not be sent for the yankees are attacking charleston doubtless with the purpose to prevent lee's receiving reenforcements from there sat down at my window in the beautiful moonlight and tried hard for pleasant thoughts a man began to play on the flute with piano accompaniment first ever of thee i am fondly dreaming and then the long long weary day at first i found this but a complement to the beautiful scene and it was soothing to my wrought up nerves but von weber's last waltz was too much i broke down heavens what a bitter cry came forth with such floods of tears the wonder is there was any of me left i learn that richmond women go in their carriages for the wounded carry them home and nurse them one saw a man too weak to hold his musket she took it from him put it on her shoulder and helped the poor fellow along if ever there was a man who could control every expression of emotion who could play stoic or an indian chief it is james chesnut but one day when he came in from the council he had to own to a break down he was awfully ashamed of his weakness there was a letter from mrs gaillard asking him to help her and he tried to read it to the council she wanted a permit to go on to her son who lies wounded in virginia colonel chesnut could not control his voice there was not a dry eye there when suddenly one man called out god bless the woman johnston pettigrew's aide says he left his chief mortally wounded on the battle field just before johnston pettigrew went to italy to take a hand in the war there for freedom i met him one day at mrs frank hampton's a number of people were present some one spoke of the engagement of the beautiful miss to hugh rose some one else asked how do you know they are engaged well i never heard it but i saw it in london a month or so ago i entered mrs s drawing room and i saw these two young people seated on a sofa opposite the door well that amounted to nothing no not in itself but they looked so foolish and so happy i have noticed newly engaged people always look that way and so on johnston pettigrew was white and red in quick succession during this turn of the conversation he was in a rage of indignation and disgust i think this kind of talk is taking a liberty with the young lady's name he exclaimed finally and that it is an impertinence in us i fancy him left dying alone i wonder what they feel those who are left to die of their wounds alone on the battle field free schools are not everything as witness this spelling yankee epistles found in camp show how illiterate they can be with all their boasted schools fredericksburg is spelled fredrexbirg medicine metison and we read to my sweat brother etc for the first time in my life no books can interest me life is so real so utterly earnest that fiction is flat nothing but what is going on in this distracted world of ours can arrest my attention for ten minutes at a time june 4th battles occur near richmond with bombardment of charleston beauregard is said to be fighting his way out or in mrs gibson is here at doctor gibbes's tears are always in her eyes her eldest son is willie preston's lieutenant they are down on the coast she owns that she has no hope at all she was a miss ayer of philadelphia and says we may look for burnside now our troops which held him down to his iron flotilla have been withdrawn they are three to one against us now and they have hardly begun to put out their strength in numbers i mean we have come to the end of our tether except we wait for the yearly crop of boys as they grow up to the requisite age she would make despondent the most sanguine person alive as a general rule says mrs gibson government people are sanguine but the son of one high functionary whispered to mary g as he handed her into the car richmond is bound to go the idea now is that we are to be starved out if they shut us in prolong the agony it can then have but one end mrs preston and i speak in whispers but mrs mccord scorns whispers and speaks out she says there are our soldiers since the world began there never were better but god does not deign to send us a general worthy of them i do not mean drill sergeants or military old maids who will not fight until everything is just so the real ammunition of our war is faith in ourselves and enthusiasm in our cause west point sits down on enthusiasm laughs it to scorn it wants discipline and now comes a new danger these blockade runners they are filling their pockets and they gibe and sneer at the fools who fight don't you see this stonewall how he fires the soldiers hearts he will be our leader maybe after all they say he does not care how many are killed his business is to save the country not the army he fights to win god bless him and he wins if they do not want to be killed they can stay at home they say he leaves the sick and wounded to be cared for by those whose business it is to do so his business is war they say he wants to hoist the black flag have a short sharp decisive war and end it he is a christian soldier june 5th beauregard retreating and his rear guard cut off if beauregard's veterans will not stand why should we expect our newly levied reserves to do it the yankee general who is besieging savannah announces his orders are to take savannah in two weeks time and then proceed to erase charleston from the face of the earth albert luryea was killed in the battle of june 1st last summer when a bomb fell in the very thick of his company he picked it up and threw it into the water think of that those of ye who love life the company sent the bomb to his father inscribed on it were the words albert luryea bravest where all are brave isaac hayne did the same thing at fort moultrie this race has brains enough but they are not active minded like those old revolutionary characters the middletons lowndeses rutledges marions summers they have come direct from active minded forefathers or they would not have been here but with two or three generations of gentlemen planters how changed has the blood become of late all the active minded men who have sprung to the front in our government were immediate descendants of scotch or scotch irish calhoun mcduffie cheves and petigru who huguenotted his name but could not tie up his irish our planters are nice fellows but slow to move impulsive but hard to keep moving they are wonderful for a spurt but with all their strength they like to rest june 6th paul hayne the poet has taken rooms here my husband came and offered to buy me a pair of horses he says i need more exercise in the open air come now are you providing me with the means of a rapid retreat said i i am pretty badly equipped for marching mrs rose greenhow is in richmond one half of the ungrateful confederates say seward sent her my husband says the confederacy owes her a debt it can never pay she warned them at manassas and so they got joe johnston and his paladins to appear upon the stage in the very nick of time in washington they said lord napier left her a legacy to the british legation which accepted the gift unlike the british nation who would not accept emma hamilton and her daughter horatia though they were willed to the nation by lord nelson mem cohen fresh from the hospital where she went with a beautiful jewish friend rachel as we will call her be it her name or no was put to feed a very weak patient mem noticed what a handsome fellow he was and how quiet and clean she fancied by those tokens that he was a gentleman in performance of her duties the lovely young nurse leaned kindly over him and held the cup to his lips when that ceremony was over and she had wiped his mouth to her horror she felt a pair of by no means weak arms around her neck and a kiss upon her lips which she thought strong indeed she did not say a word she made no complaint she slipped away from the hospital and hereafter in her hospital work will minister at long range no matter how weak and weary sick and sore the patient may be and said mem i thought he was a gentleman well a gentleman is a man after all and she ought not to have put those red lips of hers so near june 7th cheves mccord's battery on the coast has three guns and one hundred men if this battery should be captured john's island and james island would be open to the enemy and so charleston exposed utterly wade hampton writes to his wife that chickahominy was not as decided a victory as he could have wished fort pillow and memphis1 have been given up next and next june 9th when we read of the battles in india in italy in the crimea what did we care only an interesting topic like any other to look for in the paper now you hear of a battle with a thrill and a shudder it has come home to us half the people that we know in the world are under the enemy's guns a telegram reaches you and you leave it on your lap you are pale with fright you handle it or you dread to touch it as you would a rattlesnake worse worse a snake could only strike you how many many will this scrap of paper tell you have gone to their death when you meet people sad and sorrowful is the greeting they press your hand tears stand in their eyes or roll down their cheeks as they happen to possess more or less self control they have brother father or sons as the case may be in battle and now this thing seems never to stop we have no breathing time given us it can not be 1 fort pillow was on the mississippi above memphis it had been erected by the confederates but was occupied by the federals on june 5 1862 the confederates having evacuated and partially destroyed it the day before on june 6 1862 the federal fleet defeated the confederates near memphis the city soon afterward was occupied by the federals so at the north for the papers say gentlemen do not go into the ranks there but are officers or clerks of departments then we see so many members of foreign regiments among our prisoners germans irish scotch the proportion of trouble is awfully against us every company on the field rank and file is filled with our nearest and dearest who are common soldiers mem cohen's story to day a woman she knew heard her son was killed and had hardly taken in the horror of it when they came to say it was all a mistake in the name she fell on her knees with a shout of joy praise the lord o my soul she cried in her wild delight the household was totally upset the swing back of the pendulum from the scene of weeping and wailing of a few moments before was very exciting in the midst of this hubbub the hearse drove up with the poor boy in his metallic coffin does anybody wonder so many women die grief and constant anxiety kill nearly as many women at home as men are killed on the battle field mem's friend is at the point of death with brain fever the sudden changes from grief to joy and joy to grief were more than she could bear a story from new orleans as some yankees passed two boys playing in the street one of the boys threw a handful of burned cotton at them saying i keep this for you the other not to be outdone spit at the yankees and said i keep this for you the yankees marked the house afterward a corporal's guard came madam was affably conversing with a friend and in vain the friend who was a mere morning caller protested he was not the master of the house he was marched off to prison mr moise got his money out of new orleans he went to a station with his two sons who were quite small boys when he got there the carriage that he expected was not to be seen he had brought no money with him knowing he might be searched some friend called out i will lend you my horse but then you will be obliged to leave the children this offer was accepted and as he rode off one of the boys called out papa here is your tobacco which you have forgotten mr moise turned back and the boy handed up a roll of tobacco which he had held openly in his hand all the time mr moise took it and galloped off waving his hat to them in that roll of tobacco was encased twenty five thousand dollars now the mississippi is virtually open to the yankees beauregard has evacuated corinth 1 henry nott was killed at shiloh mrs auzé wrote to tell us she had no hope to be conquered and ruined had always been her fate strive as she might and now she knew it would be through her country that she would be made to feel she had had more than most women to endure and the battle of life she had tried to fight with courage patience faith long years ago when she was young her lover died afterward she married another then her husband died and next her only son when new orleans fell her only daughter was there and mrs auzé went to her well may she say that she has bravely borne her burden till now 2 stonewall said in his quaint way i like strong drink so i never touch it may heaven who sent him to help us save him from all harm my husband traced stonewall's triumphal career on the map he has defeated frémont and taken all his cannon now he is after shields the language of the telegram is vague stonewall has taken plenty of prisoners plenty no doubt and enough and to spare we can't feed our own soldiers and how are we to feed prisoners they denounce toombs in some georgia paper which i saw to day for planting a full crop of cotton they say he ought to plant provisions for soldiers and now every man in virginia and the eastern part of south carolina is in revolt because old men and boys are ordered out as a reserve corps and worst of all sacred property that is negroes have been seized and sent out to work on the fortifications along the coast line we are in a fine condition to fortify columbia june 10th general gregg writes that chickahominy1 was a victory manqué because joe johnston received a disabling wound and g w smith was ill the subordinates in command had not been made acquainted with the plan of battle a letter from john chesnut who says it must be all a mistake about wade hampton's wound for he saw him in the field to the very last that is until late that night hampton writes to mary mcduffie that the ball was extracted from his foot on the field and that he was in the saddle all day but that when he tried to take his boot off at night his foot was so inflamed and swollen the boot had to be cut away and the wound became more troublesome than he had expected mrs preston sent her carriage to take us to see mrs herbemont whom mary gibson calls her mrs burgamot miss bay came down ever blooming in a cap so formidable i could but laugh it was covered with a bristling row of white satin spikes she coyly refused to enter mrs preston's carriage to put foot into it to use her own words but she allowed herself to be overpersuaded i am so ill mrs ben taylor said to doctor trezevant surely she is too ill to be going about she ought to be in bed she is very feeble very nervous as you say but then she is living on nervous excitement if you shut her up she would die at once a queer weakness of the heart i have sometimes it beats so feebly i am sure it has stopped altogether then they say i have fainted but i never lose consciousness mrs preston and i were talking of negroes and cows a negro no matter how sensible he is on any other subject can never be convinced that there is any necessity to feed a cow turn em out and let em grass grass good nuff for cow famous news comes from richmond but not so good from the coast mrs izard said quoting i forget whom if west point could give brains as well as training smith is under arrest for disobedience of orders pemberton's orders this is the third general whom pemberton has displaced within a few weeks ripley mercer and now smith when i told my husband that molly was full of airs since her late trip home he made answer tell her to go to the devil she or anybody else on the plantation who is dissatisfied let them go it is bother enough to feed and clothe them now when he went over to the plantation he returned charmed with their loyalty to him their affection and their faithfulness sixteen more yankee regiments have landed on james island eason writes they have twice the energy and enterprise of our people i answered wait a while let them alone until climate and mosquitoes and sand flies and dealing with negroes takes it all out of them stonewall is a regular brick going all the time winning his way wherever he goes governor pickens called to see me his wife is in great trouble anxiety uncertainty her brother and her brother in law are either killed or taken prisoners tom taylor says wade hampton did not leave the field on account of his wound what heroism said some one no what luck he is the luckiest man alive he'll never be killed he was shot in the temple but that did not kill him his soldiers believe in his luck general scott on southern soldiers says we have élan courage woodcraft consummate horsemanship endurance of pain equal to the indians but that we will not submit to discipline we will not take care of things or husband our resources where we are there is waste and destruction if it could all be done by one wild desperate dash we would do it but he does not think we can stand the long blank months between the acts the waiting we can bear pain without a murmur but we will not submit to be bored etc now for the other side men of the north can wait they can bear discipline they can endure forever losses in battle are nothing to them their resources in men and materials of war are inexhaustible and if they see fit they will fight to the bitter end here is a nice prospect for us as comfortable as the old man's croak at mulberry bad times worse coming mrs mccord says in the hospital the better born that is those born in the purple the gentry those who are accustomed to a life of luxury are the better patients they endure in silence they are hardier stronger tougher less liable to break down than the sons of the soil why is that i asked and she answered something in man that is more than the body i know how it feels to die i have felt it again and again for instance some one calls out albert sidney johnston is killed my heart stands still i feel no more i am for so many seconds so many minutes i know not how long utterly without sensation of any kind dead and then there is that great throb that keen agony of physical pain and the works are wound up again the ticking of the clock begins and i take up the burden of life once more some day it will stop too long or my feeble heart will be too worn out to make that awakening jar and all will be over i do not think when the end comes that there will be any difference except the miracle of the new wind up throb and now good news is just as exciting as bad hurrah stonewall has saved us the pleasure is almost pain because of my way of feeling it miriam's luryea and the coincidences of his life he was born moses and is the hero of the bombshell his mother was at a hotel in charleston when kind hearted anna de leon moses went for her sister in law and gave up her own chamber that the child might be born in the comfort and privacy of a home only our people are given to such excessive hospitality so little luryea was born in anna de leon's chamber after chickahominy when he now a man lay mortally wounded anna moses who was living in richmond found him and she brought him home though her house was crowded to the door steps she gave up her chamber to him and so as he had been born in her room in her room he died june 12th new england's butler best known to us as beast butler is famous or infamous now his amazing order to his soldiers at new orleans and comments on it are in everybody's mouth we hardly expected from massachusetts behavior to shame a comanche one happy moment has come into mrs preston's life i watched her face to day as she read the morning papers willie's battery is lauded to the skies every paper gave him a paragraph of praise south carolina was at beauregard's feet after fort sumter since shiloh she has gotten up and looks askance rather when his name is mentioned and without price or beauregard who takes charge of the western forces can we hold out if england and france hold off cries mem no our time has come for shame faint heart our people are brave our cause is just our spirit and our patient endurance beyond reproach here came in mary cantey's voice i may not have any logic any sense i give it up my woman's instinct tells me all the same that slavery's time has come if we don't end it they will after all this tried to read uncle tom but could not too sickening think of a man sending his little son to beat a human being tied to a tree it is as bad as squeers beating smike flesh and blood revolt you must skip that it is too bad mr preston told a story of joe johnston as a boy a party of boys at abingdon were out on a spree more boys than horses so joe johnston rode behind john preston who is his cousin while going over the mountains they tried to change horses and got behind a servant who was in charge of them all the servant's horse kicked up threw joe johnston and broke his leg a bone showed itself hello boys come here and look the confounded bone has come clear through called out joe coolly they had to carry him on their shoulders relieving guard as one party grew tired another took him up they knew he must suffer fearfully but he never said so he was as cool and quiet after his hurt as before he was pretty roughly handled but they could not help it his father was in a towering rage because his son's leg was to be set by a country doctor and it might be crooked in the process at chickahominy brave but unlucky joe had already eleven wounds june 13th decca's wedding it took place last year we were all lying on the bed or sofas taking it coolly as to undress mrs singleton had the floor they were engaged before they went up to charlottesville alexander was on gregg's staff and gregg was not hard on him decca was the worst in love girl she ever saw letters came while we were at the hospital from alex urging her to let him marry her at once in war times human events life especially are very uncertain for several days consecutively she cried without ceasing and then she consented the rooms at the hospital were all crowded decca and i slept together in the same room it was arranged by letter that the marriage should take place a luncheon at her grandfather minor's and then she was to depart with alex for a few days at richmond that was to be their brief slice of honeymoon the day came the wedding breakfast was ready so was the bride in all her bridal array but no alex no bridegroom alas such is the uncertainty of a soldier's life the bride said nothing but she wept like a water nymph at dinner she plucked up heart and at my earnest request was about to join us and then the cry the bridegroom cometh he brought his best man and other friends we had a jolly dinner circumstances over which he had no control had kept him away his father sat next to decca and talked to her all the time as if she had been already married it was a piece of absent mindedness on his part pure and simple but it was very trying and the girl had had much to stand that morning you can well understand immediately after dinner the belated bridegroom proposed a walk so they went for a brief stroll up the mountain decca upon her return said to me send for robert barnwell i mean to be married to day impossible no spare room in the house no getting away from here the trains all gone don't you know this hospital place is crammed to the ceiling alex says i promised to marry him to day it is not his fault he could not come before i shook my head i don't care said the positive little thing i promised alex to marry him to day and i will send for the rev robert barnwell we found robert after a world of trouble and the bride lovely in swiss muslin was married then i proposed they should take another walk and i went to one of my sister nurses and begged her to take me in for the night as i wished to resign my room to the young couple at daylight next day they took the train for richmond such is the small allowance of honeymoon permitted in war time beauregard's telegram he can not leave the army of the west his health is bad no doubt the sea breezes would restore him but he can not come now such a lovely name gustave tautant beauregard but jackson and johnston and smith and jones will do and lee how short and sweet every day says mem they come here in shoals men to say we can not hold richmond and we can not hold charleston much longer wretches beasts why do you come here why don't you stay there and fight don't you see that you own yourselves cowards by coming away in the very face of a battle if you are not liars as to the danger you are cowards to run away from it thus roars the practical mem growing more furious at each word these jeremiahs laugh they think she means others not the present company tom huger resigned his place in the united states navy and came to us the iroquois was his ship in the old navy they say as he stood in the rigging after he was shot in the leg when his ship was leading the attack upon the iroquois his old crew in the iroquois cheered him and when his body was borne in the federals took off their caps in respect for his gallant conduct when he was dying meta huger said to him an of officer wants to see you he is one of the enemy let him come in i have no enemies now but when he heard the man's name no no i do not want to see a southern man who is now in lincoln's navy the officers of the united states navy attended his funeral june 14th all things are against us memphis gone mississippi fleet annihilated and we hear it all as stolidly apathetic as if it were a story of the english war against china which happened a year or so ago the sons of mrs john julius pringle have come they were left at school in the north a young huger is with them they seem to have had adventures enough walked waded rowed in boats if boats they could find swam rivers when boats there were none brave lads are they one can but admire their pluck and energy mrs fisher of philadelphia née middleton gave them money to make the attempt to get home stuart's cavalry have rushed through mcclellan's lines and burned five of his transports jackson has been reenforced by 16,000 men and they hope the enemy will be drawn from around richmond and the valley be the seat of war john chesnut is in whiting's brigade which has been sent to stonewall mem's son is with the boykin rangers company a no 1 we call it and she has persistently wept ever since she heard the news it is no child's play she says when you are with stonewall he doesn't play at soldiering he doesn't take care of his men at all he only goes to kill the yankees wade hampton is here shot in the foot but he knows no more about france than he does of the man in the moon wet blanket he is just now johnston badly wounded lee is king of spades they are all once more digging for dear life unless we can reenforce stonewall the game is up our chiefs contrive to dampen and destroy the enthusiasm of all who go near them so much entrenching and falling back destroys the morale of any army this everlasting retreating it kills the hearts of the men then we are scant of powder james chesnut is awfully proud of le conte's powder manufactory here le conte knows how to do it james chesnut provides him the means to carry out his plans colonel venable doesn't mince matters if we do not deal a blow a blow that will be felt it will be soon all up with us i he southwest will be lost to us we can not afford to shilly shally much longer thousands are enlisting on the other side in new orleans butler holds out inducements to be sure they are principally foreigners who want to escape starvation tennessee we may count on as gone since we abandoned her at corinth fort pillow and memphis a man must be sent there or it is all gone now you call a spade by that name it seems and not an agricultural implement they call mars robert old spade lee he keeps them digging so general lee is a noble virginian respect something in this world cæsar call him old spade cæsar as a soldier he was as much above suspicion as he required his wife to be as cæsar's wife you know if i remember cæsar's commentaries he owns up to a lot of entrenching you let mars robert alone he knows what he is about tell us of the women folk at new orleans how did they take the fall of the city they are an excitable race the man from that city said as my informant was standing on the levee a daintily dressed lady picked her way parasol in hand toward him she accosted him with great politeness and her face was as placid and unmoved as in antebellum days her first question was will you be so kind as to tell me what is the last general order no order that i know of madam general disorder prevails now ah i see and why are those persons flying and yelling so noisily and racing in the streets in that unseemly way they are looking for a shell to burst over their heads at any moment ah then with a courtesy of dignity and grace she waved her parasol and departed but stopped to arrange that parasol at a proper angle to protect her face from the sun there was no vulgar haste in her movements she tripped away as gracefully as she came my informant had failed to discompose her by his fearful rations that was the one self possessed soul then in new orleans another woman drew near so overheated and out of breath she had barely time to say she had run miles of squares in her crazy terror and bewilderment when a sudden shower came up in a second she was cool and calm she forgot all the questions she came to ask my bonnet i must save it at any sacrifice she said and so turned her dress over her head and went off forgetting her country's trouble and screaming for a cab went to see mrs burroughs at the old de saussure house she has such a sweet face such soft kind beautiful dark gray eyes such eyes are a poem no wonder she had a long love story we sat in the piazza at twelve o'clock of a june day the glorious southern sun shining its very hottest but we were in a dense shade magnolias in full bloom ivy vines of i know not what and roses in profusion closed us in it was a living wall of everything beautiful and sweet in all this flower garden of a columbia that is the most delicious corner i have been in yet got from the prestons french library fanny with a brilliant preface by jules janier now then i have come to the worst there can be no worse book than fanny the lover is jealous of the husband the woman is for the polyandry rule of life she cheats both and refuses to break with either but to criticize it one must be as shameless as the book itself of course it is clever to the last degree or it would be kicked into the gutter it is not nastier or coarser than mrs stowe but then it is not written in the interests of philanthropy we had an unexpected dinner party to day first wade hampton came and his wife then mr and mrs rose i remember that the late colonel hampton once said to me a thing i thought odd at the time mrs james rose and i forget now who was the other are the only two people on this side of the water who know how to give a state dinner mr and mrs james rose if anybody body wishes to describe old carolina at its best let them try their hands at painting these two people wade hampton still limps a little but he is rapidly recovering here is what he said and he has fought so well that he is listened to if we mean to play at war as we play a game of chess west point tactics prevailing we are sure to lose the game they have every advantage they can lose pawns ad infinitum to the end of time and never feel it we will be throwing away all that we had hoped so much from southern hot headed dash reckless gallantry spirit of adventure readiness to lead forlorn hopes mrs rose is miss sarah parker's aunt somehow it came out when i was not in the room but those girls tell me everything it seems miss sarah said the reason i can not bear mrs chesnut is that she laughs at everything and at everybody if she saw me now she would give me credit for some pretty hearty crying as well as laughing it was a mortifying thing to hear about one's self all the same general preston came in and announced that mr chesnut was in town he had just seen mr alfred huger who came up on the charleston train with him then mrs mccord came and offered to take me back to mrs mcmahan's to look him up i found my room locked up lawrence said his master had gone to look for me at the prestons mrs mccord proposed we should further seek for my errant husband at the door we met governor pickens who showed us telegrams from the president of the most important nature the governor added and i have one from jeems chesnut but i hear he has followed it so closely coming on its heels as it were that i need not show you that one you don't look interested at the sound of your husband's name said he is that his name asked i i supposed it was james my advice to you is to find him for mrs pickens says he was last seen in the company of two very handsome women and now you may call him any name you please we soon met the two beautiful dames governor pickens threw in my teeth were some ladies from rafton creek almost neighbors who live near camden by way of pleasant remark to wade hampton oh general the next battle will give you a chance to be major general i was very foolish to give up my legion he answered gloomily promotion don't really annoy many people mary gibson says her father writes to them that they may go back he thinks now that the confederates can hold richmond gloria in excelsis another personal defeat little kate said oh cousin mary why don't you cultivate heart they say at kirkwood that you had better let your brains alone a while and cultivate heart she had evidently caught up a phrase and repeated it again and again for my benefit so that is the way they talk of me the only good of loving any one with your whole heart is to give that person the power to hurt you june 24th mr chesnut having missed the secessionville1 fight by half a day was determined to see the one around richmond he went off with general cooper and wade hampton blanton duncan sent them for a luncheon on board the cars ice wine and every manner of good thing in all this death and destruction the women are the same chatter patter clatter oh the charleston refugees are so full of airs there is no sympathy for them here oh indeed that is queer they are not half as exclusive as these hamptons and prestons the airs these people do give themselves airs airs laughed mrs bartow parodying tennyson's charge of the light brigade airs to the right of them airs to the left of them some one had blundered volleyed and thundered rhymes but is out of place the worst of all airs came from a democratic landlady who was asked by mrs president davis to have a carpet shaken and shook herself with rage as she answered you know madam you need not stay here if my carpet or anything else does not suit you john chesnut gives us a spirited account of their ride around mcclellan i sent the letter to his grandfather the women ran out screaming with joyful welcome as soon as they caught sight of our soldiers gray uniforms ran to them bringing handfuls and armfuls of food one gray headed man after preparing a hasty meal for them knelt and prayed as they snatched it as you may say they were in the saddle from friday until sunday they were used up so were their horses johnny writes for clothes and more horses miss s c says no need to send any more of his fine horses to be killed or captured by the yankees wait and see how the siege of richmond ends the horses will go all the same as johnny wants them june 25th i forgot to tell of mrs pickens's reception for general hampton my mem dear described it all the governess tut mem that is not the right name for her she is not a teacher never mind it is the easier to say than the governor's wife madame la gouvernante was suggested why that is worse than the other met him at the door took his crutch away putting his hand upon her shoulder instead that is the way to greet heroes she said her blue eyes were aflame and in response poor wade smiled and smiled until his face hardened into a fixed grin of embarrassment and annoyance he is a simple mannered man you know and does not want to be made much of by women the butler was not in plain clothes but wore as the other servants did magnificent livery brought from the court of st petersburg one mass of gold embroidery etc they had champagne and russian tea the latter from a samovar made in russia little moses was there now for us they have never put their servants into russian livery nor paraded little moses under our noses but i must confess the russian tea and champagne set before us left nothing to be desired how did general hampton bear his honors well to the last he looked as if he wished they would let him alone met mr ashmore fresh from richmond he says stonewall is coming up behind mcclellan and here comes the tug of war he thinks we have so many spies in richmond they may have found out our strategic movements and so may circumvent them mrs bartow's story of a clever miss toombs so many men were in love with her and the courtship while it lasted of each one was as exciting and bewildering as a fox chase she liked the fun of the run but she wanted something more than to know a man was in mad pursuit of her that he should love her she agreed but she must love him too how was she to tell yet she must be certain of it before she said yes so as they sat by the lamp she would look at him and inwardly ask herself would i be willing to spend the long winter evenings forever after sitting here darning your old stockings never echo answered no no a thousand times no so each had to make way for another june 27th we went in a body half a dozen ladies with no man on escort duty for they are all in the army to a concert mrs pickens came in she was joined soon by secretary moses and mr follen doctor berrien came to our relief nothing could be more execrable than the singing financially the thing was a great success for though the audience was altogether feminine it was a very large one telegram from mr chesnut safe in richmond that is if richmond be safe with all the power of the united states of america battering at her gates strange not a word from stonewall jackson after all doctor gibson telegraphs his wife stay where you are terrible battle1 looked for here decca is dead that poor little darling immediately after her baby was born she took it into her head that alex was killed he was wounded but those around had not told her of it she surprised them by asking does any one know how the battle has gone since alex was killed she could not read for a day or so before she died her head was bewildered but she would not let any one else touch her letters so she died with several unopened ones in her bosom mrs singleton decca's mother fainted dead away but she shed no tears we went to the house and saw alex's mother a daughter of langdon cheves annie was with us she said this is the saddest thing for alex no said his mother death is never the saddest thing if he were not a good man that would be a far worse thing annie in utter amazement whimpered but alex is so good already yes seven years ago the death of one of his sisters that he dearly loved made him a christian that death in our family was worth a thousand lives one needs a hard heart now even old mr shand shed tears mary barnwell sat as still as a statue as white and stony grief which can relieve itself by tears is a thing to pray for said the rev mr shand then came a telegram from hampton all well so far we are successful robert barnwell had been telegraphed for his answer came can't leave here gregg is fighting across the chickahominy said alex's mother my son alex may never hear this sad news and her lip settled rigidly go on what else does hampton say asked she lee has one wing of the army stonewall the other annie hampton came to tell us the latest news that we have abandoned james island and are fortifying morris island and now she says if the enemy will be so kind as to wait we will be ready for them in two months rev mr shand and that pious christian woman alex's mother who looks into your very soul with those large and lustrous blue eyes of hers agreed that the yankees even if they took charleston would not destroy it i think they will sinner that i am mr shand remarked to her madam you have two sons in the army alex's mother replied i have had six sons in the army i now have five there are people here too small to conceive of any larger business than quarreling in the newspapers one laughs at squibs in the papers now in such times as these with the wolf at our doors men safe in their closets writing fiery articles denouncing those who are at work are beneath contempt only critics with muskets on their shoulders have the right to speak now as trenholm said the other night in a pouring rain we went to that poor child's funeral to decca's they buried her in the little white frock she wore when she engaged herself to alex and which she again put on for her bridal about a year ago she lies now in the churchyard in sight of my window is she to be pitied she said she had had months of perfect happiness how many people can say that so many of us live their long dreary lives and then happiness never comes to meet them at all it seems so near and yet it eludes them forever june 28th victory victory heads every telegram now 1 one reads it on the bulletin board it is the anniversary of the battle of fort moultrie the enemy went off so quickly i wonder if it was not a trap laid for us to lead us away from richmond to some place where they can manage to do us more harm and now comes the list of killed and wounded victory does not seem to soothe sore hearts mrs haskell has five sons before the enemy's illimitable cannon mrs preston two mcclellan is routed and we have twelve thousand prisoners prisoners my god and what are we to do with them we can't feed our own people for the first time since joe johnston was wounded at seven pines we may breathe freely we were so afraid of another general or a new one stonewall can not be everywhere though he comes near it magruder did splendidly at big bethel it was a wonderful thing how he played his ten thousand before mcclellan like fireflies and utterly deluded him it was partly due to the manassas scare that we gave them they will never be foolhardy again now we are throwing up our caps for r e lee we hope from the lees what the first sprightly running at manassas could not give we do hope there will be no ifs ifs have ruined us shiloh was a victory if albert sidney johnston had not been killed seven pines if joe johnston had not been wounded the ifs bristle like porcupines that victory at manassas did nothing but send us off in a fool's paradise of conceit and it roused the manhood of the northern people for very shame they had to move up a french man of war lies at the wharf at charleston to take off french subjects when the bombardment begins william mazyck writes that the enemy's gunboats are shelling and burning property up and down the santee river they raise the white flag and the negroes rush down on them planters might as well have let these negroes be taken by the council to work on the fortifications a letter from my husband richmond june 29 1862 my dear mary for the last three days i have been a witness of the most stirring events of modern times on my arrival here i found the government so absorbed in the great battle pending that i found it useless to talk of the special business that brought me to this place as soon as it is over which will probably be to morrow i think that i can easily accomplish all that i was sent for i have no doubt that we can procure another general and more forces etc the president and general lee are inclined to listen to me and to do all they can for us general lee is vindicating the high opinion i have ever expressed of him and his plans and executions of the last great fight will place him high in the roll of really great commanders the fight on friday was the largest and fiercest of the whole war some 60,000 or 70,000 with great preponderance on the side of the enemy ground numbers armament etc were all in favor of the enemy but our men and generals were superior the higher officers and men behaved with a resolution and dashing heroism that have never been surpassed in any country or in any age our line was three times repulsed by superior numbers and superior artillery impregnably posted then lee assembling all his generals to the front told them that victory depended on carrying the batteries and defeating the army before them ere night should fall should night come without victory all was lost and the work must be done by the bayonet our men then made a rapid and irresistible charge without powder and carried everything the enemy melted before them and ran with the utmost speed though of the regulars of the federal army the fight between the artillery of the opposing forces was terrific and sublime the field became one dense cloud of smoke so that nothing could be seen but the incessant flash of fire they were within sixteen hundred yards of each other and it rained storms of grape and canister we took twenty three pieces of their artillery many small arms and small ammunition they burned most of their stores wagons etc the victory of the second day was full and complete yesterday there was little or no fighting but some splendid maneuvering which has placed us completely around them i think the end must be decisive in our favor we have lost many men and many officers i hear alex haskell and young mcmahan are among them as well as a son of dr trezevant very sad indeed we are fighting again today will let you know the result as soon as possible will be at home some time next week no letter from you yet with devotion yours james chesnut a telegram from my husband of june 29th from richmond was on the field saw it all things satisfying so far can hear nothing of john chesnut he is in stuart's command saw jack preston safe so far no reason why we should not bag mcclellan's army or cut it to pieces from four to six thousand prisoners already doctor gibbes rushed in like a whirlwind to say we were driving mcclellan into the river june 30th first came dr trezevant who announced burnet rhett's death no no i have just seen the bulletin board it was grimke rhett's when the doctor went out it was added howell trezevant's death is there too the doctor will see it as soon as he goes down to the board the girls went to see lucy trezevant the doctor was lying still as death on a sofa with his face covered
june 1st we have been to bloomsbury again and hear that william kirkland has been wounded a scene occurred then mary weeping bitterly and aunt b frantic as to tanny's danger i proposed to make arrangements for mary to go on at once the judge took me aside frowning angrily you are unwise to talk in that way she can neither take her infant nor leave it the cars are closed by order of the government to all but soldiers i told him of the woman who when the conductor said she could not go cried at the top of her voice soldiers i want to go to richmond to nurse my wounded husband in a moment twenty men made themselves her body guard and she went on unmolested the judge said i talked nonsense i said i would go on in my carriage if need be besides there would be no difficulty in getting mary a permit he answered hotly that in no case would he let her go and that i had better not go back into the house we were on the piazza and my carriage at the door i took it and crossed over to see mary boykin she was weeping too so washed away with tears one would hardly know her so many killed my son and my husband i do not hear a word from them gave to day for two pounds of tea forty pounds of coffee and sixty pounds of sugar 800 beauregard is a gentleman and was a genius as long as whiting did his engineering for him our creole general is not quite so clever as he thinks himself mary ford writes for school books for her boys she is in great distress on the subject when longstreet's corps passed through greenville there was great enthusiasm handkerchiefs were waved bouquets and flowers were thrown the troops her boys having nothing else to throw threw their school books
july 4th russell abuses us in his letters people here care a great deal for what russell says because he represents the london times and the times reflects the sentiment of the english people how we do cling to the idea of an alliance with england or france without france even washington could not have done it we drove to the camp to see the president present a flag to a maryland regiment having lived on the battlefield kirkwood near camden 1 we have an immense respect for the maryland line when our militia in that fight ran away colonel howard and the marylanders held their own against rawdon cornwallis and the rest and everywhere around are places named for a doughty captain killed in our defense kirkwood de kalb etc the last however was a prussian count a letter from my husband written june 22d has just reached me he says we are very strongly posted entrenched and have now at our command about 15,000 of the best troops in the world we have besides two batteries of artillery a regiment of cavalry and daily expect a battalion of flying artillery from richmond we have sent forward seven regiments of infantry and rifles toward alexandria our outposts have felt the enemy several times and in every instance the enemy recoils general johnston has had several encounters the advancing columns of the two armies and with him too the enemy although always superior in numbers are invariably driven back there is great deficiency in the matter of ammunition general johnston's command in the very face of overwhelming numbers have only thirty rounds each if they had been well provided in this respect they could and would have defeated cadwallader and paterson with great ease i find the opinion prevails throughout the army that there is great imbecility and shameful neglect in the war department unless the republicans fall back we must soon come together on both lines and have a decided engagement but the opinion prevails here that lincoln's army will not meet us if they can avoid it they have already fallen back before a slight check from 400 of johnston's men they had 700 and were badly beaten you have no idea how dirty and irksome the camp life is you would hardly know your best friend in camp guise noise of drums tramp of marching regiments all day long rattling of artillery wagons bands of music friends from every quarter coming in we ought to be miserable and anxious and yet these are pleasant days perhaps we are unnaturally exhilarated and excited heard some people in the drawing room say mrs davis's ladies are not young are not pretty and i am one of them the truthfulness of the remark did not tend to alleviate its bitterness we must put maggie howell and mary hammy in the foreground as youth and beauty are in request at least they are young things bright spots in a somber tinted picture the president does not forbid our going but he is very much averse to it we are consequently frightened by our own audacity but we are wilful women and so we go fauquier white sulphur springs va july 6 1861 mr brewster came here with us the cars were jammed with soldiers to the muzzle they were very polite and considerate and we had an agreeable journey in spite of heat dust and crowd rev robert barnwell was with us he means to organize a hospital for sick and wounded there was not an inch of standing room even so dusty so close but everybody in tip top spirits mr preston and mr chesnut met us at warrenton saw across the lawn but did not speak to them some of judge campbell's family there they wander disconsolate just outside the gates of their paradise a resigned judge of the supreme court of the united states resigned and for a cause that he is hardly more than half in sympathy with judge campbell's is one of the hardest cases july 7th this water is making us young again how these men enjoy the baths they say beauregard can stop the way with sixty thousand that many are coming an antique female with every hair curled and frizzed said to be a yankee spy sits opposite us brewster solemnly wondered with eternity and the judgment to come so near at hand how she could waste her few remaining minutes curling her hair he bade me be very polite for she would ask me questions when we were walking away from table i demanded his approval of my self control under such trying circumstances it seems i was not as calm and forbearing as i thought myself brewster answered with emphasis do you always carry brickbats like that in your pocket ready for the first word that offends you you must not do so when you are with spies from the other side i do not feel at all afraid of spies hearing anything through me for i do not know anything but our men could not tarry with us in these cool shades and comfortable quarters with water unlimited excellent table etc they have gone back to manassas and the faithful brewster with them to bring us the latest news they left us in excellent spirits which we shared until they were out of sight we went with them to warrenton and then heard that general johnston was in full retreat and that a column was advancing upon beauregard so we came back all forlorn if our husbands are taken prisoners what will they do with them are they soldiers or traitors mrs ould read us a letter from richmond how horrified they are there at joe johnston's retreating and the enemies of the war department accuse walker of not sending general johnston ammunition in sufficient quantities say that is the real cause of his retreat now will they not make the ears of that slow coach the secretary of war buzz mrs preston's maid maria has a way of rushing in don't you hear the cannon we fly to the windows lean out to our waists pull all the hair away from our ears but can not hear it lincoln wants four hundred millions of money and men in proportion can he get them he will find us a heavy handful midnight i hear maria's guns we are always picking up some good thing of the rough illinoisan's saying lincoln objects to some man oh he is too interruptious that is a horrid style of man or woman the interruptious i know the thing but had no name for it before july 9th our battle summer may it be our first and our last so called after all we have not had any of the horrors of war could there have been a gayer or pleasanter life than we led in charleston and montgomery how exciting it all was there so many clever men and women congregated from every part of the south mosquitoes and a want of neatness and a want of good things to eat drove us away in richmond the girls say it is perfectly delightful we found it so too but the bickering and quarreling have begun there at table to day we heard mrs davis's ladies described they were said to wear red frocks and flats on their heads we sat mute as mice one woman said she found the drawing room of the spotswood was warm stuffy and stifling poor soul murmured the inevitable brewster and no man came to air her in the moonlight stroll you know why didn't somebody ask her out on the piazza to see the comet heavens above what philandering was done in the name of the comet when you stumbled on a couple on the piazza they lifted their eyes and comet was the only word you heard brewster came back with a paper from washington with terrific threats of what they will do to us threatened men live long there was a soft sweet low and slow young lady opposite to us she seemed so gentle and refined and so uncertain of everything mr brewster called her miss albina mcclush who always asked her maid when a new book was mentioned seraphina have i perused that volume mary hammy having a fiancé in the wars is inclined at times to be sad and tearful mrs preston quoted her negro nurse to her never take any more trouble in your heart than you can kick off at the end of your toes july 11th we did hear cannon to day the woman who slandered mrs davis's republican court of which we are honorable members by saying they well were not young that they wore gaudy colors and dressed badly i took an inventory to day as to her charms she is darkly deeply beautifully freckled she wears a wig which is kept in place by a tiara of mock jewels she has the fattest of arms and wears black bead bracelets the one who is under a cloud shadowed as a yankee spy has confirmed our worst suspicions she exhibited unholy joy as she reported seven hundred sick soldiers in the hospital at culpeper and that beauregard had sent a flag of truce to washington what a night we had maria had seen suspicious persons hovering about all day and mrs preston a ladder which could easily be placed so as to reach our rooms mary hammy saw lights glancing about among the trees and we all heard guns so we sat up consequently i am writing in bed to day a letter from my husband saying in particular our orders are to move on the date july 10th here we are still and no more prospect of movement now than when i last wrote to you it is true however that the enemy is advancing slowly in our front and we are preparing to receive him he comes in great force being more than three times our number the spy so called gave us a parting shot said beauregard had arrested her brother in order that he might take a fine horse which the aforesaid brother was riding why beauregard at a moment's notice could have any horse in south carolina or louisiana for that matter this man was arrested and sent to richmond and will be acquitted as they always are said brewster they send them first to richmond to see and hear everything there then they acquit them and send them out of the country by way of norfolk to see everything there but after all what does it matter they have no need for spies our newspapers keep no secrets hid the thoughts of our hearts are all revealed everything with us is open and aboveboard at bethel the yankees fired too high every daily paper is jeering them about it yet they'll fire low enough next time but no newspaper man will be there to get the benefit of their improved practise alas richmond va july 13,1861 now we feel safe and comfortable we can not be flanked mr preston met us at warrenton mr chesnut doubtless had too many spies to receive from washington galloping in with the exact numbers of the enemy done up in their back hair wade hampton is here doctor nott also nott and glyddon known to fame everybody is here en route for the army or staying for the meeting of congress lamar is out on crutches his father in law once known only as the humorist longstreet 1 author of georgia scenes now a staid methodist who has outgrown the follies of his youth bore him off to day they say judge longstreet has lost the keen sense of fun that illuminated his life in days of yore mrs lamar and her daughter were here the president met us cordially but he laughed at our sudden retreat with baggage lost etc he tried to keep us from going said it was a dangerous experiment dare say he knows more about the situation of things than he chooses to tell us to day in the drawing room saw a vivandière in the flesh she was in the uniform of her regiment but wore turkish pantaloons she frisked about in her hat and feathers did not uncover her head as a man would have done played the piano and sang war songs she had no drum but she gave us rataplan she was followed at every step by a mob of admiring soldiers and boys yesterday as we left the cars we had a glimpse of war it was the saddest sight the memory of it is hard to shake off sick soldiers not wounded ones there were quite two hundred they said lying about as best they might on the platform robert barnwell1 was there doing all he could their pale ghastly faces so here is one of the horrors of war we had not reckoned on there were many good men and women with robert barnwell rendering all the service possible in the circumstances just now i happened to look up and saw mr chesnut with a smile on his face watching me from the passageway i flew across the room and as i got half way saw mrs davis touch him on the shoulder she said he was to go at once into mr davis's room where general lee and general cooper were after he left us mrs davis told me general beauregard had sent mr chesnut here on some army business july 14th mr chesnut remained closeted with the president and general lee all the afternoon the news does not seem pleasant at least he is not inclined to tell me any of it he satisfied himself with telling me how sensible and soldierly this handsome general lee is general lee's military sagacity was also his theme of course the president dominated the party as well by his weight of brain as by his position i did not care a fig for a description of the war council i wanted to know what is in the wind now july 16th dined to day at the president's table joe davis the nephew asked me if i liked white port wine i said i did not know all that i had ever known had been dark red so he poured me out a glass i drank it and it nearly burned up my mouth and throat it was horrid but i did not let him see how it annoyed me i pretended to be glad that any one found me still young enough to play off a practical joke upon me it was thirty years since i had thought of such a thing met colonel baldwin in the drawing room he pointed significantly to his confederate colonel's buttons and gray coat at the white sulphur last summer he was a union man to the last point how much have you changed besides your coat i was always true to our country he said she leaves me no choice now as far as i can make out beauregard sent mr chesnut to the president to gain permission for the forces of joe johnston and beauregard to join and united to push the enemy if possible over the potomac now every day we grow weaker and they stronger so we had better give a telling blow at once already we begin to cry out for more ammunition and already the blockade is beginning to shut it all out a young emory is here his mother writes him to go back her franklin blood certainly calls him with no uncertain sound to the northern side while his fatherland is wavering and undecided split in half by factions mrs wigfall says he is half inclined to go she wondered that he did not with a father in the enemy's army he will always be suspect here let the president and mrs davis do for him what they will i did not know there was such a bitter cry left in me but i wept my heart away to day when my husband went off things do look so black when he comes up here he rarely brings his body servant a negro man lawrence has charge of all mr chesnut's things watch clothes and two or three hundred gold pieces that lie in the tray of his trunk all these papers etc he tells lawrence to bring to me if anything happens to him but i said maybe he will pack off to the yankees and freedom with all that fiddlesticks he is not going to leave me for anybody else after all what can he ever be better than he is now a gentleman's gentleman he is within sound of the enemy's guns and when he gets to the other army he is free maria said of mr preston's man what he want with anything more ef he was free don't he live just as well as mars john do now mrs mclane mrs joe johnston mrs wigfall all came i am sure so many clever women could divert a soul in extremis the hampton legion all in a snarl about i forget what standing on their dignity i suppose i have come to detest a man who says my own personal dignity and self respect require i long to cry no need to respect yourself until you can make other people do it july 19th beauregard telegraphed yesterday they say to general johnston come down and help us or we shall be crushed by numbers the president telegraphed general johnston to move down to beauregard's aid at bull run bonham's brigade ewell's and longstreet's encountered the foe and repulsed him six hundred prisoners have been sent here i arose as the scriptures say and washed my face and anointed my head and went down stairs at the foot of them stood general cooper radiant one finger nervously arranging his shirt collar or adjusting his neck to it after his fashion he called out your south carolina man bonham has done a capital thing at bull run driven back the enemy if not defeated him with killed and prisoners etc etc clingman came to tell the particulars and colonel smith one of the trio with garnett mcclellan who were sent to europe to inspect and report on military matters poor garnett is killed there was cowardice or treachery on the part of natives up there or some of governor letcher's appointments to military posts i hear all these things said i do not understand but it was a fatal business mrs mclane says she finds we do not believe a word of any news unless it comes in this guise a great battle fought not one confederate killed enemy's loss in killed wounded and prisoners taken by us immense i was in hopes there would be no battle until mr chesnut was forced to give up his amateur aideship to come and attend to his regular duties in the congress keitt has come in he says bonham's battle was a skirmish of outposts joe davis jr said would heaven only send us a napoleon not one bit of use if heaven did walker would not give him a commission mrs davis and mrs joe johnston her dear lydia were in fine spirits the effect upon nous autres was evident we rallied visibly south carolina troops pass every day they go by with a gay step tom taylor and john rhett bowed to us from their horses as we leaned out of the windows such shaking of handkerchiefs we are forever at the windows it was not such a mere skirmish we took three rifled cannon and six hundred stands of arms mr davis has gone to manassas he did not let wigfall know he was going that ends the delusion of wigfall's aideship no mistake to day i was too ill to move out of my bed so they all sat in my room july 22d mrs davis came in so softly that i did not know she was here until she leaned over me and said a great battle has been fought 1 joe johnston led the right wing and beauregard the left wing of the army your husband is all right wade hampton is wounded colonel johnston of the legion killed so are colonel bee and colonel bartow kirby smith1 is wounded or killed i had no breath to speak she went on in that desperate calm way to which people betake themselves under the greatest excitement bartow rallying his men leading them into the hottest of the light died gallantly at the head of his regiment the president telegraphs me only that it is a great victory general cooper has all the other telegrams still i said nothing i was stunned then i was so grateful those nearest and dearest to me were safe still she then began in the same concentrated voice to read from a paper she held in her hand dead and dying cover the field sherman's battery taken lynchburg regiment cut to pieces three hundred of the legion wounded that got me up times were too wild with excitement to stay in bed we went into mrs preston's room and she made me lie down on her bed men women and children streamed in every living soul had a story to tell complete victory you heard everywhere we had been such anxious wretches the revulsion of feeling was almost too much to bear to day i met my friend mr hunter i was on my way to mrs bartow's room and begged him to call at some other time i was too tearful just then for a morning visit from even the most sympathetic person a woman from mrs bartow's country was in a fury because they had stopped her as she rushed to be the first to tell mrs bartow her husband was killed it having been decided that mrs davis should tell her poor thing she was found lying on her bed when mrs davis knocked come in she said when she saw it was mrs davis she sat up ready to spring to her feet but then there was something in mrs davis's pale face that took the life out of her she stared at mrs davis then sank back and covered her face as she asked is it bad news for me mrs davis did not speak is he killed afterward mrs bartow said to me as soon as i saw mrs davis's face i could not say one word i knew it all in an instant i knew it before i wrapped the shawl about my head maria mrs preston's maid furiously patriotic came into my room these colored people say it is printed in the papers here that the virginia people done it all now mars wade had so many of his men killed and he wounded it stands to reason that south carolina was no ways backward if there was ever anything plain that's plain tuesday witnessed for the first time a military funeral as that march came wailing up they say mrs bartow fainted the empty saddle and the led war horse we saw and heard it all and now it seems we are never out of the sound of the dead march in saul it comes and it comes until i feel inclined to close my ears and scream yesterday mrs singleton and ourselves sat on a bedside and mingled our tears for those noble spirits john darby theodore barker and james lowndes to day we find we wasted our grief they are not so much as wounded i dare say all the rest is true about them in the face of the enemy with flags in their hands leading their men but dr darby is a surgeon he is as likely to forget that as i am he is grandson of colonel thomson of the revolution called by way of pet name by his soldiers old danger thank heaven they are all quite alive and we will not cry next time until officially notified july 24th here mr chesnut opened my door and walked in out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh i had to ask no questions he gave me an account of the battle as he saw it walking up and down my room occasionally seating himself on a window sill but too restless to remain still many moments and told what regiments he was sent to bring up he took the orders to colonel jackson whose regiment stood so stock still under file that they were called a stone wall also they call beauregard eugene and johnston marlboro mr chesnut rode with lay's cavalry after the retreating enemy in the pursuit they following them until midnight then there came such a fall of rain rain such as is only known in semitropical lands in the drawing room colonel chesnut was the belle of the ball they crowded him so for news he was the first arrival that they could get at from the field of battle but the women had to give way to the dignitaries of the land who were as filled with curiosity as themselves mr barnwell mr hunter mr cobb captain ingraham etc wilmot de saussure says wilson of massachusetts a senator of the united states 1 came to manassas en route to richmond with his dancing shoes ready for a festive scene which was to celebrate a triumph the new york tribune said in a few days we shall have richmond memphis and new orleans they must be taken and at once for a few days maybe now they will modestly substitute in a few years they brought me a yankee soldier's portfolio from the battle field the letters had been franked by senator harlan 1 one might shed tears over some of the letters women wives and mothers are the same everywhere what a comfort the spelling was we had been willing to admit that their universal free school education had put them rank and file ahead of us literarily but these letters do not attest that fact the spelling is comically bad july 27th mrs davis's drawing room last night was brilliant and she was in great force outside a mob called for the president he did speak an old war horse who scents the battle fields from afar his enthusiasm was contagious they called for colonel chesnut and he gave them a capital speech too as public speakers say sometimes it was the proudest moment of my life i did not hear a great deal of it for always when anything happens of any moment my heart beats up in my ears but the distinguished carolinians who crowded round told me how good a speech he made i was dazed there goes the dead march for some poor soul to day the president told us at dinner that mr chesnut's eulogy of bartow in the congress was highly praised men liked it two eminently satisfactory speeches in twenty four hours is doing pretty well and now i could be happy but this cabinet of ours are in such bitter quarrels among themselves everybody abusing everybody last night while those splendid descriptions of the battle were being given to the crowd below from our windows i said then why do we not go on to washington you mean why did they not the opportunity is lost mr barnwell said to me silence we want to listen to the speaker and mr hunter smiled compassionately don't ask awkward questions kirby smith came down on the turnpike in the very nick of time still the heroes who fought all day and held the yankees in check deserve credit beyond words or it would all have been over before the joe johnston contingent came it is another case of the eleventh hour scrape the eleventh hour men claim all the credit and they who bore the heat and brunt and burden of the day do not like that everybody said at first pshaw there will be no war those who foresaw evil were called ravens ill foreboders now the same sanguine people all cry the war is over the very same who were packing to leave richmond a few days ago many were ready to move on at a moment's warning when the good news came there are such owls everywhere but to revert to the other kind the sage and circumspect those who say very little but that little shows they think the war barely begun mr rives and mr seddon have just called arnoldus van der horst came to see me at the same time he said there was no great show of victory on our side until two o'clock but when we began to win we did it in double quick time i mean of course the battle last sunday arnold harris told mr wigfall the news from washington last sunday for hours the telegrams reported at rapid intervals great victory defeating them at all points the couriers began to come in on horseback and at last after two or three o'clock there was a sudden cessation of all news about nine messengers with bulletins came on foot or on horseback wounded weary draggled footsore panic stricken spreading in their path on every hand terror and dismay that was our opportunity wigfall can see nothing that could have stopped us and when they explain why we did not go to washington i understand it all less than ever yet here we will dilly dally and congress orate and generals parade until they in the north get up an army three times as large as mcdowell's which we have just defeated trescott says this victory will be our ruin it lulls us into a fool's paradise of conceit at our superior valor and the shameful farce of their flight will wake every inch of their manhood it was the very fillip they needed there are a quieter sort here who know their yankees well they say if the thing begins to pay government contracts and all that we will never hear the end of it at least until they get their pay in some way out of us they will not lose money by us of that we may be sure trust yankee shrewdness and vim for that there seems to be a battle raging at bethel but no mortal here can be got to think of anything but manassas mrs mclean says she does not see that it was such a great victory and if it be so great how can one defeat hurt a nation like the north john waties fought the whole battle over for me now i understand it before this nobody would take the time to tell the thing consecutively rationally and in order mr venable said he did not see a braver thing done than the cool performance of a columbia negro he carried his master a bucket of ham and rice which he had cooked for him and he cried you must be so tired and hungry marster make haste and eat this was in the thickest of the fight under the heaviest of the enemy's guns the federal congressmen had been making a picnic of it their luggage was all ticketed to richmond cameron has issued a proclamation they are making ready to come after us on a magnificent scale they acknowledge us at last foemen worthy of their steel the lord help us since england and france won't or don't if we could only get a friend outside and open a port one of these men told me he had seen a yankee prisoner who asked him what sort of a diggins richmond was for trade he was tired of the old concern and would like to take the oath and settle here they brought us handcuffs found in the débacle of the yankee army for whom were they jeff davis no doubt and the ringleaders tell that to the marines we have outgrown the handcuff business on this side of the water dr gibbes says he was at a country house near manassas when a federal soldier who had lost his way came in exhausted he asked for brandy which the lady of the house gave him upon second thought he declined it she brought it to him so promptly he said he thought it might be poisoned his mind was she was enraged and said sir i am a virginia woman do you think i could be as base as that here bill tom disarm this man he is our prisoner the negroes came running and the man surrendered without more ado another federal was drinking at the well a negro girl said you go in and see missis the man went in and she followed crying triumphantly look here missis i got a prisoner too this lady sent in her two prisoners and beauregard complimented her on her pluck and patriotism and her presence of mind these negroes were rewarded by their owners now if slavery is as disagreeable to negroes as we think it why don't they all march over the border where they would be received with open arms it all amazes me i am always studying these creatures they are to me inscrutable in their way and past finding out our negroes were not ripe for john brown this is how i saw robert e lee for the first time though his family then living at arlington called to see me while i was in washington i thought because of old colonel chesnut's intimacy with nellie custis in the old philadelphia days mrs lee being nelly custis's niece i had not known the head of the lee family he was somewhere with the army then last summer at the white sulphur were roony lee and his wife that sweet little charlotte wickam and i spoke of roony with great praise mrs izard said don't waste your admiration on him wait till you see his father he is the nearest to a perfect man i ever saw how in every way handsome clever agreeable high bred now mrs stanard came for mrs preston and me to drive to the camp in an open carriage a man riding a beautiful horse joined us he wore a hat with something of a military look to it sat his horse gracefully and was so distinguished at all points that i very much regretted not catching his name as mrs stanard gave it to us he however heard ours and bowed as gracefully as he rode and the few remarks he made to each of us showed he knew all about us but mrs stanard was in ecstasies of pleasurable excitement i felt that she had bagged a big fish for just then they abounded in richmond mrs stanard accused him of being ambitious etc he remonstrated and said his tastes were of the simplest he only wanted a virginia farm no end of cream and fresh butter and fried chicken not one fried chicken or two but unlimited fried chicken to all this light chat did we seriously incline because the man and horse and everything about him were so fine looking perfection in fact no fault to be found if you hunted for it as he left us i said eagerly who is he you did not know why it was robert e lee son of light horse harry lee the first man in virginia raising her voice as she enumerated his glories all the same i like smith lee better and i like his looks too i know smith lee well can anybody say they know his brother i doubt it he looks so cold quiet and grand kirby smith is our blücher he came on the field in the nick of time as blücher at waterloo and now we are as the british who do not remember blücher it is all wellington so every individual man i see fought and won the battle from kershaw up and down all the eleventh hour men won the battle turned the tide the marylanders elzey co one never hears of as little as one hears of blücher in the english stories of waterloo mr venable was praising hugh garden and kershaw's regiment generally this was delightful they are my friends and neighbors at home i showed him mary stark's letter and we agreed with her at the bottom of our hearts we believe every confederate soldier to be a hero sans peur et sans reproche hope for the best to day things must be on a pleasanter footing all over the world met the president in the corridor he took me by both hands have you breakfasted said he come in and breakfast with me alas i had had my breakfast at the public dining room where i had taken my breakfast with mr chesnut mrs davis came to him while we were at table she said she had been to our rooms she wanted wigfall hunted up mr davis thought chesnut would be apt to know his whereabouts i ran to mrs wigfall's room who told me she was sure he could be found with his regiment in camp but mr chesnut had not to go to the camp for wigfall came to his wife's room while i was there mr davis and wigfall would be friends if if the northern papers say we hung and quartered a zouave cut him into four pieces and that we tie prisoners to a tree and bayonet them in other words we are savages it ought to teach us not to credit what our papers say of them it is so absurd an imagination of evil we are absolutely treating their prisoners as well as our own men we are complained of for it here i am going to the hospitals for the enemy's sick and wounded in order to see for myself why did we not follow the flying foe across the potomac that is the question of the hour in the drawing room with those of us who are not contending as to who took rickett's battery allen green for one took it allen told us that finding a portmanteau with nice clean shirts he was so hot and dusty he stepped behind a tree and put on a clean yankee shirt and was more comfortable the new york tribune soothes the yankee self conceit which has received a shock by saying we had 100,000 men on the field at manassas we had about 15,000 effective men in all and then the tribune tries to inflame and envenom them against us by telling lies as to our treatment of prisoners they say when they come against us next it will be in overwhelming force i long to see russell's letter to the london times about bull run and manassas it will be rich and rare in washington it is crimination and recrimination well let them abuse one another to their hearts content august 1st mrs wigfall with the lone star flag in her carriage called for me we drove to the fair grounds mrs davis's landau with her spanking bays rolled along in front of us the fair grounds are as covered with tents soldiers etc as ever as one regiment moves off to the army a fresh one from home comes to be mustered in and take its place the president with his aides dashed by my husband was riding with him the president presented the flag to the texans mr chesnut came to us for the flag and bore it aloft to the president we seemed to come in for part of the glory we were too far off to hear the speech but jeff davis is very good at that sort of thing and we were satisfied that it was well done heavens how that redoubtable wigfall did rush those poor texans about he maneuvered and marched them until i was weary for their sakes poor fellows it was a hot afternoon in august and the thermometer in the nineties mr davis uncovered to speak wigfall replied with his hat on is that military at the fair grounds to day such music mustering and marching such cheering and flying of flags such firing of guns and all that sort of thing a gala day it was with double distilled fourth of july feeling in the midst of it all a messenger came to tell mrs wigfall that a telegram had been received saying her children were safe across the lines in gordonsville that was something to thank god for without any doubt these two little girls came from somewhere in connecticut with mrs wigfall's sister the one who gave me my bogotsky the only person in the world except susan rutledge who ever seemed to think i had a soul to save now suppose seward had held louisa and fanny as hostages for louis wigfall's good behavior eh excitement number two that bold brigadier the georgia general toombs charging about too recklessly got thrown his horse dragged him up to the wheels of our carriage for a moment it was frightful down there among the horses hoofs was a face turned up toward us purple with rage his foot was still in the stirrup and he had not let go the bridle the horse was prancing over him tearing and plunging everybody was hemming him in and they seemed so slow and awkward about it we felt it an eternity looking down at him and expecting him to be killed before our very faces however he soon got it all straight and though awfully tousled and tumbled dusty rumpled and flushed with redder face and wilder hair than ever he rode off gallantly having to our admiration bravely remounted the recalcitrant charger now if i were to pick out the best abused one where all catch it so bountifully i should say mr commissary general northrop was the most cussed and villified man in the confederacy he is held accountable for everything that goes wrong in the army he may not be efficient but having been a classmate and crony of jeff davis at west point points the moral and adorns the tale i hear that alluded to oftenest of his many crimes they say beauregard writes that his army is upon the verge of starvation here every man woman and child is ready to hang to the first lamp post anybody of whom that army complains every manassas soldier is a hero dear to our patriotic hearts put up with any neglect of the heroes of the 21st july never and now they say we did not move on right after the flying foe because we had no provisions no wagons no ammunition etc rain mud and northrop where were the enemy's supplies that we bragged so of bagging echo answers where where there is a will there is a way we stopped to plunder that rich convoy and somehow for a day or so everybody thought the war was over and stopped to rejoice so it appeared here all this was our dinner table talk to day mr mason dined with us and mr barnwell sits by me always the latter reproved me sharply but mr mason laughed at this headlong unreasonable woman's harangue and female tactics and their war ways a freshet in the autumn does not compensate for a drought in the spring time and tide wait for no man and there was a tide in our affairs which might have led to washington and we did not take it and lost our fortune this round things which nobody could deny mcclellan virtually supersedes the titan scott physically general scott is the largest man i ever saw mrs scott said nobody but his wife could ever know how little he was and yet they say old winfield scott could have organized an army for them if they had had patience they would not give him time
july 1st no more news it has settled down into this the general battle the decisive battle has to be fought yet edward cheves only son of john cheves killed his sister kept crying oh mother what shall we do edward is killed but the mother sat dead still white as a sheet never uttering a word or shedding a tear are our women losing the capacity to weep the father came to day mr john cheves he has been making infernal machines in charleston to blow up yankee ships while mrs mccord was telling me of this terrible trouble in her brother's family some one said decca's husband died of grief stuff and nonsense silly sentiment folly if he is not wounded he is alive his brother john may die of that shattered arm in this hot weather alex will never die of a broken heart take my word for it july 3d mem says she feels like sitting down as an irishwoman does at a wake and howling night and day why did huger let mcclellan slip through his fingers arrived at mrs mcmahan's at the wrong moment mrs bartow was reading to the stricken mother an account of the death of her son the letter was written by a man who was standing by him when he was shot through the head my god he said that was all and he fell dead james taylor was color bearer he was shot three times before he gave in then he said as he handed the colors to the man next him you see i can't stand it any longer and dropped stone dead he was only seventeen years old if anything can reconcile me to the idea of a horrid failure after all efforts to make good our independence of yankees it is lincoln's proclamation freeing the negroes especially yours messieurs who write insults to your governor and council dated from clarendon three hundred of mr walter blake's negroes have gone to the yankees remember that recalcitrant patriot's property on two legs may walk off without an order from the council to work on fortifications have been reading the potiphar papers by curtis can this be a picture of new york socially if it were not for this horrid war how nice it would be here we might lead such a pleasant life this is the most perfectly appointed establishment such beautiful grounds lowers and fruits indeed all that heart could wish such delightful dinners such pleasant drives such jolly talks such charming people but this horrid war poisons everything july 5th drove out with mrs constitution browne who told us the story of ben mcculloch's devotion to lucy gwynn poor ben mcculloch another dead hero called at the tognos and saw no one no wonder they say ascelie togno was to have been married to grimke rhett in august and he is dead on the battle field i had not heard of the engagement before i went there july 8th gunboat captured on the santee so much the worse for us we do not want any more prisoners and next time they will send a fleet of boats if one will not do the governor sent me mr chesnut's telegram with a note saying i regret the telegram does not come up to what we had hoped might be as to the entire destruction of mcclellan's army i think however the strength of the war with its ferocity may now be considered as broken table talk to day this war was undertaken by us to shake off the yoke of foreign invaders so we consider our cause righteous the yankees since the war has begun have discovered it is to free the slaves that they are fighting so their cause is noble they also expect to make the war pay yankees do not undertake anything that does not pay they think we belong to them we have been good milk cows milked by the tariff or skimmed we let them have all of our hard earnings we bear the ban of slavery they get the money cotton pays everybody who handles it sells it manufactures it but rarely pays the man who grows it second hand the yankees received the wages of slavery they grew rich we grew poor the receiver is as bad as the thief that applies to us too for we received the savages they stole from africa and brought to us in their slave ships as with the egyptians so it shall be with us if they let us go it must be across a red sea but one made red by blood july 10th my husband has come he believes from what he heard in richmond that we are to be recognized as a nation by the crowned heads across the water at last mr davis was very kind he asked him to stay at his house which he did and went every day with general lee and mr davis to the battle field as a sort of amateur aide to the president likewise they admitted him to the informal cabinet meetings at the president's house he is so hopeful now that it is pleasant to hear him and i had not the heart to stick the small pins of yeadon and pickens in him yet a while public opinion is hot against huger and magruder for mcclellan's escape doctor gibbes gave me some letters picked up on the battle field one signed laura tells her lover to fight in such a manner that no southerner can ever taunt yankees again with cowardice she speaks of a man at home whom she knows who is still talking of his intention to seek the bubble reputation at the cannon's mouth miserable coward she writes i will never speak to him again it was a relief to find one silly young person filling three pages with a description of her new bonnet and the bonnet still worn by her rival those fiery joan of arc damsels who goad on their sweethearts bode us no good rachel lyons was in richmond hand in glove with mrs greenhow why not so handsome so clever so angelically kind says rachel of the greenhow and she offers to matronize me mrs philips another beautiful and clever jewess has been put into prison again by beast butler because she happened to be laughing as a yankee funeral procession went by captain b told of john chesnut's pranks johnny was riding a powerful horse captured from the yankees the horse dashed with him right into the yankee ranks a dozen confederates galloped after him shouting stuart stuart the yankees mistaking this mad charge for stuart's cavalry broke ranks and fled daredevil camden boys ride like arabs mr chesnut says he was riding with the president when colonel browne his aide was along the general commanding rode up and bowing politely said mr president am i in command here yes then i forbid you to stand here under the enemy's guns any exposure of a life like yours is wrong and this is useless exposure you must go back mr davis answered certainly i will set an example of obedience to orders discipline must be maintained but he did not go back mr chesnut met the haynes who had gone on to nurse their wounded son and found him dead they were standing in the corridor of the spotswood although mr chesnut was staying at the president's he retained his room at the hotel so he gave his room to them next day when he went back to his room he found that mrs hayne had thrown herself across the foot of the bed and never moved no other part of the bed had been touched she got up and went back to the cars or was led back he says these heartbroken mothers are hard to face july 12th at mcmahan's our small colonel paul hayne's son came into my room to amuse the child i gave him a photograph album to look over you have lincoln in your book said he i am astonished at you i hate him and he placed the book on the floor and struck old abe in the face with his fist an englishman told me lincoln has said that had he known such a war would follow his election he never would have set foot in washington nor have been inaugurated he had never dreamed of this awful fratricidal bloodshed that does not seem like the true john brown spirit i was very glad to hear it to hear something from the president of the united states which was not merely a vulgar joke and usually a joke so vulgar that you were ashamed to laugh funny though it was they say seward has gone to england and his wily tongue will turn all hearts against us browne told us there was a son of the duke of somerset in richmond he laughed his fill at our ragged dirty soldiers but he stopped his laughing when he saw them under fire our men strip the yankee dead of their shoes but will not touch the shoes of a comrade poor fellows they are nearly barefoot alex has come i saw him ride up about dusk and go into the graveyard i shut up my windows on that side poor fellow july 13th halcott green came to see us bragg is a stern disciplinarian according to halcott he did not in the least understand citizen soldiers in the retreat from shiloh he ordered that not a gun should be fired a soldier shot a chicken and then the soldier was shot for a chicken said halcott a confederate soldier for a chicken mrs mccord says a nurse who is also a beauty had better leave her beauty with her cloak and hat at the door one lovely lady nurse said to a rough old soldier whose wound could not have been dangerous well my good soul what can i do for you kiss me said he mrs mccord's fury was at the woman's telling it for it brought her hospital into disrepute and very properly she knew there were women who would boast of an insult if it ministered to their vanity she wanted nurses to come dressed as nurses as sisters of charity and not as fine ladies then there would be no trouble when she saw them coming in angel sleeves displaying all their white arms and in their muslin showing all their beautiful white shoulders and throats she felt disposed to order them off the premises that was no proper costume for a nurse mrs bartow goes in her widow's weeds which is after mrs mccord's own heart but mrs bartow has her stories too a surgeon said to her i give you no detailed instructions a mother necessarily is a nurse she then passed on quietly as smilingly acquiescent my dear as if i had ever been a mother mrs greenhow has enlightened rachel lyons as to mr chesnut's character in washington he was one of the very few men of whom there was not a word of scandal spoken i do not believe my dear that he ever spoke to a woman there he did know mrs john r thompson however walked up and down the college campus with mrs mccord the buildings all lit up with gas the soldiers seated under the elms in every direction and in every stage of convalescence through the open windows could see the nurses flitting about it was a strange weird scene walked home with mrs bartow we stopped at judge carroll's mrs carroll gave us a cup of tea when we got home found the prestons had called for me to dine at their house to meet general magruder last night the edgefield band serenaded governor pickens mrs harris stepped on the porch and sang the marseillaise for them it has been more than twenty years since i first heard her voice it was a very fine one then but there is nothing which the tooth of time lacerates more cruelly than the singing voice of women there is an incongruous metaphor for you the negroes on the coast received the rutledge's mounted rifles apparently with great rejoicings the troops were gratified to find the negroes in such a friendly state of mind one servant whispered to his master don't you mind em don't trust em meaning the negroes the master then dressed himself as a federal officer and went down to a negro quarter the very first greeting was ki massa you come fuh ketch rebels we kin show you way you kin ketch thirty to night they took him to the confederate camp or pointed it out and then added for his edification we kin ketch officer fuh you whenever you want em bad news gunboats have passed vicksburg the yankees are spreading themselves over our fair southern land like red ants july 21st jackson has gone into the enemy's country joe johnston and wade hampton are to follow think of rice mr senator rice 1 who sent us the buffalo robes i see from his place in the senate that he speaks of us as savages who put powder and whisky into soldiers canteens to make them mad with ferocity in the fight no never we admire coolness here because we lack it we do not need to be fired by drink to be brave my classical lore is small indeed but i faintly remember something of the spartans who marched to the music of lutes no drum and fife were needed to revive their fainting spirits in that one thing we are spartans the wayside hospital2 is duly established at the columbia station where all the railroads meet all honor to mrs fisher and the other women who work there so faithfully the young girls of columbia started this hospital in the first winter of the war moneyless soldiers sick and wounded suffered greatly when they had to lie over here because of faulty connections between trains rev mr martin whose habit it was to meet trains and offer his aid to these unfortunates suggested to the young ladies hospital association their opportunity straightway the blessed maidens provided a room where our poor fellows might have their wounds bound up and be refreshed and now the soldiers rest has grown into the wayside hospital and older heads and hands relieve younger ones of the grimmer work and graver responsibilities i am ready to help in every way by subscription and otherwise but too feeble in health to go there much mrs browne heard a man say at the congaree house we are breaking our heads against a stone wall we are bound to be conquered we can not keep it up much longer against so powerful a nation as the united states crowds of irish dutch and scotch are pouring in to swell their armies they are promised our lands and they believe they will get them even if we are successful we can not live without yankees now says mrs browne i call that man a yankee spy to which i reply if he were a spy he would not dare show his hand so plainly to think says mrs browne that he is not taken up seward's little bell would tinkle a guard would come and the grand inquisition of america would order that man put under arrest in the twinkling of an eye if he had ventured to speak against yankees in yankee land general preston said he had the right to take up any one who was not in his right place and send him where he belonged then do take up my husband instantly he is sadly out of his right place in this little governor's council the general stared at me and slowly uttered in his most tragic tones if i could put him where i think he ought to be this i immediately hailed as a high compliment and was duly ready with my thanks upon reflection it is borne in upon me that he might have been more explicit he left too much to the imagination then mrs browne described the prince of wales whose manners it seems differ from those of mrs who arraigned us from morn to dewy eve and upbraided us with our ill bred manners and customs the prince when he was here conformed at once to whatever he saw was the way of those who entertained him he closely imitated president buchanan's way of doing things he took off his gloves at once when he saw that the president wore none he began by bowing to the people who were presented to him but when he saw mr buchanan shaking hands he shook hands too when smoking affably with browne on the white house piazza he expressed his content with the fine cigars browne had given him the president said i was keeping some excellent ones for you but browne has got ahead of me long after mr buchanan had gone to bed the prince ran into his room in a jolly boyish way and said mr buchanan i have come for the fine cigars you have for me as i walked up to the prestons along a beautiful shaded back street a carriage passed with governor means in it as soon as he saw me he threw himself half out and kissed both hands to me again and again it was a whole souled greeting as the saying is and i returned it with my whole heart too good by he cried and i responded good by i may never see him again i am not sure that i did not shed a few tears general preston and mr chesnut were seated on the piazza of the hampton house as i walked in i opened my batteries upon them in this scornful style you cold formal solemn overly polite creatures weighed down by your own dignity you will never know the rapture of such a sad farewell as john means and i have just interchanged he was in a hack i proceeded to relate and i was on the sidewalk he was on his way to the war poor fellow the hackman drove steadily along in the middle of the street but for our gray hairs i do not know what he might have thought of us john means did not suppress his feelings at an unexpected meeting with an old friend and a good cry did me good it is a life of terror and foreboding we lead my heart is in my mouth half the time but you two under no possible circumstances could you forget your manners read russell's india all day saintly folks those english when their blood is up sepoys and blacks we do not expect anything better from but what an example of christian patience and humanity the white angels from the west set them the beautiful jewess rachel lyons was here to day she flattered paul hayne audaciously and he threw back the ball to day i saw the rowena to this rebecca when mrs edward barnwell called she is the purest type of anglo saxon exquisitely beautiful cold quiet calm lady like fair as a lily with the blackest and longest eyelashes and her eyes so light in color some one said they were the hue of cologne and water at any rate she has a patent right to them there are no more like them to be had the effect is startling but lovely beyond words blanton duncan told us a story of morgan in kentucky morgan walked into a court where they were trying some secessionists the judge was about to pronounce sentence but morgan rose and begged that he might be allowed to call some witnesses the judge asked who were his witnesses my name is john morgan and my witnesses are 1,400 confederate soldiers mrs izard witnessed two instances of patriotism in the caste called sandhill lackeys one forlorn chill and fever freckled creature yellow dirty and dry as a nut was selling peaches at ten cents a dozen soldiers collected around her cart she took the cover off and cried eat away eat your fill i never charge our soldiers anything they tried to make her take pay but when she steadily refused it they cheered her madly and said sleep in peace now we will fight for you and keep off the yankees another poor sandhill man refused to sell his cows and gave them to the hospital
july 8 1863 my mother ill at her home on the plantation near here where i have come to see her but to go back first to my trip home from flat rock to camden at the station i saw men sitting on a row of coffins smoking talking and laughing with their feet drawn up tailor fashion to keep them out of the wet thus does war harden people's hearts met james chesnut at wilmington he only crossed the river with me and then went back to richmond he was violently opposed to sending our troops into pennsylvania wanted all we could spare sent west to make an end there of our enemies he kept dark about vallandigham 1 i am sure we could not trust him to do us any good or to do the yankees any harm the coriolanus business is played out as we came to camden molly sat by me in the cars she touched me and with her nose in the air said look missis there was the inevitable bride and groom at least so i thought and the irrepressible kissing and lolling against each other which i had seen so often before i was rather astonished at molly's prudery but there was a touch in this scene which was new the man required for his peace of mind that the girl should brush his cheek with those beautiful long eyelashes of hers molly became so outraged in her blue black modesty that she kept her head out of the window not to see when we were detained at a little wayside station this woman made an awful row about her room she seemed to know me and appealed to me said her brother in law was adjutant to colonel k etc molly observed you had better go yonder ma'am where your husband is calling you the woman drew herself up proudly and with a toss exclaimed husband indeed i'm a widow that is my cousin i loved my dear husband too well to marry again ever ever absolutely tears came into her eyes molly loaded as she was with shawls and bundles stood motionless and said after all that gwine on in the kyars o lord i should a let it go twas my husband and me nigger as i am here i was at home on a soft bed with every physical comfort but life is one long catechism there due to the curiosity of stay at home people in a narrow world in richmond molly and lawrence quarreled he declared he could not put up with her tantrums unfortunately i asked him in the interests of peace and a quiet house to bear with her temper i did said i but she was so good and useful he was shabby enough to tell her what i had said at their next quarrel the awful reproaches she overwhelmed me with then she said she was mortified that i had humbled her before lawrence but the day of her revenge came at negro balls in richmond guests were required to carry passes and in changing his coat lawrence forgot his pass next day lawrence was missing and molly came to me laughing to tears come and look said she here is the fine gentleman tied between two black niggers and marched off to jail she laughed and jeered so she could not stand without holding on to the window lawrence disregarded her and called to me at the top of his voice please ma'am ask mars jeems to come take me out of this i ain't done nothin as soon as mr chesnut came home i told him of lawrence's sad fall and he went at once to his rescue there had been a fight and a disturbance at the ball the police had been called in and when every negro was required to show his pass lawrence had been taken up as having none he was terribly chopfallen when he came home walking behind mr chesnut he is always so respectable and well behaved and stands on his dignity i went over to mrs preston's at columbia camden had become simply intolerable to me there the telegram found me saying i must go to my mother who was ill at her home here in alabama colonel goodwyn his wife and two daughters were going and so i joined the party i telegraphed mr chesnut for lawrence and he replied forbidding me to go at all it was so hot the cars so disagreeable fever would be the inevitable result miss kate hampton in her soft voice said the only trouble in life is when one can't decide in which way duty leads once know your duty then all is easy i do not know whether she thought it my duty to obey my husband but i thought it my duty to go to my mother as i risked nothing but myself we had two days of an exciting drama under our very noses before our eyes a party had come to columbia who said they had run the blockade had come in by flag of truce etc colonel goodwyn asked me to look around and see if i could pick out the suspected crew it was easily done we were all in a sadly molting condition we had come to the end of our good clothes in three years and now our only resource was to turn them upside down or inside out and in mending darning patching etc near me on the train to alabama sat a young woman in a traveling dress of bright yellow she wore a profusion of curls had pink cheeks was delightfully airy and easy in her manner and was absorbed in a flirtation with a confederate major who in spite of his nice new gray uniform and two stars had a very yankee face fresh clean cut sharp utterly unsunburned florid wholesome handsome what more in compliment can one say of one's enemies two other women faced this man and woman and we knew them to be newcomers by their good clothes one of these women was a german she it was who had betrayed them i found that out afterward the handsomest of the three women had a hard northern face but all were in splendid array as to feathers flowers lace and jewelry if they were spies why were they so foolish as to brag of new york and compare us unfavorably with the other side all the time and in loud shrill accents surely that was not the way to pass unnoticed in the confederacy a man came in stood up and read from a paper the surrender of vicksburg 1 i felt as if i had been struck a hard blow on the top of my head and my heart took one of its queer turns i was utterly unconscious not long i dare say the first thing i heard was exclamations of joy and exultation from the overdressed party my rage and humiliation were great a man within earshot of this party had slept through everything he had a greyhound face eager and inquisitive when awake but now he was as one of the seven sleepers colonel goodwyn wrote on a blank page of my book one of de quincey's the note is there now that the sleeper was a richmond detective finally hot and tired out we arrived at west point on the chattahoochee river the dusty cars were quite still except for the giggling flirtation of the yellow gown and her major two confederate officers walked in i felt mischief in the air one touched the smart major who was whispering to yellow gown the major turned quickly instantly every drop of blood left his face a spasm seized his throat it was a piteous sight and at once i was awfully sorry for him he was marched out of the car poor yellow gown's color was fast but the whites of her eyes were lurid of the three women spies we never heard again they never do anything worse to women the high minded confederates than send them out of the country but when we read soon afterward of the execution of a male spy we thought of the major at montgomery the boat waited for us and in my haste i tumbled out of the omnibus with dr robert johnson's assistance but nearly broke my neck the thermometer was high up in the nineties and they gave me a stateroom over the boiler i paid out my confederate rags of money freely to the maid in order to get out of that oven surely go where we may hereafter an alabama steamer in august lying under the bluff with the sun looking down will give one a foretaste almost an adequate idea of what's to come as far as heat goes the planks of the floor burned one's feet under the bluff at selma where we stayed nearly all day i do not know why met james boykin who had lost 1,200 bales of cotton at vicksburg and charged it all to jeff davis in his wrath which did not seem exactly reasonable to me at portland there was a horse for james boykin and he rode away promising to have a carriage sent for me at once but he had to go seven miles on horseback before he reached my sister sally's and then sally was to send few or none in my heart i knew my husband was right when he forbade me to undertake this journey there was one living thing at this little riverside inn a white man who had a store opposite and oh how drunk he was hot as it was molly kept up a fire of pine knots there was neither lamp nor candle in that deserted house the drunken man reeled over now and then lantern in hand he would stand with his idiotic drunken glare or go solemnly staggering round us but always bowing in his politeness he nearly fell over us but i sprang out of his way as he asked well madam what can i do for you shall i ever forget the headache of that night and the fright my temples throbbed with dumb misery i sat upon a chair molly on the floor with her head resting against my chair she was as near as she could get to me and i kept my hand on her missis said she now i do believe you are scared scared of that poor drunken thing if he was sober i could whip him in a fair fight and drunk as he is i kin throw him over the banister ef he so much as teches you i don't value him a button taking heart from such brave words i laughed it seemed an eternity but the carriage came by ten o'clock and then with the coachman as our sole protector we poor women drove eight miles or more over a carriage road through long lanes swamps of pitchy darkness with plantations on every side the house as we drew near looked like a graveyard in a nightmare so vague and phantom like were its outlines i found my mother ill in bed feeble still but better than i hoped to see her i knew you would come was her greeting with outstretched hands then i went to bed in that silent house a house of the dead it seemed i supposed i was not to see my sister until the next day but she came in some time after i had gone to bed she kissed me quietly without a tear she was thin and pale but her voice was calm and kind as she lifted the candle over her head to show me something on the wall i saw that her pretty brown hair was white it was awfully hard not to burst out into violent weeping she looked so sweet and yet so utterly brokenhearted but as she was without emotion apparently it would not become me to upset her by my tears next day at noon hetty mother's old maid brought my breakfast to my bedside such a breakfast it was delmonico could do no better it is ever so late i know to which hetty replied yes we would not let molly wake you what a splendid cook you have here my daughter tenah is miss sally's cook she's well enough as times go but when our miss mary comes to see us i does it myself and she courtesied down to the floor bless your old soul i cried and she rushed over and gave me a good hug she is my mother's factotum has been her maid since she was six years old when she was bought from a virginia speculator along with her own mother and all her brothers and sisters she has been pampered until she is a rare old tyrant at times she can do everything better than any one else and my mother leans on her heavily hetty is dick's wife dick is the butler they have over a dozen children and take life very easily sally came in before i was out of bed and began at once in the same stony way pale and cold as ice to tell me of the death of her children it had happened not two weeks before her eyes were utterly without life no expression whatever and in a composed and sad sort of manner she told the tale as if it were something she had read and wanted me to hear my eldest daughter mary had grown up to be a lovely girl she was between thirteen and fourteen you know baby kate had my sister's gray eyes she was evidently to be the beauty of the family strange it is that here was one of my children who has lived and has gone and you have never seen her at all she died first and i would not go to the funeral i thought it would kill me to see her put under the ground i was lying down stupid with grief when aunt charlotte came to me after the funeral with this news mary has that awful disease too there was nothing to say i got up and dressed instantly and went to mary i did not leave her side again in that long struggle between life and death i did everything for her with my own hands i even prepared my darling for the grave i went to her funeral and i came home and walked straight to my mother and i begged her to be comforted i would bear it all without one word if god would only spare me the one child left me now sally has never shed a tear but has grown twenty years older cold hard careworn with the same rigidity of manner she began to go over all the details of mary's illness i had not given up hope no not at all as i sat by her side she said mamma put your hand on my knees they are so cold i put my hand on her knee the cold struck to my heart i knew it was the coldness of death sally put out her hand on me and it seemed to recall the feeling she fell forward in an agony of weeping that lasted for hours the doctor said this reaction was a blessing without it she must have died or gone mad while the mother was so bitterly weeping the little girl the last of them a bright child of three or four crawled into my bed now auntie she whispered i want to tell you all about mamie and katie but they watch me so they say i must never talk about them katie died because she ate blackberries i know that and then aunt charlotte read mamie a letter and that made her die too maum hetty says they have gone to god but i know the people saved a place between them in the ground for me uncle william was in despair at the low ebb of patriotism out here west of the savannah river said he it is property first life next honor last he gave me an excellent pair of shoes what a gift for more than a year i have had none but some dreadful things armstead makes for me and they hurt my feet so these do not fit but that is nothing they are large enough and do not pinch anywhere i have absolutely a respectable pair of shoes uncle william says the men who went into the war to save their negroes are abjectly wretched neither side now cares a fig for these beloved negroes and would send them all to heaven in a hand basket as custis lee says to win in the fight general lee and mr davis want the negroes put into the army mr chesnut and major venable discussed the subject one night but would they fight on our side or desert to the enemy they don't go to the enemy because they are comfortable as they are and expect to be free anyway when we were children our nurses used to give us tea out in the open air on little pine tables scrubbed as clean as milk pails sometimes as dick would pass us with his slow and consequential step we would call out do dick come and wait on us no little missies i never wait on pine tables wait till you get big enough to put your legs under your pa's mahogany i taught him to read as soon as i could read myself perched on his knife board he won't look at me now but looks over my head scenting freedom in the air he was always very ambitious i do not think he ever troubled himself much about books but then as my father said dick standing in front of his sideboard has heard all subjects in earth or heaven discussed and by the best heads in our world he is proud too in his way hetty his wife complained that the other men servants looked finer in their livery nonsense old woman a butler never demeans himself to wear livery he is always in plain clothes somewhere he had picked that up he is the first negro in whom i have felt a change others go about in their black masks not a ripple or an emotion showing and yet on all other subjects except the war they are the most excitable of all races now dick might make a very respectable egyptian sphinx so inscrutably silent is he he did deign to inquire about general richard anderson he was my young master once said he i always will like him better than anybody else when dick married hetty the anderson house was next door the two families agreed to sell either dick or hetty whichever consented to be sold hetty refused outright and the andersons sold dick that he might be with his wife this was magnanimous on the andersons part for hetty was only a lady's maid and dick was a trained butler on whom mrs anderson had spent no end of pains in his dining room education and of course if they had refused to sell dick hetty would have had to go to them mrs anderson was very much disgusted with dick's ingratitude when she found he was willing to leave them as a butler he is a treasure he is overwhelmed with dignity but that does not interfere with his work at all my father had a body servant simon who could imitate his master's voice perfectly he would sometimes call out from the yard after my father had mounted his horse dick bring me my overcoat i see you there sir hurry up when dick hastened out overcoat in hand and only simon was visible after several obsequious yes marster just as marster pleases my mother had always to step out and prevent a fight dick never forgave her laughing once in sumter when my father was very busy preparing a law case the mob in the street annoyed him and he grumbled about it as simon was making up his fire suddenly he heard as it were himself speaking the hon s d miller lawyer miller as the colored gentleman announced himself in the dark appeal to the gentlemen outside to go away and leave a lawyer in peace to prepare his case for the next day my father said he could have sworn the sound was that of his own voice the crowd dispersed but some noisy negroes came along and upon them simon rushed with the sulky whip slashing around in the dark calling himself lawyer miller who was determined to have peace simon returned complaining that them niggers run so he never got in a hundred yards of one of them at portland we met a man who said is it not strange that in this poor devoted land of ours there are some men who are making money by blockade running cheating our embarrassed government and skulking the fight montgomery july 30th coming on here from portland there was no stateroom for me my mother alone had one my aunt and i sat nodding in armchairs for the doors and sofas were covered with sleepers too on the floor that night so hot that even a little covering of clothes could not be borne lay a motley crew black white and yellow disported themselves in promiscuous array children and their nurses bared to the view were wrapped in the profoundest slumber no caste prejudices were here neither garrison john brown nor gerrit smith ever dreamed of equality more untrammeled a crow black enormously fat negro man waddled in every now and then to look after the lamps the atmosphere of that cabin was stifling and the sight of those figures on the floor did not make it more tolerable so we soon escaped and sat out near the guards the next day was the very hottest i have ever known one supreme consolation was the watermelons the very finest and the ice a very handsome woman whom i did not know rehearsed all our disasters in the field and then as if she held me responsible she faced me furiously and where are our big men whom do you mean i mean our leaders the men we have a right to look to to save us they got us into this scrape let them get us out of it where are our big men i sympathized with her and understood her but i answered lightly i do not know the exact size you want them here in montgomery we have been so hospitably received ye gods how those women talked and all at the same time they put me under the care of general dick taylor's brother in law a mr gordon who married one of the beranges a very pleasant arrangement it was for me he was kind and attentive and vastly agreeable with his new orleans anecdotes on the first of last january all his servants left him but four to these faithful few he gave free papers at once that they might lose naught by loyalty should the confederates come into authority once more he paid high wages and things worked smoothly for some weeks one day his wife saw some yankee officers cards on a table and said to her maid i did not know any of these people had called oh missis the maid replied they come to see me and i have been waiting to tell you it is too hard i can not do it i can not dance with those nice gentlemen at night at our union balls and then come here and be your servant the next day i can't so said mr gordon freedom must be followed by fraternity and equality one by one the faithful few slipped away and the family were left to their own devices why not when general dick taylor's place was sacked his negroes moved down to algiers a village near new orleans an old woman came to mr gordon to say that these negroes wanted him to get word to mars dick that they were dying of disease and starvation thirty had died that day dick taylor's help being out of the question mr gordon applied to a federal officer he found this one not a philanthropist but a cynic who said all right it is working out as i expected improve negroes and indians off the continent their strong men we put in the army the rest will disappear joe johnston can sulk as he is sent west he says they may give lee the army joe johnston trained lee is reaping where he sowed he thinks but then he was backing straight through richmond when they stopped his retreating
columbia s c july 6 1864 at the prestons mary was laughing at mrs lyons's complaint the person from whom we rented rooms in richmond she spoke of molly and lawrence's deceitfulness they went about the house quiet as mice while we were at home or lawrence sat at the door and sprang to his feet whenever we passed but when we were out they sang laughed shouted and danced if any of the lyons family passed him lawrence kept his seat with his hat on too mrs chesnut had said oh so meekly to the whole tirade and added i will see about it colonel urquhart and edmund rhett dined here charming men both no brag no detraction talk is never pleasant where there is either our noble georgian dined here he says hampton was the hero of the yankee rout at stony creek 1 he claims that citizens militia and lame soldiers kept the bridge at staunton and gallantly repulsed wilson's raiders at mrs s s last night she came up saying in new orleans four people never met together without dancing edmund rhett turned to me you shall be pressed into service no i belong to the reserve corps too old to volunteer or to be drafted as a conscript but i had to go my partner in the dance showed his english descent he took his pleasure sadly oh mr rhett at his pleasure can be a most agreeable companion said someone i never happened to meet him said i when he pleased to be otherwise with a hot draggled old alpaca dress and those clod hopping shoes to tumble slowly and gracefully through the mazes of a july dance was too much for me what depresses you so he anxiously inquired our carnival of death what a blunder to bring us all together here a reunion of consumptives to dance and sing until one can almost hear the death rattle july 25th now we are in a cottage rented from doctor chisolm hood is a full general johnston1 has been removed and superseded early is threatening washington city semmes of whom we have been so proud risked the alabama in a sort of duel of ships he has lowered the flag of the famous alabama to the kearsarge 2 forgive who may i can not we moved into this house on the 20th of july my husband was telegraphed to go to charleston general jones sent for him a part of his command is on the coast the girls were at my house everything was in the utmost confusion we were lying on a pile of mattresses in one of the front rooms while the servants were reducing things to order in the rear all the papers are down on the president for this change of commanders except the georgia papers indeed governor brown's constant complaints i dare say caused it these and the rage of the georgia people as johnston backed down on them isabella soon came she said she saw the preston sisters pass her house and as they turned the corner there was a loud and bitter cry it seemed to come from the hampton house both girls began to run at full speed what is the master asked mrs martin mother listen that sounded like the cry of a broken heart said isabella something has gone terribly wrong at the prestons mrs martin is deaf however so she heard nothing and thought isabella fanciful isabella hurried over there and learned that they had come to tell mrs preston that willie was killed willie his mother's darling no country ever had a braver soldier a truer gentleman to lay down his life in her cause july 26th isabella went with me to the bulletin board mrs d with the white linen as usual pasted on her chin asked me to read aloud what was there written as i slowly read on i heard a suppressed giggle from isabella i know her way of laughing at everything and tried to enunciate more distinctly to read more slowly and louder with more precision as i finished and turned round i found myself closely packed in by a crowd of confederate soldiers eager to hear the news they took off their caps thanked me for reading all that was on the boards and made way for me cap in hand as i hastily returned to the carriage which was waiting for us isabella proposed call out to them to give three cheers for jeff davis and his generals you forget my child that we are on our way to a funeral found my new house already open hospitably to all comers my husband had arrived he was seated at a pine table on which someone had put a coarse red table cover and by the light of one tallow candle was affably entertaining edward barnwell isaac hayne and uncle hamilton he had given them no tea however after i had remedied that oversight we adjourned to the moonlighted piazza by tallow candle light and the light of the moon we made out that wonderful smile of teddy's which identifies him as gerald grey we have laughed so at broken hearts the broken hearts of the foolish love stories but buck now is breaking her heart for her brother willie hearts do break in silence without a word or a sigh mrs means and mary barnwell made no moan simply turned their faces to the wall and died how many more that we know nothing of when i remember all the true hearted the light hearted the gay and gallant boys who have come laughing singing and dancing in my way in the three years now past how i have looked into their brave young eyes and helped then as i could in every way and then saw them no more forever how they lie stark and cold dead upon the battle field or moldering away in hospitals or prisons which is worse i think if i consider the long array of those bright youth and loyal men who have gone to their death almost before my very eyes my heart might break too is anything worth it this fearful sacrifice this awful penalty we pay for war allen g says johnston was a failure now he will wait and see what hood can do before he pronounces judgment on him he liked his address to his army it was grand and inspiring but every one knows a general has not time to write these things himself mr kelly from new orleans says dick taylor and kirby smith have quarreled one would think we had a big enough quarrel on hand for one while already the yankees are enough and to spare general lovell says joe brown with his georgians at his back who importuned our government to remove joe johnston they are scared now and wish they had not in our democratic republic if one rises to be its head whomever he displeases takes a turkish revenge and defiles the tombs of his father and mother hints that his father was a horse thief and his mother no better than she should be his sisters barmaids and worse his brothers yankee turncoats and traitors all this is hurled at lincoln or jeff davis indiscriminately
august 2d prince jerome1 has gone to washington now the yankees so far are as little trained as we are raw troops are they as yet suppose france takes the other side and we have to meet disciplined and armed men soldiers who understand war frenchmen with all the elan we boast of ransom calhoun willie preston and doctor nott's boys are here these foolish rash hare brained southern lads have been within an ace of a fight with a maryland company for their camping grounds it is much too irish to be so ready to fight anybody friend or foe men are thrilling with fiery ardor the red hot southern martial spirit is in the air these young men however were all educated abroad and it is french or german ideas that they are filled with the marylanders were as rash and reckless as the others and had their coat tails ready for anybody to tread on donnybrook fair fashion one would think there were yankees enough and to spare for any killing to be done it began about picketing their horses but these quarrelsome young soldiers have lovely manners they are so sweet tempered when seen here among us at the arlington august 5th a heavy heavy heart another missive from jordan querulous and fault finding things are all wrong beauregard's jordan had been crossed not the stream in canaan's fair and happy land where our possessions lie they seem to feel that the war is over here except the president and mr barnwell above all that foreboding friend of mine captain ingraham he thinks it hardly begun another outburst from jordan beauregard is not seconded properly hélas to think that any mortal general even though he had sprung up in a month or so from captain of artillery to general could be so puffed up with vanity so blinded by any false idea of his own consequence as to write to intimate that man or men would sacrifice their country injure themselves ruin their families to spite the aforesaid general conceit and self assertion can never reach a higher point than that and yet they give you to understand mr davis does not like beauregard in point of fact they fancy he is jealous of him and rather than beauregard shall have a showing the president who would be hanged at least if things go wrong will cripple the army to spite beauregard mr mallory says how we could laugh but you see it is no laughing matter to have our fate in the hands of such self sufficient vain army idiots so the amenities of life are spreading in the meantime we seem to be resting on our oars debating in congress while the enterprising yankees are quadrupling their army at their leisure every day some of our regiments march away from here the town is crowded with soldiers these new ones are fairly running in fearing the war will be over before they get a sight of the fun every man from every little precinct wants a place in the picture tuesday the north requires 600,000 men to invade us truly we are a formidable power the herald says it is useless to move with a man less than that england has made it all up with them or rather she will not break with them jerome napoleon is in washington and not our friend doctor gibbes is a bird of ill omen to day he tells me eight of our men have died at the charlottesville hospital it seems sickness is more redoubtable in an army than the enemy's guns there are 1,100 there hors de combat and typhoid fever is with them they want money clothes and nurses so as i am writing right and left the letters fly calling for help from the sister societies at home good and patriotic women at home are easily stirred to their work mary hammy has many strings to her bow a fiancé in the army and doctor berrien in town to day she drove out with major smith and colonel hood yesterday custis lee was here she is a prudent little puss and needs no good advice if i were one to give it lawrence does all our shopping all his master's money has been in his hands until now i thought it injudicious when gold is at such a premium to leave it lying loose in the tray of a trunk so i have sewed it up in a belt which i can wear upon an emergency the cloth is wadded and my diamonds are there too it has strong strings and can be tied under my hoops about my waist if the worst comes to the worst as the saying is lawrence wears the same bronze mask no sign of anything he may feel or think of my latest fancy only i know he asks for twice as much money now when he goes to buy things august 8th to day i saw a sword captured at manassas the man who brought the sword in the early part of the fray was taken prisoner by the yankees they stripped him possessed themselves of his sleeve buttons and were in the act of depriving him of his boots when the rout began and the play was reversed proceedings then took the opposite tack from a small rill in the mountain has flowed the mighty stream which has made at last louis wigfall the worst enemy the president has in the congress a fact which complicates our affairs no little mr davis's hands ought to be strengthened he ought to be upheld a divided house must fall we all say mrs sam jones who is called becky by her friends and cronies male and female said that mrs pickens had confided to the aforesaid jones née taylor and so of the president taylor family and cousin of mr davis's first wife that mrs wigfall described mrs davis to mrs pickens as a coarse western woman now the fair lucy holcombe and mrs wigfall had a quarrel of their own out in texas and though reconciled there was bitterness underneath at first mrs joe johnston called mrs davis a western belle 1 but when the quarrel between general johnston and the president broke out mrs johnston took back the belle and substituted woman in the narrative derived from mrs jones commodore barron1 came with glad tidings we had taken three prizes at sea and brought them in safely one laden with molasses general toombs told us the president complimented mr chesnut when he described the battle scene to his cabinet etc general toombs is certain colonel chesnut will be made one of the new batch of brigadiers next came mr clayton who calmly informed us jeff davis would not get the vote of this congress for president so we might count him out mr meynardie first told us how pious a christian soldier was kershaw how he prayed got up dusted his knees and led his men on to victory with a dash and courage equal to any old testament mighty man of war governor manning's account of prince jerome napoleon he is stout and he is not handsome neither is he young and as he reviewed our troops he was terribly overheated he heard him say en avant of that he could testify of his own knowledge and he was told he had been heard to say with unction allons more than once the sight of the battle field had made the prince seasick and he received gratefully a draft of fiery whisky arrago seemed deeply interested in confederate statistics and praised our doughty deeds to the skies it was but soldier fare our guests received though we did our best it was hard sleeping and worse eating in camp beauregard is half frenchman and speaks french like a native so one awkward mess was done away with and it was a comfort to see beauregard speak without the agony of finding words in the foreign language and forming them with damp brow into sentences a different fate befell others who spoke a little french general and mrs cooper came to see us she is mrs smith lee's sister they were talking of old george mason in virginia a name to conjure with george mason violently opposed the extension of slavery he was a thorough aristocrat and gave as his reason for refusing the blessing of slaves to the new states southwest and northwest that vulgar new people were unworthy of so sacred a right as that of holding slaves it was not an institution intended for such people as they were mrs lee said after all what good does it do my sons that they are light horse harry lee's grandsons and george mason's i do not see that it helps them at all a friend in washington writes me that we might have walked into washington any day for a week after manassas such were the consternation and confusion there but the god pan was still blowing his horn in the woods now she says northern troops are literally pouring in from all quarters the horses cover acres of ground and she thinks we have lost our chance forever a man named grey the same gentleman whom secretary of war walker so astonished by greeting him with well sir and what is your business described the battle of the 21st as one succession of blunders redeemed by the indomitable courage of the two thirds who did not run away on our side doctor mason said a fugitive on the other side informed him that a million of men with the devil at their back could not have whipped the rebels at bull run that's nice there must be opposition in a free country but it is very uncomfortable united we stand divided we fall mrs davis showed us in the new york tribune an extract from an augusta georgia paper saying cobb is our man davis is at heart a reconstructionist we may be flies on the wheel we know our insignificance but mrs preston and myself have entered into an agreement our oath is recorded on high we mean to stand by our president and to stop all fault finding with the powers that be if we can and where we can be the fault finders generals or cabinet ministers august 13th hon robert barnwell says the mercury's influence began this opposition to jeff davis before he had time to do wrong they were offended not with him so much as with the man who was put into what they considered barnwell rhett's rightful place the latter had howled nullification and secession so long that when he found his ideas taken up by all the confederate world he felt he had a vested right to leadership jordan beauregard's aide still writes to mr chesnut that the mortality among the raw troops in that camp is fearful everybody seems to be doing all they can think of the british sick and wounded away off in the crimea our people are only a half day's journey by rail from richmond with a grateful heart i record the fact of reconciliation with the wigfalls they dined at the president's yesterday and the little wigfall girls stayed all night seward is fêting the outsiders the cousin of the emperor napoleon iii and russell of the omnipotent london times august 14th last night there was a crowd of men to see us and they were so markedly critical i made a futile effort to record their sayings but sleep and heat overcame me to day i can not remember a word one of mr mason's stories relates to our sources of trustworthy information a man of very respectable appearance standing on the platform at the depot announced i am just from the seat of war out came pencil and paper from the newspaper men on the qui vive is fairfax court house burned they asked yes burned yesterday but i am just from there said another left it standing there all right an hour or so ago oh but i must do them justice to say they burned only the tavern for they did not want to tear up and burn anything else after the railroad there is no railroad at fairfax court house objected the man just from fairfax oh indeed said the seat of war man i did not know that is that so and he coolly seated himself and began talking of something else our people are lashing themselves into a fury against the prisoners only the mob in any country would do that but i am told to be quiet decency and propriety will not be forgotten and the prisoners will be treated as prisoners of war ought to be in a civilized country august 15th mrs randolph came with her were the freelands rose and maria the men rave over mrs randolph's beauty called her a magnificent specimen of the finest type of dark eyed rich and glowing southern woman kind clear brunette she is with the reddest lips the whitest teeth and glorious eyes there is no other word for them having given mrs randolph the prize among southern beauties mr clayton said prentiss was the finest southern orator mr marshall and mr barnwell dissented they preferred william c preston mr chesnut had found colquitt the best or most effective stump orator saw henry deas nott he is just from paris via new york says new york is ablaze with martial fire at no time during the crimean war was there ever in paris the show of soldiers preparing for the war such as he saw at new york the face of the earth seemed covered with marching regiments not more than 500 effective men are in hampton's legion but they kept the whole yankee army at bay until half past two then just as hampton was wounded and half his colonels shot cash and kershaw from mrs smith lee audibly how about kirby smith dashed in and not only turned the tide but would have driven the fugitives into washington but beauregard recalled them mr chesnut finds all this very amusing as he posted many of the regiments and all the time was carrying orders over the filed the discrepancies in all these private memories amuse him but he smiles pleasantly and lets every man tell the tale in his own way august 16th mr barnwell says fame is an article usually home made you must create your own puffs or superintend their manufacture and you must see that the newspapers print your own military reports no one else will give you half the credit you take to yourself no one will look after your fine name before the world with the loving interest and faith you have yourself august 17th captain shannon of the kirkwood rangers called and stayed three hours has not been under fire yet but is keen to see or to hear the flashing of the guns proud of himself proud of his company but proudest of all that he has no end of the bluest blood of the low country in his troop he seemed to find my knitting a pair of socks a day for the soldiers droll in some way the yarn is coarse he has been so short a time from home he does not know how the poor soldiers need them he was so overpoweringly flattering to my husband that i found him very pleasant company august 18th found it quite exciting to have a spy drinking his tea with us perhaps because i knew his profession i did not like his face he is said to have a scheme by which washington will fall into our hands like an overripe peach mr barnwell urges mr chesnut to remain in the senate there are so many generals or men anxious to be he says mr chesnut can do his country most good by wise counsels where they are most needed i do not say to the contrary i dare not throw my influence on the army side for if anything happened mr miles told us last night that he had another letter from general beauregard the general wants to know if mr miles has delivered his message to colonel kershaw mr miles says he has not done so neither does he mean to do it they must settle these matters of veracity according to their own military etiquette he is a civilian once more it is a foolish wrangle colonel kershaw ought to have reported to his commander in chief and not made an independent report and published it he meant no harm he is not yet used to the fine ways of war the new york tribune is so unfair it began by howling to get rid of us we were so wicked now that we are so willing to leave them to their overrighteous self consciousness they cry crush our enemy or they will subjugate us the idea that we want to invade or subjugate anybody we would be only too grateful to be left alone we ask no more of gods or men went to the hospital with a carriage load of peaches and grapes made glad the hearts of some men thereby when my supplies gave out those who had none looked so wistfully as i passed out that i made a second raid on the market those eyes sunk in cavernous depths and following me from bed to bed haunt me wilmot de saussure harrowed my soul by an account of a recent death by drowning on the beach at sullivan's island mr porcher who was trying to save his sister's life lost his own and his child's people seem to die out of the army quite as much as in it mrs randolph presided in all her beautiful majesty at an aid association the ladies were old and all wanted their own way they were cross grained and contradictory and the blood mounted rebelliously into mrs randolph's clear cut cheeks but she held her own with dignity and grace one of the causes of disturbance was that mrs randolph proposed to divide everything sent on equally with the yankee wounded and sick prisoners some were enthusiastic from a christian point of view some shrieked in wrath at the bare idea of putting our noble soldiers on a par with yankees living dying or dead fierce dames were some of them august severe matrons who evidently had not been accustomed to hear the other side of any question from anybody and just old enough to find the last pleasure in life to reside in power the power to make their claws felt august 23d a brother of doctor garnett has come fresh and straight from cambridge mass and says or is said to have said with all the difference there is between the two that recruiting up there is dead he came by cincinnati and pittsburg and says all the way through it was so sad mournful and quiet it looked like sunday i asked mr brewster if it were true senator toombs had turned brigadier yes soldiering is in the air every one will have a touch of it toombs could not stay in the cabinet why incompatibility of temper he rides too high a horse that is for so despotic a person as jeff davis i have tried to find out the sore but i can't mr toombs has been out with them all for months dissension will break out everything does but it takes a little time there is a perfect magazine of discord and discontent in that cabinet only wants a hand to apply the torch and up they go toombs says old memminger has his back up as high as any oh such a day since i wrote this morning i have been with mrs randolph to all the hospitals i can never again shut out of view the sights i saw there of human misery i sit thinking shut my eyes and see it all thinking yes and there is enough to think about now god knows gilland's was the worst with long rows of ill men on cots ill of typhoid fever of every human ailment on dinner tables for eating and drinking wounds being dressed all the horrors to be taken in at one glance then we went to the st charles horrors upon horrors again want of organization long rows of dead and dying awful sights a boy from home had sent for me he was dying in a cot ill of fever next him a man died in convulsions as we stood there i was making arrangements with a nurse hiring him to take care of this lad but i do not remember any more for i fainted next that i knew of the doctor and mrs randolph were having me a limp rag put into a carriage at the door of the hospital fresh air i dare say brought me to as we drove home the doctor came along with us i was so upset he said look at that georgia regiment marching there look at their servants on the sidewalk i have been counting them making an estimate there is 16,000 sixteen thousand dollars worth of negro property which can go off on its own legs to the yankees whenever it pleases august 24th daniel of the examiner was at the president's wilmot de saussure wondered if a fellow did not feel a little queer paying his respects in person at the house of a man whom he abused daily in his newspaper a fiasco an aide engaged to two young ladies in the same house the ladies had been quarreling but became friends unexpectedly when his treachery among many other secrets was revealed under that august roof fancy the row when it all came out mr lowndes said we have already reaped one good result from the war the orators the spouters the furious patriots that could hardly be held down and who were so wordily anxious to do or die for their country they had been the pest of our lives now they either have not tried the battle field at all or have precipitately left it at their earliest convenience for very shame we are rid of them for a while i doubt it bright's speech1 is dead against us reading this does not brighten one august 25th mr barnwell says democracies lead to untruthfulness to be always electioneering is to be always false so both we and the yankees are unreliable as regards our own exploits how about empires were there ever more stupendous lies than the emperor napoleon's mr barnwell went on people dare not tell the truth in a canvass they must conciliate their constituents now everybody in a democracy always wants an office at least everybody in richmond just now seems to want one never heeding interruptions he went on as a nation the english are the most truthful in the world and so are our country gentlemen they own their constituents at least in some of the parishes where there are few whites only immense estates peopled by negroes thackeray speaks of the lies that were told on both sides in the british wars with france england kept quite alongside of her rival in that fine art england lied then as fluently as russell lies about us now went to see agnes de leon my columbia school friend she is fresh from egypt and i wished to hear of the nile the crocodiles the mummies the sphinx and the pyramids but her head ran upon washington life such as we knew it and her soul was here no theme was possible but a discussion of the latest war news mr clayton assistant secretary of state says we spend two millions a week where is all that money to come from they don't want us to plant cotton but to make provisions now cotton always means money or did when there was an outlet for it and anybody to buy it where is money to come from now mr barnwell's new joke i dare say is a joe miller but mr barnwell laughed in telling it till he cried a man was fined for contempt of court and then his case coming on the judge talked such arrant nonsense and was so warped in his mind against the poor man that the fined one walked up and handed the august judge a five dollar bill why what is that for said the judge oh i feel such a contempt of this court coming on again i came up tired to death took down my hair had it hanging over me in a crazy jane fashion and sat still hands over my head half undressed but too lazy and sleepy to move i was sitting in a rocking chair by an open window taking my ease and the cool night air when suddenly the door opened and captain walked in he was in the middle of the room before he saw his mistake he stared and was transfixed as the novels say i dare say i looked an ancient gorgon then with a more frantic glare he turned and fled without a word i got up and bolted the door after him and then looked in the glass and laughed myself into hysterics i shall never forget to lock the door again but it does not matter in this case i looked totally unlike the person bearing my name who covered with lace cap etc frequents the drawing room i doubt if he would know me again august 26th the terror has full swing at the north now all the papers favorable to us have been suppressed how long would our mob stand a yankee paper here but newspapers against our government such as the examiner and the mercury flourish like green bay trees a man up to the elbows in finance said to day clayton's story is all nonsense they do sometimes pay out two millions a week they paid the soldiers this week but they don't pay the soldiers every week not by a long shot cried a soldier laddie with a grin why do you write in your diary at all some one said to me if as you say you have to contradict every day what you wrote yesterday because i tell the tale as it is told to me i write current rumor i do not vouch for anything we went to pizzini's that very best of italian confectioners from there we went to miss sally tompkins's hospital loaded with good things for the wounded the men under miss sally's kind care looked so clean and comfortable cheerful one might say they were pleasant and nice to see one however was dismal in tone and aspect and he repeated at intervals with no change of words in a forlorn monotone what a hard time we have had since we left home but nobody seemed to heed his wailing and it did not impair his appetite at mrs toombs's who was raging so anti davis she will not even admit that the president is ill all humbug but what good could pretending to be ill do him that reception now was not that a humbug such a failure mrs reagan could have done better than that mrs walker is a montgomery beauty with such magnificent dresses she was an heiress and is so dissatisfied with richmond accustomed as she is to being a belle under different conditions as she is as handsome and well dressed as ever it must be the men who are all wrong did you give lawrence that fifty dollar bill to go out and change it i was asked suppose he takes himself off to the yankees he would leave us with not too many fifty dollar bills he is not going anywhere however i think his situation suits him that wadded belt of mine with the gold pieces quilted in has made me ashamed more than once i leave it under my pillow and my maid finds it there and hangs it over the back of a chair in evidence as i reenter the room after breakfast when i forget and leave my trunk open lawrence brings me the keys and tells me you oughten to do so miss mary mr chesnut leaves all his little money in his pockets and lawrence says that's why he can't let any one but himself brush mars jeems's clothes august 27th theodore barker and james lowndes came the latter has been wretchedly treated a man said all that i wish on earth is to be at peace and on my own plantation to which mr lowndes replied quietly i wish i had a plantation to be on but just now i can't see how any one would feel justified in leaving the army mr barker was bitter against the spirit of braggadocio so rampant among us the gentleman who had been answered so completely by james lowndes said with spitefulness those women who are so frantic for their husbands to join the army would like them killed no doubt things were growing rather uncomfortable but an interruption came in the shape of a card an old classmate of mr chesnut's captain archer just now fresh from california followed his card so quickly that mr chesnut had hardly time to tell us that in princeton college they called him sally archer he was so pretty when he entered he is good looking still but the service and consequent rough life have destroyed all softness and girlishness he will never be so pretty again the north is consolidated they move as one man with no states but an army organized by the central power russell in the northern camp is cursed of yankees for that bull run letter russell in his capacity of englishman despises both sides he divides us equally into north and south he prefers to attribute our victory at bull run to yankee cowardice rather than to southern courage he gives no credit to either side for good qualities we are after all mere americans everything not national is arrested it looks like the business of seward i do not know when i have seen a woman without knitting in her hand socks for the soldiers is the cry one poor man said he had dozens of socks and but one shirt he preferred more shirts and fewer stockings we make a quaint appearance with this twinkling of needles and the everlasting sock dangling below they have arrested wm b reed and miss winder she boldly proclaiming herself a secessionist why should she seek a martyr's crown writing people love notoriety it is so delightful to be of enough consequence to be arrested i have often wondered if such incense was ever offered as napoleon's so called persecution and alleged jealousy of madame de staël russell once more to whom london paris and india have been an every day sight and every night too streets and all how absurd for him to go on in indignation because there have been women on negro plantations who were not vestal virgins negro women get married and after marriage behave as well as other people marrying is the amusement of their lives they take life easily so do their class everywhere bad men are hated here as elsewhere i hate slavery i hate a man who you say there are no more fallen women on a plantation than in london in proportion to numbers but what do you say to this to a magnate who runs a hideous black harem with its consequences under the same roof with his lovely white wife and his beautiful and accomplished daughters he holds his head high and poses as the model of all human virtues to these poor women whom god and the laws have given him from the height of his awful majesty he scolds and thunders at them as if he never did wrong in his life fancy such a man finding his daughter reading don juan you with that immoral book he would say and then he would order her out of his sight you see mrs stowe did not hit the sorest spot she makes legree a bachelor remember george ii and his likes oh i know half a legree a man said to be as cruel as legree but the other half of him did not correspond he was a man of polished manners and the best husband and father and member of the church in the world can that be so yes i know it exceptional case that sort of thing always and i knew the dissolute half of legree well he was high and mighty but the kindest creature to his slaves and the unfortunate results of his bad ways were not sold had not to jump over ice blocks they were kept in full view and provided for handsomely in his will the wife and daughters in the might of their purity and innocence are supposed never to dream of what is as plain before their eyes as the sunlight and they play their parts of unsuspecting angels to the letter they profess to adore the father as the model of all saintly goodness well yes if he is rich he is the fountain from whence all blessings flow the one i have in my eye my half of legree the dissolute half was so furious in temper and thundered his wrath so at the poor women they were glad to let him do as he pleased in peace if they could only escape his everlasting fault finding and noisy bluster making everybody so uncomfortable now now do you know any woman of this generation who would stand that sort of thing no never not for one moment the make believe angels were of the last century we know and we won't have it the condition of women is improving it seems women are brought up not to judge their fathers or their husbands they take them as the lord provides and are thankful if they should not go to heaven after all think what lives most women lead no heaven no purgatory no the other thing never i believe in future rewards and punishments how about the wives of drunkards i heard a woman say once to a friend of her husband tell it as a cruel matter of fact without bitterness without comment oh you have not seen him he has changed he has not gone to bed sober in thirty years she has had her purgatory if not the other thing here in this world we all know what a drunken man is to think for no crime a person may be condemned to live with one thirty years you wander from the question i asked are southern men worse because of the slave system and the facile black women not a bit they see too much of them the barroom people don't drink the confectionery people loathe candy they are sick of the black sight of them you think a nice man from the south is the nicest thing in the world i know it put him by any other man and see have seen yankee letters taken at manassas the spelling is often atrocious and we thought they had all gone through a course of blue covered noah webster spelling books our soldiers do spell astonishingly there is horace greeley they say he can't read his own handwriting but he is candid enough and disregards all time serving he says in his paper that in our army the north has a hard nut to crack and that the rank and file of our army is superior in education and general intelligence to theirs my wildest imagination will not picture mr mason1 as a diplomat he will say chaw for chew and he will call himself jeems and he will wear a dress coat to breakfast over here whatever a mason does is right in his own eyes he is above law somebody asked him how he pronounced his wife's maiden name she was a miss chew from philadelphia they say the english will like mr mason he is so manly so straightforward so truthful and bold a fine old english gentleman so said russell to me but for tobacco i like mr mason and mr hunter better than anybody else and yet they are wonderfully unlike now you just listen to me said i is mrs davis in hearing no well this sending mr mason to london is the maddest thing yet worse in some points of view than yancey and that was a catastrophe august 29th no more feminine gossip but the licensed slanderer the mighty russell of the times he says the battle of the 21st was fought at long range 500 yards apart were the combatants the confederates were steadily retreating when some commotion in the wagon train frightened the yanks and they made tracks in good english they fled amain and on our side we were too frightened to follow them in high flown english to pursue the flying foe in spite of all this there are glimpses of the truth sometimes and the story leads to our credit with all the sneers and jeers when he speaks of the yankees cowardice falsehood dishonesty and braggadocio the best words are in his mouth he repeats the thrice told tale so often refuted and denied that we were harsh to wounded prisoners dr gibson told me that their surgeon general has written to thank our surgeons yankee officers write very differently from russell i know that in that hospital with the sisters of charity they were better off than our men were at the other hospitals that i saw with my own eyes these poor souls are jealously guarded night and day it is a hideous tale what they tell of their sufferings women who come before the public are in a bad box now false hair is taken off and searched for papers bustles are suspect all manner of things they say come over the border under the huge hoops now worn so they are ruthlessly torn off not legs but arms are looked for under hoops and sad to say found then women are used as detectives and searchers to see that no men slip over in petticoats so the poor creatures coming this way are humiliated to the deepest degree to men glory honor praise and power if they are patriots to women daughters of eve punishment comes still in some shape do what they will mary hammy's eyes were starting from her head with amazement while a very large and handsome south carolinian talked rapidly what is it asked i after he had gone oh what a year can bring forth one year last summer you remember how he swore he was in love with me he told you he told me he told everybody and if i did refuse to marry him i believed him now he says he has seen fallen in love with courted and married another person and he raves of his little daughter's beauty and they say time goes slowly thus spoke mary hammy with a sigh of wonder at his wonderful cure time works wonders said the explainer general what conclusion did you come to as to southern men at the grand pow wow you know they are nicer than the nicest the gentlemen you know there are not too many of that kind anywhere ours are generous truthful brave and and devoted to us you know a southern husband is not a bad thing to have about the house mrs frank hampton said for one thing you could not flirt with these south carolinians they would not stay at the tepid degree of flirtation they grow so horridly in earnest before you know where you are do you think two married people ever lived together without finding each other out i mean knowing exactly how good or how shabby how weak or how strong above all how selfish each was yes unless they are dolts they know to a tittle but you see if they have common sense they make believe and get on so so like the marchioness's orange peel wine in old curiosity shop a violent attack upon the north to day in the albion they mean to let freedom slide a while until they subjugate us the albion says they use lettres de cachet passports and all the despotic apparatus of regal governments russell hears the tramp of the coming man the king and kaiser tyrant that is to rule them is it mcclellan little mac we may tremble when he comes we down here have only the many headed monster thing armed democracy our chiefs quarrel among themselves mcclellan is of a forgiving spirit he does not resent russell's slurs upon yankees but with good policy has russell with him as a guest the adonis of an aide avers as one who knows that sumter anderson's heart is with us that he will not fight the south after all is said and done that sounds like nonsense sumter anderson's wife was a daughter of governor clinch of georgia does that explain it he also told me something of garnett who was killed at rich mountain 1 he had been an unlucky man clear through in the army before the war the aide had found him proud reserved and morose cold as an icicle to all but for his wife and child he was a different creature he adored them and cared for nothing else one day he went off on an expedition and was gone six weeks he was out in the northwest and the indians were troublesome when he came back his wife and child were underground he said not one word but they found him more frozen stern and isolated than ever that was all the night before he left richmond he said in his quiet way they have not given me an adequate force i can do nothing they have sent me to my death it is acknowledged that he threw away his life a dreary hearted man said the aide and the unluckiest on the front steps every evening we take our seats and discourse at our pleasure a nicer or more agreeable set of people were never assembled than our present arlington crowd to night it was yancey1 who occupied our tongues send a man to england who had killed his father in law in a street brawl that was not knowing england or englishmen surely who wants eloquence we want somebody who can hold his tongue people avoid great talkers men who orate men given to monologue as they would avoid fire famine or pestilence yancey will have no mobs to harangue no stump speeches will be possible superb as are his of their kind but little quiet conversation is best with slow solid common sense people who begin to suspect as soon as any flourish of trumpets meets their ear if yancey should use his fine words who would care for them over there commodore barron when he was a middy accompanied phil augustus stockton to claim his bride he the said stockton had secretly wedded a fair heiress sally cantey she was married by a magistrate and returned to mrs grillaud's boarding school until it was time to go home that is to camden lieutenant stockton a descendant of the signer was the handsomest man in the navy and irresistible the bride was barely sixteen when he was to go down south among those fire eaters and claim her commodore barron then his intimate friend went as his backer they were to announce the marriage and defy the guardians commodore barron said he anticipated a rough job of it all but they were prepared for all risks you expected to find us a horde of savages no doubt said i we did not expect to get off under a half dozen duels they looked for insults from every quarter and they found a polished and refined people who lived en prince to say the least of it they were received with a cold stately and faultless politeness which made them feel as if they had been sheep stealing the young lady had confessed to her guardians and they were for making the best of it above all for saving her name from all gossip or publicity colonel john boykin one of them took young lochinvar to stay with him his friend barron was also a guest colonel deas sent for a parson and made assurance doubly sure by marrying them over again their wish was to keep things quiet and not to make a nine days wonder of the young lady then came balls parties and festivities without end he was enchanted with the easy going life of these people with dinners the finest in the world deer hunting and fox hunting dancing and pretty girls in fact everything that heart could wish but then said commodore barron the better it was and the kinder the treatment the more ashamed i grew of my business down there after all it was stealing an heiress you know i told him how the same fate still haunted that estate in camden mr stockton sold it to a gentleman who later sold it to an old man who had married when near eighty and who left it to the daughter born of that marriage this pretty child of his old age was left an orphan quite young at the age of fifteen she ran away and married a boy of seventeen a canny scotchman the young couple lived to grow up and it proved after all a happy marriage this last heiress left six children so the estate will now be divided and no longer tempt the fortune hunters the commodore said to think how we two youngsters in our blue uniforms went down there to bully those people he was much at colonel chesnut's mrs chesnut being a philadelphian he was somewhat at ease with them it was the most thoroughly appointed establishment he had then ever visited went with our leviathan of loveliness to a ladies meeting no scandal to day no wrangling all harmonious everybody knitting dare say that soothing occupation helped our perturbed spirits to be calm mrs c is lovely a perfect beauty said brewster in circassia think what a price would be set upon her for there beauty sells by the pound coming home the following conversation so mrs blank thinks purgatory will hold its own never be abolished while women and children have to live with drunken fathers and brothers she knows she is too bitter she says worse than that she says we have an institution worse than the spanish inquisition worse than torquemada and all that sort of thing what does she mean you ask her her words are sharp arrows i am a dull creature and i should spoil all by repeating what she says it is your own family that she calls the familiars of the inquisition she declares that they set upon you fall foul of you watch and harass you from morn till dewy eve they have a perfect right to your life night and day unto the fourth and fifth generation they drop in at breakfast and say are you not imprudent to eat that take care now don't overdo it i think you eat too much so early in the day and they help themselves to the only thing you care for on the table they abuse your friends and tell you it is your duty to praise your enemies they tell you of all your faults candidly because they love you so that gives them a right to speak what family interest they take in you you ought to do this you ought to do that and then the everlasting you ought to have done which comes near making you a murderer at least in heart blood's thicker than water they say and there is where the longing to spill it comes in no locks or bolts or bars can keep them out are they not your nearest family they dine with you dropping in after you are at soup they come after you have gone to bed when all the servants have gone away and the man of the house in his nightshirt standing sternly at the door with the huge wooden bar in his hand nearly scares them to death and you are glad of it private life indeed she says her husband entered public life and they went off to live in a far away city then for the first time in her life she knew privacy she never will forget how she jumped for joy as she told her servant not to admit a soul until after two o'clock in the day afterward she took a fixed day at home then she was free indeed she could read and write stay at home go out at her own sweet will no longer sitting for hours with her fingers between the leaves of a frantically interesting book while her kin slowly driveled nonsense by the yard waiting waiting yawning would they never go then for hurting you who is like a relative they do it from a sense of duty for stinging you for cutting you to the quick who like one of your own household in point of fact they alone can do it they know the sore and how to hit it every time you are in their power she says did you ever see a really respectable responsible revered and beloved head of a family who ever opened his mouth at home except to find fault he really thinks that is his business in life and that all enjoyment is sinful he is there to prevent the women from such frivolous things as pleasure etc etc i sat placidly rocking in my chair by the window trying to hope all was for the best mary hammy rushed in literally drowned in tears i never saw so drenched a face in my life my heart stopped still commodore barron is taken prisoner said she the yankees have captured him and all his lieutenants poor imogen and there is my father scouting about the lord knows where i only know he is in the advance guard the barron's time has come mine may come any minute oh cousin mary when mrs lee told imogen she fainted those poor girls they are nearly dead with trouble and fright go straight back to those children i said nobody will touch a hair of their father's head tell them i say so they dare not they are not savages quite this is a civilized war you know mrs lee said to mrs eustis mr corcoran's daughter yesterday have you seen those accounts of arrests in washington mrs eustis answered calmly yes i know all about it i suppose you allude to the fact that my father has been imprisoned no no interrupted the explainer she means the incarceration of those mature washington belles suspected as spies but mrs eustis continued i have no fears for my father's safety august 31st congress adjourns to day jeff davis ill we go home on monday if i am able to travel already i feel the dread stillness and torpor of our sahara of a sand hill creeping into my veins it chills the marrow of my bones i am reveling in the noise of city life i know what is before me nothing more cheering than the cry of the lone whippoorwill will break the silence at sandy hill except as night draws near when the screech owl will add his mournful note
august 1,1862 being ill i left mrs mcmahan's for flat rock 1 it was very hot and disagreeable for an invalid in a boarding house in that climate the la bordes and the mccord girls came part of the way with me the cars were crowded and a lame soldier had to stand leaning on his crutches in the thoroughfare that runs between the seats one of us gave him our seat you may depend upon it there was no trouble in finding a seat for our party after that dr la borde quoted a classic anecdote in some greek assembly an old man was left standing a spartan gave him his seat the athenians cheered madly though they had kept their seats the comment was lacedemonians practice virtue athenians know how to admire it nathan davis happened accidentally to be at the station at greenville he took immediate charge of molly and myself for my party had dwindled to us two he went with us to the hotel sent for the landlord told him who i was secured good rooms for us and saw that we were made comfortable in every way at dinner i entered that immense dining room alone but i saw friends and acquaintances on every side my first exploit was to repeat to mrs ives mrs pickens's blunder in taking a suspicious attitude toward men born at the north and calling upon general cooper to agree with her martha levy explained the grave faces of my auditors by saying that colonel ives was a new yorker my distress was dire louisa hamilton was there she told me that captain george cuthbert with his arm in a sling from a wound by no means healed was going to risk the shaking of a stagecoach he was on his way to his cousin william cuthbert's at flat rock now george cuthbert is a type of the finest kind of southern soldier we can not make them any better than he is before the war i knew him he traveled in europe with my sister kate and mary withers at once i offered him a seat in the comfortable hack nathan davis had engaged for me molly sat opposite to me and often when i was tired held my feet in her lap captain cuthbert's man sat with the driver we had ample room we were a dilapidated company i was so ill i could barely sit up and captain cuthbert could not use his right hand or arm at all i had to draw his match light his cigar etc he was very quiet grateful gentle and i was going to say docile he is a fiery soldier one of those whose whole face becomes transfigured in battle so one of his men told me describing his way with his company he does not blow his own trumpet but i made him tell me the story of his duel with the mercury's reporter he seemed awfully ashamed of wasting time in such a scrape that night we stopped at a country house half way toward our journey's end there we met mr charles lowndes rawlins lowndes his son is with wade hampton first we drove by mistake into judge king's yard our hackman mistaking the place for the hotel then we made farmer's hotel as the seafaring men say burnet rhett with his steed was at the door horse and man were caparisoned with as much red and gold artillery uniform as they could bear he held his horse the stirrups were mexican i believe they looked like little sidesaddles seeing his friend and crony george cuthbert alight and leave a veiled lady in the carriage this handsome and undismayed young artillerist walked round and round the carriage talked with the driver looked in at the doors and at the front suddenly i bethought me to raise my veil and satisfy his curiosity our eyes met and i smiled it was impossible to resist the comic disappointment on his face when a woman old enough to be george cuthbert's mother with the ravages of a year of gastric fever almost fainting with fatigue greeted his vision he instantly mounted his gallant steed and pranced away to his fiancée he is to marry the greatest heiress in the state miss aiken then captain cuthbert told me his name at kate's i found sally rutledge and then for weeks life was a blank i remember nothing the illness which had been creeping on for so long a time took me by the throat at greenville i had met many friends i witnessed the wooing of barny heyward once the husband of the lovely lucy izard now a widower and a bon parti he was there nursing joe his brother so was the beautiful henrietta magruder heyward now a widow for poor joe died there is something magnetic in tatty clinch's large and lustrous black eyes no man has ever resisted their influence she says her virgin heart has never beat one throb the faster for any mortal here below until now when it surrenders to barny well as i said joseph heyward died and rapidly did the bereaved beauty shake the dust of this poor confederacy from her feet and plume her wings for flight across the water let me insert here now much later all i know of that brave spirit george cuthbert while i was living in the winter of 1863 at the corner of clay and twelfth streets in richmond he came to see me never did man enjoy life more the preston girls were staying at my house then and it was very gay for the young soldiers who ran down from the army for a day or so we had heard of him as usual gallantly facing odds at sharpsburg 1 and he asked if he should chance to be wounded would i have him brought to clay street he was shot at chancellorsville 2 leading his men the surgeon did not think him mortally wounded he sent me a message that he was coming at once to our house he knew he would soon get well there also that i need not be alarmed those yankees could not kill me he asked one of his friends to write a letter to his mother afterward he said he had another letter to write but that he wished to sleep first he felt so exhausted at his request they then turned his face away from the light and left him when they came again to look at him they found him dead he had been dead for a long time it was bitter cold wounded men lost much blood and were weakened in that way they lacked warm blankets and all comforts many died who might have been saved by one good hot drink or a few mouthfuls of nourishing food one of the generals said to me fire and reckless courage like captain cuthbert's are contagious such men in an army are invaluable losses like this weakened us indeed but i must not linger longer around the memory of the bravest of the brave a true exemplar of our old régime gallant gay unfortunate m b c august 8th mr daniel blake drove down to my sister's in his heavy substantial english phaeton with stout and strong horses to match i went back with him and spent two delightful days at his hospitable mansion i met there as a sort of chaplain the rev mr he dealt unfairly by me we had a long argument and when we knelt down for evening prayers he introduced an extemporaneous prayer and prayed for me most palpably there was i down on my knees red hot with rage and fury david w said it was a clear case of hitting a fellow when he was down afterward the fun of it all struck me and i found it difficult to keep from shaking with laughter it was not an edifying religious exercise to say the least as far as i was concerned before chancellorsville was fatal sharpsburg 1 my friend colonel means killed on the battle field his only son stark wounded and a prisoner his wife had not recovered from the death of her other child emma who had died of consumption early in the war she was lying on a bed when they told her of her husband's death and then they tried to keep stark's condition from her they think now that she misunderstood and believed him dead too she threw something over her face she did not utter one word she remained quiet so long some one removed the light shawl which she had thrown over her head and found she was dead miss mary stark her sister said afterward no wonder how was she to face life without her husband and children that was all she had ever lived for these are sad unfortunate memories let us run away from them what has not my husband been doing this year 1862 when all our south carolina troops are in virginia here we were without soldiers or arms he raised an army so to speak and imported arms through the trenholm firm he had arms to sell to the confederacy he laid the foundation of a niter bed and the confederacy sent to columbia to learn of professor le conte how to begin theirs he bought up all the old arms and had them altered and repaired he built ships he imported clothes and shoes for our soldiers for which things they had long stood sorely in need he imported cotton cards and set all idle hands carding and weaving all the world was set to spinning cotton he tried to stop the sale of whisky and alas he called for reserves that is men over age and he committed the unforgivable offense of sending the sacred negro property to work on fortifications away from their owners plantations
richmond va august 10 1863 to day i had letter from my sister who wrote to inquire about her old playmate friend and lover boykin mccaa it is nearly twenty years since each was married each now has children nearly grown to tell the truth she writes in these last dreadful years with david in florida where i can not often hear from him and everything dismal anxious and disquieting i had almost forgotten boykin's existence but he came here last night he stood by my bedside and spoke to me kindly and affectionately as if we had just parted i said holding out my hand boykin you are very pale he answered i have come to tell you good by and then seized both my hands his own hands were as cold and hard as ice they froze the marrow of my bones i screamed again and again until my whole household came rushing in and then came the negroes from the yard all wakened by my piercing shrieks this may have been a dream but it haunts me some one sent me an old paper with an account of his wounds and his recovery but i know he is dead stop said my husband at this point and then he read from that day's examiner these words captain burwell boykin mccaa found dead upon the battle field leading a cavalry charge at the head of his company he was shot through the head the famous colonel of the fourth texas by name john bell hood 1 is here him we call sam because his classmates at west point did so for what cause is not known john darby asked if he might bring his hero to us bragged of him extensively said he had won his three stars etc under stonewall's eye and that he was promoted by stonewall's request when hood came with his sad quixote face the face of an old crusader who believed in his cause his cross and his crown we were not prepared for such a man as a beau ideal of the wild texans he is tall thin and shy has blue eyes and light hair a tawny beard and a vast amount of it covering the lower part of his face the whole appearance that of awkward strength some one said that his great reserve of manner he carried only into the society of ladies major venable added that he had often heard of the light of battle shining in a man's eyes he had seen it once when he carried to hood orders from lee and found in the hottest of the fight that the man was transfigured the fierce light of hood's eyes i can never forget hood came to ask us to a picnic next day at drury's bluff 2 the naval heroes were to receive us and then we were to drive out to the texan camp we accused john darby of having instigated this unlooked for festivity we were to have bands of music and dances with turkeys chickens and buffalo tongues to eat next morning just as my foot was on the carriage step the girls standing behind ready to follow me with johnny and the infant samuel captain shannon by proper name up rode john darby in red hot haste threw his bridle to one of the men who was holding the horses and came toward us rapidly clanking his cavalry spurs with a despairing sound as he cried stop it's all up we are ordered back to the rappahannock the brigade is marching through richmond now so we unpacked and unloaded dismissed the hacks and sat down with a sigh suppose we go and see them pass the turnpike some one said the suggestion was hailed with delight and off we marched johnny and the infant were in citizens clothes and the straggler as hood calls john darby since the prestons have been in richmond was all plaided and plumed in his surgeon's array he never bated an inch of bullion or a feather he was courting and he stalked ahead with mary preston buck and johnny the infant and myself both stout and scant of breath lagged last they called back to us as the infant came toddling along hurry up or we will leave you at the turnpike we stood on the sidewalk and saw ten thousand men march by we had seen nothing like this before hitherto we had seen only regiments marching spick and span in their fresh smart clothes just from home and on their way to the army such rags and tags as we saw now nothing was like anything else most garments and arms were such as had been taken from the enemy such shoes as they had on oh our brave boys moaned buck such tin pans and pots as were tied to their waists with bread or bacon stuck on the ends of their bayonets anything that could be spiked was bayoneted and held aloft they did not seem to mind their shabby condition they laughed shouted and cheered as they marched by not a disrespectful or light word was spoken but they went for the men who were huddled behind us and who seemed to be trying to make themselves as small as possible in order to escape observation hood and his staff finally came galloping up dismounted and joined us mary preston gave him a bouquet thereupon he unwrapped a bible which he carried in his pocket he said his mother had given it to him he pressed a flower in it mary preston suggested that he had not worn or used it at all being fresh new and beautifully kept every word of this the texans heard as they marched by almost touching us they laughed and joked and made their own rough comments
august 2d sherman again artillery parked and a line of battle formed before atlanta when we asked brewster what sam meant to do at atlanta he answered oh oh like the man who went he says he means to stay there hope he may that's all spent to day with mrs mccord at her hospital she is dedicating her grief for her son sanctifying it one might say by giving up her soul and body her days and nights to the wounded soldiers at her hospital every moment of her time is surrendered to their needs to day general taliaferro dined with us he served with hood at the second battle of manassas and at fredericksburg where hood won his major general's spurs on the battle field hood he said has military inspiration we were thankful for that word all now depends on that army at atlanta if that fails us the game is up august 3d yesterday was such a lucky day for my housekeeping in our hired house oh ye kind columbia folk mrs alex taylor née hayne sent me a huge bowl of yellow butter and a basket to match of every vegetable in season mrs preston's man came with mushrooms freshly cut and mrs tom taylor's with fine melons sent smith and johnson my house servant and a carpenter from home respectively to the commissary's with our wagon for supplies they made a mistake so they said and went to the depot instead and stayed there all day i needed a servant sadly in many ways all day long but i hope smith and johnson had a good time i did not lose patience until harriet came in an omnibus because i had neither servants nor horse to send to the station for her stephen elliott is wounded and his wife and father have gone to him six hundred of his men were destroyed in a mine and part of his brigade taken prisoners stoneman and his raiders have been captured this last fact gives a slightly different hue to our horizon of unmitigated misery general l told us of an unpleasant scene at the president's last winter he called there to see mrs mclean mrs davis was in the room and he did not speak to her he did not intend to be rude it was merely an oversight and so he called again and tried to apologize to remedy his blunder but the president was inexorable and would not receive his overtures of peace and good will general l is a new york man talk of the savagery of slavery heavens how perfect are our men's manners down here how suave how polished are they fancy one of them forgetting to speak to mrs davis in her own drawing room august 6th archer came a classmate of my husband's at princeton they called him sally archer then he was so girlish and pretty no trace of feminine beauty about this grim soldier now he has a hard face black bearded and sallow with the saddest black eyes his hands are small white and well shaped his manners quiet he is abstracted and weary looking his mind and body having been deadened by long imprisonment he seemed glad to be here and james chesnut was charmed dear sally archer he calls him cheerily and the other responds in a far off faded kind of way hood and archer were given the two texas regiments at the beginning of the war they were colonels and wigfall was their general archer's comments on hood are he does not compare intellectually with general johnston who is decidedly a man of culture and literary attainments with much experience in military matters hood however has youth and energy to help counterbalance all this he has a simple minded directness of purpose always he is awfully shy and he has suffered terribly but then he has had consolations such a rapid rise in his profession and then his luck to be engaged to the beautiful miss they tried archer again and again on the heated controversy of the day but he stuck to his text joe johnston is a fine military critic a capital writer an accomplished soldier as brave as cæsar in his own person but cautious to a fault in manipulating an army hood has all the dash end fire of a reckless young soldier and his texans would follow him to the death too much caution might be followed easily by too much headlong rush that is where the swing back of the pendulum might ruin us august 10th to day general chesnut and his staff departed his troops are ordered to look after the mountain passes beyond greenville on the north carolina and tennessee quarter misery upon misery mobile1 is going as new orleans went those western men have not held their towns as we held and hold charleston or as the virginians hold richmond and they call us a frill shirt silk stocking chivalry or a set of dandy miss nancys they fight desperately in their bloody street brawls but we bear privation and discipline best august 14th we have conflicting testimony young wade hampton of joe johnston's staff says hood lost 12,000 men in the battles of the 22d1 and 24th but brewster of hood's staff says not three thousand at the utmost now here are two people strictly truthful who tell things so differently in this war people see the same things so oddly one does not know what to believe brewster says when he was in richmond mr davis said johnston would have to be removed and sherman blocked he could not make hardee full general because when he had command of an army he was always importuning the war department for a general in chief to be sent there over him polk would not do brave soldier and patriot as he was he was a good soldier and would do his best for his country and do his duty under whomever was put over him by those in authority mr davis did not once intimate to him who it was that he intended to promote to the head of the western army brewster said to day that this blow at joe johnston cutting off his head ruins the schemes of the enemies of the government wigfall asked me to go at once and get hood to decline to take this command for it will destroy him if he accepts it he will have to fight under jeff davis's orders no one can do that now and not lose caste in the western army joe johnston does not exactly say that jeff davis betrays his plans to the enemy but he says he dares not let the president know his plans as there is a spy in the war office who invariably warns the yankees in time consulting the government on military movements is played out that's wigfall's way of talking now added brewster i blame the president for keeping a man at the head of his armies who treats the government with open scorn and contumely no matter how the people at large rate this disrespectful general august 19th began my regular attendance on the wayside hospital to day we gave wounded men as they stopped for an hour at the station their breakfast those who are able to come to the table do so the badly wounded remain in wards prepared for them where their wounds are dressed by nurses and surgeons and we take bread and butter beef ham and hot coffee to them one man had hair as long as a woman's the result of a vow he said he had pledged himself not to cut his hair until peace was declared and our southern country free four made this vow together all were dead but himself one was killed in missouri one in virginia and he left one at kennesaw mountain this poor creature had had one arm taken off at the socket when i remarked that he was utterly disabled and ought not to remain in the army he answered quietly i am of the first texas if old hood can go with one foot i can go with one arm eh how they quarreled and wrangled among themselves alabama and mississippi all were loud for joe johnston save and except the long haired one armed hero who cried at the top of his voice oh you all want to be kept in trenches and to go on retreating eh oh if we had had a leader such as stonewall this war would have been over long ago what we want is a leader shouted a cripple they were awfully smashed up objects of misery wounded maimed diseased i was really upset and came home ill this kind of thing unnerves me quite letters from the army grant's dogged stay about richmond is very disgusting and depressing to the spirits wade hampton has been put in command of the southern cavalry a wayside incident a pine box covered with flowers was carefully put upon the train by some gentlemen isabella asked whose remains were in the box dr gibbes replied in that box lies the body of a young man whose family antedates the bourbons of france he was the last count de choiseul and he has died for the south let his memory be held in perpetual remembrance by all who love the south august 22d hope i may never know a raid except from hearsay mrs huger describes the one at athens the proudest and most timid of women were running madly in the streets corsets in one hand stockings in the other déshabillé as far as it will go mobile is half taken the railroad between us and richmond has been tapped notes from a letter written by a young lady who is riding a high horse her fiancé a maimed hero has been abused you say to me with a sneer so you love that man yes i do and i thank god that i love better than all the world the man who is to be my husband proud of him are you yes i am in exact proportion to my love you say i am selfish yes i am selfish he is my second self so utterly absorbed am i in him there is not a moment day or night that i do not think of him in point of fact i do not think of anything else no reply was deemed necessary by the astounded recipient of this outburst of indignation who showed me the letter and continued to observe did you ever she seems so shy so timid so cold sunday isabella took us to a chapel methodist of course her father had a hand in building it it was not clean but it was crowded hot and stuffy an eloquent man preached with a delightful voice and wonderful fluency nearly eloquent and at times nearly ridiculous he described a scene during one of his sermons when beautiful young faces were turned up to me radiant faces though bathed in tears moral rainbows of emotion playing over them etc he then described his own conversion and stripped himself naked morally all that is very revolting to one's innate sense of decency he tackled the patriarchs adam noah and so on down to joseph who was a man whose modesty and purity were so transcendent they enabled him to resist the greatest temptation to which fallen man is exposed fiddlesticks that is played out my neighbor whispered everybody gives up now that old mrs pharaoh was forty mrs potiphar you goose and she was fifty that solves the riddle sh sh from the devout isabella at home met general preston on the piazza he was vastly entertaining gave us darwin herodotus and livy we understood him and were delighted but we did not know enough to be sure when it was his own wisdom or when wise saws and cheering words came from the authors of whom he spoke august 23d all in a muddle and yet the news confused as it is seems good from all quarters there is a row in new orleans memphis1 has been retaken 2,000 prisoners have been captured at petersburg and a yankee raid on macon has come to grief at mrs izard's met a clever mrs calhoun mrs calhoun is a violent partizan of dick taylor says taylor does the work and kirby smith gets the credit for it mrs calhoun described the behavior of some acquaintance of theirs at shreveport one of that kind whose faith removes mountains her love for and confidence in the confederate army were supreme why not she knew so many of the men who composed that dauntless band when her husband told her new orleans had surrendered to a foe whom she despised she did not believe a word of it he told her to pack up his traps as it was time for him to leave shreveport she then determined to run down to the levee and see for herself only to find the yankee gunboats having it all their own way she made a painful exhibition of herself first she fell on her knees and prayed then she got up and danced with rage then she raved and dashed herself on the ground in a fit there was patriotism run mad for you as i did not know the poor soul mrs calhoun's fine acting was somewhat lost on me but the others enjoyed it old edward johnston has been sent to atlanta against his will and archer has been made major general and contrary to his earnest request ordered not to his beloved texans but to the army of the potomac mr c f hampton deplores the untimely end of mcpherson 1 he was so kind to mr hampton at vicksburg last winter and drank general hampton's health then and there mr hampton has asked brewster if the report of his death prove a mistake and general mcpherson is a prisoner that every kindness and attention be shown to him general mcpherson said at his own table at vicksburg that general hampton was the ablest general on our side grant can hold his own as well as sherman lee has a heavy handful in the new suwarrow he has worse odds than any one else for when grant has ten thousand slain he has only to order another ten thousand and they are there ready to step out to the front they are like the leaves of vallambrosa august 29th i take my hospital duty in the morning most persons prefer afternoon but i dislike to give up my pleasant evenings so i get up at five o'clock and go down in my carriage all laden with provisions mrs fisher and old mr bryan generally go with me provisions are commonly sent by people to mrs fisher's i am so glad to be a hospital nurse once more i had excuses enough but at heart i felt a coward and a skulker i think i know how men feel who hire a substitute and shirk the fight there must be no dodging of duty it will not do now to send provisions and pay for nurses something inside of me kept calling out go you shabby creature you can't bear to see what those fine fellows have to bear mrs izard was staying with me last night and as i slipped away i begged molly to keep everything dead still and not let mrs izard be disturbed until i got home about ten i drove up and there was a row to wake the dead molly's eldest daughter who nurses her baby sister let the baby fall and regardless of mrs izard as i was away molly was giving the nurse a switching in the yard accompanied by howls and yells worthy of a comanche the small nurse welcomed my advent no doubt for in two seconds peace was restored mrs izard said she sympathized with the baby's mother so i forgave the uproar i have excellent servants no matter for their short comings behind my back they save me all thought as to household matters and they are so kind attentive and quiet they must know what is at hand if sherman is not hindered from coming here freedom my masters but these sphinxes give no sign unless it be increased diligence and absolute silence as certain in their action and as noiseless as a law of nature at any rate when we are in the house that fearful hospital haunts me all day long and is worse at night so much suffering such loathsome wounds such distortion with stumps of limbs not half cured exhibited to all then when i was so tired yesterday molly was looking more like an enraged lioness than anything else roaring that her baby's neck was broken and howling cries of vengeance the poor little careless nurse's dark face had an ashen tinge of gray terror she was crouching near the ground like an animal trying to hide and her mother striking at her as she rolled away all this was my welcome as i entered the gate it takes these half africans but a moment to go back to their naked savage animal nature mrs izard is a charming person she tried so to make me forget it all and rest
september 1st north carolina writes for arms for her soldiers have we any to send no brewster the plainspoken says the president is ill and our affairs are in the hands of noodles all the generals away with the army nobody here general lee in western virginia reading the third psalm the devil is sick the devil a saint would be lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me september 2d mr miles says he is not going anywhere at all not even home he is to sit here permanently chairman of a committee to overhaul camps commissariats etc etc we exchanged our ideas of mr mason in which we agreed perfectly in the first place he has a noble presence really a handsome man is a manly old virginian straightforward brave truthful clever the very beau ideal of an independent high spirited f f v if the english value a genuine man they will have one here in every particular he is the exact opposite of talleyrand he has some peculiarities he had never an ache or a pain himself his physique is perfect and he loudly declares that he hates to see persons ill seems to him an unpardonable weakness it began to grow late many people had come to say good by to me i had fever as usual to day but in the excitement of this crowd of friends the invalid forgot fever mr chesnut held up his watch to me warningly and intimated it was late indeed for one who has to travel tomorrow so as the yankees say after every defeat i retired in good order not quite for i forgot handkerchief and fan gonzales rushed after and met me at the foot of the stairs in his foreign pathetic polite high bred way he bowed low and said he had made an excuse for the fan for he had a present to make me and then though startled and amazed i paused and on the stranger gazed alas i am a woman approaching forty and the offering proved to be a bottle of cherry bounce nothing could have been more opportune and with a little ice etc will help i am sure to save my life on that dreadful journey home no discouragement now felt at the north they take our forts and are satisfied for a while then the english are strictly neutral like the woman who saw her husband fight the bear it was the first fight she ever saw when she did not care who whipped mr davis was very kind about it all he told mr chesnut to go home and have an eye to all the state defenses etc and that he would give him any position he asked for if he still wished to continue in the army now this would be all that heart could wish but mr chesnut will never ask for anything what will he ask for that's the rub i am certain of very few things in life now but this is one i am certain of mr chesnut will never ask mortal man for any promotion for himself or for one of his own family camden s c september 9,1861 home again at mulberry the fever in full possession of me my sister kate is my ideal woman the most agreeable person i know in the world with her soft low and sweet voice her graceful gracious ways and her glorious gray eyes that i looked into so often as we confided our very souls to each other god bless old betsey's yellow face she is a nurse in a thousand and would do anything for mars jeems wife my small ailments in all this comfort set me mourning over the dead and dying soldiers i saw in virginia how feeble my compassion proves after all i handed the old colonel a letter from his son in the army he said as he folded up the missive from the seat of war with this war we may die out your husband is the last of my family he means that my husband is his only living son his grandsons are in the army and they too may be killed even johnny the gallant and gay may not be bullet proof no child have i now this old man of ninety years was born when it was not the fashion for a gentleman to be a saint and being lord of all he surveyed for so many years irresponsible in the center of his huge domain it is wonderful he was not a greater tyrant the softening influence of that angel wife no doubt saint or sinner he understands the world about him au fond have had a violent attack of something wrong about my heart it stopped beating then it took to trembling creaking and thumping like a mississippi high pressure steamboat and the noise in my ears was more like an ammunition wagon rattling over the stones in richmond that was yesterday and yet i am alive that kind of thing makes one feel very mortal russell writes how disappointed prince jerome napoleon was with the appearance of our troops and he did not like beauregard at all well i give bogar up to him but how a man can find fault with our soldiers as i have seen them individually and collectively in charleston richmond and everywhere that beats me the british are the most conceited nation in the world the most self sufficient self satisfied and arrogant but each individual man does not blow his own penny whistle they brag wholesale wellington he certainly left it for others to sound his praises though mr binney thought the statue of napoleon at the entrance of apsley house was a little like who killed cock robin i said the sparrow with my bow and arrow but then it is so pleasant to hear them when it is a lump sum of praise with no private crowing praise of trafalgar waterloo the scots greys fighting this and fighting that with their crack corps stirs the blood and every heart responds three times three hurrah but our people feel that they must send forth their own reported prowess with an i did this and i did that i know they did it but i hang my head in those tarleton memoirs in lee's memoirs in moultrie's and in lord rawdon's letters self is never brought to the front i have been reading them over and admire their modesty and good taste as much as their courage and cleverness that kind of british eloquence takes me it is not soldats marchons gloire not a bit of it but now my lads stand firm and now up and let them have it our name has not gone out of print to day the examiner as usual pitches into the president it thinks toombs cobb slidell lamar or chesnut would have been far better in the office there is considerable choice in that lot five men more utterly dissimilar were never named in the same paragraph september 19th a painful piece of news came to us yesterday our cousin mrs witherspoon of society hill was found dead in her bed she was quite well the night before killed people say by family sorrows she was a proud and high strung woman nothing shabby in word thought or deed ever came nigh her she was of a warm and tender heart too truth and uprightness itself few persons have ever been more loved and looked up to she was a very handsome old lady of fine presence dignified and commanding killed by family sorrows so they said when mrs john n williams died so uncle john said yesterday of his brother burwell death deserts the army said that quaint old soul and takes fancy shots of the most eccentric kind nearer home the high and disinterested conduct our enemies seem to expect of us is involuntary and unconscious praise they pay us the compliment to look for from us and execrate us for the want of it a degree of virtue they were never able to practise themselves it is a crowning misdemeanor for us to hold still in slavery those africans whom they brought here from africa or sold to us when they found it did not pay to own them themselves gradually they slid or sold them off down here or freed them prospectively giving themselves years in which to get rid of them in a remunerative way we want to spread them over other lands too west and south or northwest where the climate would free them or kill them or improve them out of the world as our friends up north do the indians if they had been forced to keep the negroes in new england i dare say the negroes might have shared the indians fate for they are wise in their generation these yankee children of light those pernicious africans so have just spoken mr chesnut and uncle john both ci devant union men now utterly for state rights it is queer how different the same man may appear viewed from different standpoints what a perfect gentleman said one person of another so fine looking high bred distinguished easy free and above all graceful in his bearing so high toned he is always indignant at any symptom of wrong doing he is charming the man of all others i like to have strangers see a noble representative of our country yes every word of that is true was the reply he is all that and then the other side of the picture is true too you can always find him you know where to find him wherever there is a looking glass a bottle or a woman there will he be also my god and you call yourself his friend yes i know him down to the ground this conversation i overheard from an upper window when looking down on the piazza below a complicated character truly beyond la bruyère with what mrs preston calls refinement spread thin until it is skin deep only an iron steamer has run the blockade at savannah we now raise our wilted heads like flowers after a shower this drop of good news revives us
september 7th major edward johnston did not get into the confederacy until after the first battle of manassas for some cause before he could evade that potentate seward rang his little bell and sent him to a prison in the harbor of new york i forget whether he was exchanged or escaped of his own motion the next thing i heard of my antebellum friend he had defeated milroy in western virginia there were so many johnstons that for this victory they named him alleghany johnston he had an odd habit of falling into a state of incessant winking as soon as he became the least startled or agitated in such times he seemed persistently to be winking one eye at you he meant nothing by it and in point of fact did not know himself that he was doing it in mexico he had been wounded in the eye and the nerve vibrates independently of his will during the winter of 1862 and 1863 he was on crutches after a while he hobbled down franklin street with us we proud to accommodate our pace to that of the wounded general his ankle continued stiff so when he sat down another chair had to be put before him on this he stretched out his stiff leg straight as a ramrod at that time he was our only wounded knight and the girls waited on him and made life pleasant for him one night i listened to two love tales at once in a distracted state of mind between the two william porcher miles in a perfectly modulated voice in cadenced accents and low tones was narrating the happy end of his affair he had been engaged to sweet little bettie bierne and i gave him my congratulations with all my heart it was a capital match suitable in every way good for her and good for him i was deeply interested in mr miles's story but there was din and discord on the other hand old edward our pet general sat diagonally across the room with one leg straight out like a poker wrapped in red carpet leggings as red as a turkey cock in the face his head is strangely shaped like a cone or an old fashioned beehive or as buck said there are three tiers of it it is like a pope's tiara there he sat with a loud voice and a thousand winks making love to mary p i make no excuse for listening it was impossible not to hear him i tried not to lose a word of mr miles's idyl as the despair of the veteran was thundered into my other ear i lent an ear to each conversationalist mary can not altogether control her voice and her shrill screams of negation no no never etc utterly failed to suppress her wounded lover's obstreperous asseverations of his undying affection for her buck said afterward we heard every word of it on our side of the room even when mamie shrieked to him that he was talking too loud now mamie said we afterward do you think it was kind to tell him he was forty if he was a day strange to say the pet general edward rehabilitated his love in a day at least two days after he was heard to say that he was paying attentions now to his cousin john preston's second daughter her name sally but they called her buck sally buchanan campbell preston a lovely girl and with her he now drove rode and hobbled on his crutches sent her his photograph and in due time cannonaded her from the same spot where he had courted mary with proposals to marry him buck was never so decided in her nos as mary not so loud at least thus in amendment says buck who always reads what i have written and makes comments of assent or dissent so again he began to thunder in a woman's ears his tender passion as they rode down franklin street buck says she knows the people on the sidewalk heard snatches of the conversation though she rode as rapidly as she could and she begged him not to talk so loud finally they dashed up to our door as if they had been running a race unfortunate in love but fortunate in war our general is now winning new laurels with ewell in the valley or with the army of the potomac i think i have told how miles still so gently o'er me leaning told of his successful love while general edward johnston roared unto anguish and disappointment over his failures mr miles spoke of sweet little bettie bierne as if she had been a french girl just from a convent kept far from the haunts of men wholly for him one would think to hear him that bettie had never cast those innocent blue eyes of hers on a man until he came along now since i first knew miss bierne in 1857 when pat calhoun was to the fore she has been followed by a tale of men as long as a highland chief's every summer at the springs their father appeared in the ballroom a little before twelve and chased the three beautiful biernes home before him in spite of all entreaties and he was said to frown away their too numerous admirers at all hours of the day this new engagement was confided to me as a profound secret of course i did not mention it even to my own household next day little alston morgan's adjutant and george deas called as colonel deas removed his gloves he said oh the miles and bierne sensation have you heard of it no what is the row about they are engaged to be married that's all who told you miles himself as we walked down franklin street this afternoon and did he not beg you not to mention it as bettie did not wish it spoken of god bless my soul so he did and i forgot that part entirely colonel alston begged the stout carolinian not to take his inadvertent breach of faith too much to heart miss bettie's engagement had caused him a dreadful night a young man who was his intimate friend came to his room in the depths of despair and handed him a letter from miss bierne which was the cause of all his woe not knowing that she was already betrothed to miles he had proposed to her in an eloquent letter in her reply she positively stated that she was engaged to mr miles and instead of thanking her for putting him at once out of his misery he considered the reason she gave as trebly aggravating the agony of the love letter and the refusal too late he yelled by jingo so much for a secret miss bierne and i became fast friends our friendship was based on a mutual admiration for the honorable member from south carolina colonel and mrs myers and colonel and mrs chesnut were the only friends of mr miles who were invited to the wedding at the church door the sexton demanded our credentials no one but those whose names he held in his hand were allowed to enter not twenty people were present a mere handful grouped about the altar in that large church we were among the first to arrive then came a faint flutter and mrs parkman the bride's sister swathed in weeds for her young husband who had been killed within a year of her marriage came rapidly up the aisle alone she dropped upon her knees in the front pew and there remained motionless during the whole ceremony a mass of black crepe and a dead weight on my heart she has had experience of war a cannonade around richmond interrupted her marriage service a sinister omen and in a year thereafter her bridegroom was stiff and stark dead upon the field of battle while the wedding march turned our thoughts from her and thrilled us with sympathy the bride advanced in white satin and point d'alençon mrs myers whispered that it was mrs parkman's wedding dress that the bride had on she remembered the exquisite lace and she shuddered with superstitious forebodings all had been going on delightfully in doors but a sharp shower cleared the church porch of the curious and as the water splashed we wondered how we were to assemble ourselves at mrs mcfarland's all the horses in richmond had been impressed for some sudden cavalry necessity a few days before i ran between mr mcfarland and senator semmes with my pretty paris rose colored silk turned over my head to save it and when we arrived at the hospitable mansion of the mcfarlands mr mcfarland took me straight into the drawing room man like forgetting that my ruffled plumes needed a good smoothing and preening mrs lee sent for me she was staying at mrs caskie's i was taken directly to her room where she was lying on the bed she said before i had taken my seat you know there is a fight going on now at brandy station 1 yes we are anxious john chesnut's company is there too she spoke sadly but quietly my son roony is wounded his brother has gone for him they will soon be here and we shall know all about it unless roony's wife takes him to her grandfather poor lame mother i am useless to my children mrs caskie said you need not be alarmed the general said in his telegram that it was not a severe wound you know even yankees believe general lee that day mrs lee gave me a likeness of the general in a photograph taken soon after the mexican war she likes it so much better than the later ones he certainly was a handsome man then handsomer even than now i shall prize it for mrs lee's sake too she said old mrs chesnut and her aunt nellie custis mrs lewis were very intimate during washington's administration in philadelphia i told her mrs chesnut senior was the historical member of our family she had so much to tell of revolutionary times she was one of the white robed choir of little maidens who scattered flowers before washington at trenton bridge which everybody who writes a life of washington asks her to give an account of mrs ould and mrs davis came home with me lawrence had a basket of delicious cherries if there were only some ice said i respectfully lawrence answered and also firmly give me money and you shall have ice by the underground telegraph he had heard of an ice house over the river though its fame was suppressed by certain sybarites as they wanted it all in a wonderfully short time we had mint juleps and sherry cobblers altogether it has been a pleasant day and as i sat alone i was laughing lightly now and then at the memory of some funny story suddenly a violent ring and a regular sheaf of telegrams were handed me i could not have drawn away in more consternation if the sheets had been a nest of rattlesnakes first frank hampton was killed at brandy station wade hampton telegraphed mr chesnut to see robert barnwell and make the necessary arrangements to recover the body mr chesnut is still at wilmington i sent for preston johnston and my neighbor colonel patton offered to see that everything proper was done that afternoon i walked out alone willie mountford had shown me where the body all that was left of frank hampton was to be laid in the capitol mrs petticola joined me after a while and then mrs singleton preston hampton and peter trezevant with myself and mrs singleton formed the sad procession which followed the coffin there was a company of soldiers drawn up in front of the state house porch mrs singleton said we had better go in and look at him before the coffin was finally closed how i wish i had not looked i remember him so well in all the pride of his magnificent manhood he died of a saber cut across the face and head and was utterly disfigured mrs singleton seemed convulsed with grief in all my life i had never seen such bitter weeping she had her own troubles but i did not know of them we sat for a long time on the great steps of the state house everybody had gone and we were alone we talked of it all how we had gone to charleston to see rachel in adrienne lecouvreur and how as i stood waiting in the passage near the drawing room i had met frank hampton bringing his beautiful bride from the steamer they had just landed afterward at mrs singleton's place in the country we had all spent a delightful week together and now only a few years have passed but nearly all that pleasant company are dead and our world the only world we cared for literally kicked to pieces and she cried we are two lone women stranded here rev robert barnwell was in a desperate condition and mary barnwell her daughter was expecting her confinement every day here now later let me add that it was not until i got back to carolina that i heard of robert barnwell's death with scarcely a day's interval between it and that of mary and her new born baby husband wife and child were buried at the same time in the same grave in columbia and now mrs singleton has three orphan grandchildren what a woful year it has been to her robert barnwell had insisted upon being sent to the hospital at staunton on account of his wife's situation the doctor also had advised it he was carried off on a mattress his brave wife tried to prevent it and said it is only fever and she nursed him to the last she tried to say good by cheerfully and called after him as soon as my trouble is over i will come to you at staunton at the hospital they said it was typhoid fever he died the second day after he got there poor mary fainted when she heard the ambulance drive away with him then she crept into a low trundle bed kept for the children in her mother's room she never left that bed again when the message came from staunton that fever was the matter with robert and nothing more mrs singleton says she will never forget the expression in mary's eyes as she turned and looked at her robert will get well she said it is all right her face was radiant blazing with light that night the baby was born and mrs singleton got a telegram that robert was dead she did not tell mary standing as she did at the window while she read it she was at the same time looking for robert's body which might come any moment as for mary's life being in danger she had never thought of such a thing she was thinking only of robert then a servant touched her and said look at mrs barnwell she ran to the bedside and the doctor who had come in said it is all over she is dead not in anger not in wrath came the angel of death that day he came to set mary free from a world grown too hard to bear during stoneman's raid1 i burned some personal papers molly constantly said to me missis listen to de guns burn up everything mrs lyons says they are sure to come and they'll put in their newspapers whatever you write here every day the guns did sound very near and when mrs davis rode up and told me that if mr davis left richmond i must go with her i confess i lost my head so i burned a part of my journal but rewrote it afterward from memory my implacable enemy that lets me forget none of the things i would i am weak with dates i do not always worry to look at the calendar and write them down besides i have not always a calendar at hand camden s c september 10,1863 it is a comfort to turn from small political jealousies to our grand battles to lee and kirby smith after council and convention squabbles lee has proved to be all that my husband prophesied of him when he was so unpopular and when joe johnston was the great god of war the very sound of the word convention or council is wearisome not that i am quite ready for richmond yet we must look after home and plantation affairs which we have sadly neglected heaven help my husband through the deep waters the wedding of miss aiken daughter of governor aiken the largest slave owner in south carolina julia rutledge one of the bridesmaids the place flat rock we could not for a while imagine what julia would do for a dress my sister kate remembered some muslin she had in the house for curtains bought before the war and laid aside as not needed now the stuff was white and thin a little coarse but then we covered it with no end of beautiful lace it made a charming dress and how altogether lovely julia looked in it the night of the wedding it stormed as if the world were coming to an end wind rain thunder and lightning in an unlimited supply around the mountain cottage the bride had a duchesse dressing table muslin and lace not one of the shifts of honest war driven poverty but a millionaire's attempt at appearing economical in the idea that that style was in better taste as placing the family more on the same plane with their less comfortable compatriots a candle was left too near this light drapery and it took fire outside was lightning enough to fire the world inside the bridal chamber was ablaze and there was wind enough to blow the house down the mountainside the english maid behaved heroically and with the aid of mrs aiken's and mrs mat singleton's servants put the fire out without disturbing the marriage ceremony then being performed below everything in the bridal chamber was burned up except the bed and that was a mass of cinders soot and flakes of charred and blackened wood at kingsville i caught a glimpse of our army longstreet's corps was going west god bless the gallant fellows not one man was intoxicated not one rude word did i hear it was a strange sight one part of it there were miles apparently of platform cars soldiers rolled in their blankets lying in rows heads all covered fast asleep in their gray blankets packed in regular order they looked like swathed mummies one man near where i sat was writing on his knee he used his cap for a desk and he was seated on a rail i watched him wondering to whom that letter was to go home no doubt sore hearts for him there a feeling of awful depression laid hold of me all these fine fellows were going to kill or be killed why and a phrase got to beating about my head like an old song the unreturning brave when a knot of boyish laughing young creatures passed me a queer thrill of sympathy shook me ah i know how your home folks feel poor children once last winter persons came to us in camden with such strange stories of captain morgan's man stories of his father too turf tales and murder or at least how he killed people he had been a tremendous favorite with my husband who brought him in once leading him by the hand afterward he said to me with these girls in the house we must be more cautious i agreed to be coldly polite to after all i said i barely know him when he called afterward in richmond i was very glad to see him utterly forgetting that he was under a ban we had a long confidential talk he told me of his wife and children of his army career and told morgan stories he grew more and more cordial and so did i he thanked me for the kind reception given him in that house told me i was a true friend of his and related to me a scrape he was in which if divulged would ruin him although he was innocent but time would clear all things he begged me not to repeat anything he had told me of his affairs not even to colonel chesnut which i promised promptly and then he went away i sat poking the fire thinking what a curiously interesting creature he was this famous captain when the folding doors slowly opened and colonel chesnut appeared he had come home two hours ago from the war office with a headache and had been lying on the sofa behind that folding door listening for mortal hours so this is your style of being coldly polite he said fancy my feelings indeed i had forgotten all about what they had said of him the lies they told of him never once crossed my mind he is a great deal cleverer and i dare say just as good as those who malign him mattie reedy i knew her as a handsome girl in washington several years ago got tired of hearing federals abusing john morgan one day they were worse than ever in their abuse and she grew restive by way of putting a mark against the name of so rude a girl the yankee officer said what is your name write mattie reedy now but by the grace of god one day i hope to call myself the wife of john morgan she did not know morgan but morgan eventually heard the story a good joke it was said to be but he made it a point to find her out and as she was as pretty as she was patriotic by the grace of god she is now mrs morgan these timid southern women under the guns can be brave enough aunt charlotte has told a story of my dear mother they were up at shelby ala a white man's country where negroes are not wanted the ladies had with them several negroes belonging to my uncle at whose house they were staying in the owner's absence one negro man who had married and dwelt in a cabin was for some cause particularly obnoxious to the neighborhood my aunt and my mother old fashioned ladies shrinking from everything outside their own door knew nothing of all this they occupied rooms on opposite sides of an open passage way underneath the house was open and unfinished suddenly one night my aunt heard a terrible noise apparently as of a man running for his life pursued by men and dogs shouting hallowing barking she had only time to lock herself in utterly cut off from her sister she sat down dumb with terror when there began loud knocking at the door with men swearing dogs tearing round sniffing racing in and out of the passage and barking underneath the house like mad aunt charlotte was sure she heard the panting of a negro as he ran into the house a few minutes before what could have become of him where could he have hidden the men shook the doors and windows loudly threatening vengeance my aunt pitied her feeble sister cut off in the room across the passage this fright might kill her the cursing and shouting continued unabated a man's voice in harshest accents made itself heard above all leave my house you rascals said the voice if you are not gone in two seconds i'll shoot there was a dead silence except for the noise of the dogs quickly the men slipped away once out of gunshot they began to call their dogs after it was all over my aunt crept across the passage sister what man was it scared them away my mother laughed aloud in her triumph i am the man she said but where is john out crept john from a corner of the room where my mother had thrown some rubbish over him lawd bless you miss mary opened de do for me and dey was right behind runnin me aunt says mother was awfully proud of her prowess and she showed some moral courage too at the president's in richmond once general lee was there and constance and hetty cary came in also miss sanders and others constance cary1 was telling some war anecdotes among them one of an attempt to get up a supper the night before at some high and mighty f f v s house and of how several gentlefolks went into the kitchen to prepare something to eat by the light of one forlorn candle one of the men in the party not being of a useful temperament turned up a tub and sat down upon it custis lee wishing also to rest found nothing upon which to sit but a gridiron one remembrance i kept of the evening at the president's general lee bowing over the beautiful miss cary's hands in the passage outside miss rose to have her part in the picture and asked mr davis to walk with her into the adjoining drawing room he seemed surprised but rose stiffly and with a scowling brow was led off as they passed where mrs davis sat miss with all sail set looked back and said don't be jealous mrs davis i have an important communication to make to the president mrs davis's amusement resulted in a significant now did you ever during stoneman's raid on a sunday i was in mrs randolph's pew the battle of chancellorsville was also raging the rattling of ammunition wagons the tramp of soldiers the everlasting slamming of those iron gates of the capitol square just opposite the church made it hard to attend to the service then began a scene calculated to make the stoutest heart quail the sexton would walk quietly up the aisle to deliver messages to worshipers whose relatives had been brought in wounded dying or dead pale faced people would then follow him out finally the rev mr minnegerode bent across the chancel rail to the sexton for a few minutes whispered with the sexton and then disappeared the assistant clergyman resumed the communion which mr minnegerode had been administering at the church door stood mrs minnegerode as tragically wretched and as wild looking as ever mrs siddons was she managed to say to her husband your son is at the station dead when these agonized parents reached the station however it proved to be some one else's son who was dead but a son all the same pale and wan came mr minnegerode back to his place within the altar rails after the sacred communion was over some one asked him what it all meant and he said oh it was not my son who was killed but it came so near it aches me yet at home i found l q washington who stayed to dinner i saw that he and my husband were intently preoccupied by some event which they did not see fit to communicate to me immediately after dinner my husband lent mr washington one of his horses and they rode off together i betook myself to my kind neighbors the pattons for information there i found colonel patton had gone too mrs patton however knew all about the trouble she said there was a raiding party within forty miles of us and no troops were in richmond they asked me to stay to tea those kind ladies and in some way we might learn what was going on after tea we went out to the capitol square lawrence and three men servants going along to protect us they seemed to be mustering in citizens by the thousands company after company was being formed then battalions and then regiments it was a wonderful sight to us peering through the iron railing watching them fall into ranks then we went to the president's finding the family at supper we sat on the white marble steps and general elzey told me exactly how things stood and of our immediate danger pickets were coming in men were spurring to and from the door as fast as they could ride bringing and carrying messages and orders calmly general elzey discoursed upon our present weakness and our chances for aid after a while mrs davis came out and embraced me silently it is dreadful i said the enemy is within forty miles of us only forty who told you that tale said she they are within three miles of richmond i went down on my knees like a stone you had better be quiet she said the president is ill women and children must not add to the trouble she asked me to stay all night which i was thankful to do we sat up officers were coming and going and we gave them what refreshment we could from a side table kept constantly replenished finally in the excitement the constant state of activity and change of persons we forgot the danger officers told us jolly stories and seemed in fine spirits so we gradually took heart there was not a moment's rest for any one mrs davis said something more amusing than ever we look like frightened women and children don't we early next morning the president came down he was still feeble and pale from illness custis lee and my husband loaded their pistols and the president drove off in dr garnett's carriage my husband and custis lee on horseback alongside him by eight o'clock the troops from petersburg came in and the danger was over the authorities will never strip richmond of troops again we had a narrow squeeze for it but we escaped it was a terrible night although we made the best of it i was walking on franklin street when i met my husband come with me to the war office for a few minutes said he and then i will go home with you what could i do but go he took me up a dark stairway and then down a long dark corridor and he left me sitting in a window saying he would not be gone a second he was obliged to go into the secretary of war's room there i sat mortal hours men came to light the gas from the first i put down my veil so that nobody might know me numbers of persons passed that i knew but i scarcely felt respectable seated up there in that odd way so i said not a word but looked out of the window judge campbell slowly walked up and down with his hands behind his back the saddest face i ever saw he had jumped down in his patriotism from judge of the supreme court u s a to be under secretary of something or other i do not know what c s a no wonder he was out of spirits that night finally judge ould came him i called and he joined me at once in no little amazement to find me there and stayed with me until james chesnut appeared in point of fact i sent him to look up that stray member of my family when my husband came he said oh mr seddon and i got into an argument and time slipped away the truth is i utterly forgot you were here when we were once more out in the street he began now don't scold me for there is bad news pemberton has been fighting the yankees by brigades and he has been beaten every time and now vicksburg must go i suppose that was his side of the argument with seddon once again i visited the war office i went with mrs ould to see her husband at his office we wanted to arrange a party on the river on the flag of truce boat and to visit those beautiful places claremont and brandon my husband got into one of his too careful fits said there was risk in it and so he upset all our plans then i was to go up to john rutherford's by the canal boat that too he vetoed too risky as if anybody was going to trouble us

oct 2 lewis had a flare up with the cap of his new position north edisto and like a foolish boy gave up his commission this distressed mr grimball very much and he persuaded himself that if lewis had time to reconsider this step he would repent so he got the department to allow it to remain until lewis could be communicated with we have not heard from lewis since but suppose he has determined to remain the pay is 13 hundred 20 a year the post is very out of the way and lewis did write but his letter was lost by the young man with his own papers the boat having swamped lotty is better she had the fever 14 days is now up better october 19 mrs butler was written to by her lawyer and came from the north by the way of washington where she got a permit from gen scott was forwarded to fortress monroe and from thence to norfolk where she arrived with a flag of truce she left cornelia at school at the north she looks very well is thinner than she was and still very handsome expects to go to georgia the last of the month to be there perhaps to the end of the war things seem to go on so slowly and are so ruinously low and high that i suppose at the end of it we shall be in a deplorable state i think it was all right to sepparate from the north but to us as a family it was just ruin the northern property was then sold and we were about to realize something from it the prices last fall were very high now this is all over and the attainment of positions are so difficult the boys have nothing to do now apart from the war john is a lieutenant which he greatly enjoys but william arthur are much in need of commissions they belong to militia companies they do not pay except on service the regular companies always pay always have something to do such a young man as william seems to deserve all distinction but it is not easily got how dreary life is how sinful we are there have been some interesting speeches in court about the sequestration of property of alien enemies mr pettegrew nelson mitchel on our side and others against their view mrs butler is at the mills house has dined here twice spends all her evenings with us her daughter is at her place at the north near philadelphia she comes on to secure her property after spending 3 weeks here she went on to savannah and had her business arranged to her satisfaction the yankee fleet attacked hilton head and bay point silenced the batteries there and are now in broad river the poor beaufort people fled in every direction leaving the town to be sacked by the negroes the batteries were abandoned it is now thought too soon and as is always the case where there is a failure it is considered mismanaged gen drayton trapier ripley lee has come on from virginia to take charge troops have come from north carolina to assist and they are waiting to protect the rail road the women were seized with a perfect panic and many fled into the interior such terror stricken creatures disgrace their revolutionary ancestry william berkley arthur are with their company encamped at the race ground every day or two they come in and i see them john paid us a visit and it was charming to see him he has been away all the summer berkley is not very enthusiastic about military affairs and finds the camp life perfectly horrible it is very amusing to hear him recount his annoyances damp hay to lie on such a hard bed was in a nice mess but did not know how to arrange paying his share got some tea sugar to put in and went off rather pleased charles has been passing the summer at savannah in the same house with miss emma miss clem wallister and not long since he offered himself to miss clem was accepted engaged 3 days when miss c found out she loved another charley not charley morris so c came here with mrs butler having business in savannah returned there and having a conversation with miss emma again reconciled himself to miss clem arrived here in a state of great beatitude was now engaged to be married on wednesday 20 nov on the 15 a telegram arrives telling him to come to savannah then another to come on alone so we are all in a maze fearing miss clem has again pranced off and charles went off yesterday was in savannah at 8 this morning he is so crazy to get married it is quite ridiculous ella says when clem first pranced off charles having just recovered from an attack of fever was terribly nervous miss emma herself had to administer nervines to him and sustain his sinking spirits on one occasion when miss emma left the room he said he thought it was a pity he had not addressed miss emma last summer richard who is here told ella charles felt himself very near dying and told r if that happened he must give all his effects to mrs nightingale which highly insenced mrs b who has always been very kind to c she says at any rate she would keep the things she had in charge the nightingales should not have them richard looks very well is very agreeable he is stouter improved in appearance papa mr grimball came to town on a visit both looking well reporting all quiet and going on as usual we are to stay here for the present mr grimball will be on the plantation keeping the negroes together i taking care of the girls the boys in the tented field the yankees have not made much progress a flag of truce came from the fleet to one of the batteries and one of the officers said they had no wish to disturb quiet loyal citizens the reply given by captain 0 barnwell was there were no such about there mr edward barnwell has his nephew cap w barnwell the son of the rev mr barnwell at his house desperately wounded by accident by a pistol said to be a very clever young man his mother sisters are with him a very sad case arthur made 51 in the medical director's office which enabled him to purchase with others a tent john is in wapoo with his davis john is now here with his davis quite busy happy charles has married miss mcallister and brought her here clementina as she chooses to be called a woman of the world of good family in peace times would have 40 thousand dollars has red hair a good figure add is a sensible educated woman quite accustomed to society and will manage charles take care of his money make him very happy mr grimball writes that pinebury is a military station and seems to be having an interesting time there entertaining the officers there is a detatchment of cavalry on the lawn 2 6 pounders at the bain landing a bridge of flats accross the river i think we are in dark trying times and i am afraid the people of the sea board so loud in their expressions of determination while the war is in virginia feel very faint now that it has come upon us the yankees have landed on tybee put up the flag so these two states georgia south carolina have now the flag of the enemy floating on their coasts in florida they have brag to fight it out on the coast pensicola fortunately for them gen drayton trapier are not men to be depended on they have not heads to command gen lee who was thought slow said to be a grand general he is superior over all the camp seems to be a nice place william who has lost his watch a gift from me i think through carelessness says they live very well in his mess he looks very well indeed
10th october we went to church on communion sunday and saw miss clemy legg in deep black what a pity the poor thing was not married to mr palmer papa talks of going down to his plantation to settle his affairs if he has to move his negroes he will send them to georgia to richard i told him if he had no further need to be on his place that we should be very glad to have him stay with us and that i had enjoyed his being with us this summer he said he felt very grateful for all the kindness shewn him and would always remember it that it was pleasant to think of elizabeth had a nice little visit to miss juliet and rode to glen springs when she returned she took cold and had a sore throat the dr visited her and used costic for her throat with success mr wilkins's man edward went off mrs miss stone came to see us some time since and when we returned the visit miss stone told elizabeth the reason they visited us was they belonged to the way side hospital and a german of the 1st infantry came up here on furlough for recruiting and spoke so much of lewis's kindness to the men he said he bought a wagon load of chickens and gave them to the sick soldiers and when he went to town to purchase medicine he paid for it himself if he had not money enough allowed lewis has now changed to fergusons light battery and i think he finds it rather dull these way side hospitals are very great charities the ladies of this place hire a large room place beds in it as many as the space will allow and 2 ladies have charge each week send every day to the rail road and provide 3 meals this war has brought out all over the land beautiful instances of true charity blessing and being blessed 24th october papa has determined to go to his plantation early in november and i am quite reconciled to his going because he always moves at this season and because it is now difficult to get what he likes to eat if he cannot remain on his place he will return to us we will have to remain up here i suppose all winter the difficulty of getting supplies increases and now we shall be without butter and soon i suppose the cow will go dry we have a number of servants to feed and there seems a prospect of not getting corn we wrote for rice but it has not been sent as there is none in town mr grimball has given 50 to the hospital in richmond 100 to the relief of those who suffered by the fire in charleston and all subscriptions brought to the house are responded to 5 or 4 or 3 to the supplying clothes for the soldiers or a hospital we have no income and are in a fair way of getting to the end of what we have in this state of things he earnestly desires to subscribe to the free market to other demands upon the liberality of the public but i tell him he has first to consider his own family the papers have been filled with heart rending accounts of the needs of our soldiers in the field their shoeless and bleeding feet their rags the cold nights no blankets since the war began the efforts of private charity have been directed to the soldiers and we hear that in their rapid marches they are forced to throw away their clothes blankets c and how can they be supplied the south carolina troops are said to be the most destitute heyward manigault is going to his plantation in that way he avoids military duty his family are to remain in greenville berkley arthur have had second attacks of fever w is trying to get arthur in the signal company john writes from mobile that the naval officers are greatly excited by the new plan of promoting for meritorious conduct and not as in the old way according to rank it is not thought this is rendering justice

november 5th papa went off this morning with his man and his maid and i hope he will get down comfortably and be able to stay on his plantation he went off feeling very sad and with heavy forebodings but the times cause that the poor old gentleman we shall miss him very much all his ridgid ways were sometimes very distressing he disliked harry and i can't wonder at that for he is a most disagreeable child excitable and worrying and without feelings of proper respect for those older a noisy trying child the stately and old time politeness which was kept up between mr grimball papa is not often seen now mr grimball read history to him and he made remarks and the two looked like specimens of long forgotten breeding only to be met in books he heard more books talked of by mr g than he ever heard in his life berkley wilkins came up here to bring his wife to stay with mrs faber her aunt b took down a carpet we sent for the soldiers and 2 blankets 50 arthur has moved to town and sent up for his clothes and as i had no trunk they were put in a bag he was quite in want of a trunk and some more clothes poor child mr grimball went out this morning to try get him some shoes pants 27 november mr grimball returned from camden with the box of silver which we now have up here and has gone to charleston where he intends offering his services for military duty in the reserves captain lesegne he is under 65 the governor and council have called out all men under 65 and of 16 to do military duty i have received 3 letters from him he was when last writing at the bluff on a visit to papa and the abandoned plantation with the 13 old negroes left there our own soldiers are most destructive in their visits to houses left and entered ours and helped themselves to what they liked when this war does end the poor planters on the coast will be found in a miserable plight berkley offered mr grimball his stock to purchase a place to put the negroes on which he declined but it was very kind of b he had just passed through another attack of fever a w are at fort sumter lewis on sulivan's island john writes to ella from mobile that he has some pleasant ladies to visit there and that the navy is held in great repute since admiral buchanan came there which state of things he is enjoying the time the war goes on and we hope in spite of every thing there will soon be a peace at present not a ray of the quarter from which it will spring but the triumph of the democratic party at the north and the little success they have yet arrived at south the removal of mcclellan is too in our favor burnside is represented as a man of military education but urged on by the abolition party at the north may be induced to hazard a battle which we think he will loose the lord is over all and in his hands we are to destroy or to save 28 november the weather cold thankful we are where we can get wood the price here is 2.50 for a cord there is great difficulty in getting change fortunately this morning i got a 20 bill changed by purchasing 4 worth of meal two poor women recently came here to beg i was not able to give them meal for i find it hard to get it for my own family and had no change but this morning when i was in the village i passed one of them gave her 25 having felt badly at refusing her all aid when she applyed to me at the door john has been made first lieutenant which pleases him very much no more pay but a better position elizabeth goes to dine with her aunt every saturday to spend the day with eliza who is very much out of health miss clemy legg sent a message to elizabeth requesting her to come and see her yesterday afternoon gabriella herself went to return miss butler's visit her mother teaches at the district school was a miss stone is a widow and then went to see miss legg mrs legg told the wilkinses that her daughter found elizabeth perfectly charming and enjoyed the saturdays when they practised for sunday e leads the choir she really sings very well indeed she has improved herself wonderfully

12th april things seem at last to have reached the war point the 17th regiment has been ordered down to morris's island and the northern government have sent to inform the southern that they intend to reinforce the forts and collect the revenue a fleet is expected off the harbour and every thing is in a state of preparation 4 of the boys are on duty berkley in the sumpter guards and arthur william in the cadet riflemen lewis wants to volunteer in the sumpters i think he ought not john is now on constant duty and seems actively engaged he wrote to us yesterday that he had been in town for anchors and found the house deserted only adam covered with white wash he said he was alive but he could not say kicking for he could hardly move one leg before the other he was so tired mr grimball went down to see about the boys and found them all gone he will return on saturday and then we shall hear all yesterday i was in a most terrible state of anxiety and misery about my boys but i know my case is not different from others mrs elliott the mother of william's captain has her only child down there mrs lowndes her only son many others but mine are very fine boys and very dear to me still they must do their duty to their state and i put my trust in my god their god my savior their savior and i pray for them for myself the government at washington seem full of duplicity and in looking back to the conduct of the seceding states there seems to have been a truthful and noble faith actuating them fortunately before things came to the war the interest was paid on the money at the north and i have mine now in charleston six hundred and ninety seven dollars i am very glad of this for it will help us through the summer mrs bulow mrs gammage have left charlotte they were sent for went to papa's this morning he had been to mr barnwell to hear the news mr b wrote to his wife that yesterday at 1 o'clock gen boregeard demanded the surrender of the fort from anderson he replyed he could not with honor and this morning at 5 o'clock the war began we have not heard the guns the news is that the harriet lane u s s is out side with troops and supplys 14th april lewis went down yesterday afternoon and returned today by an express train he brings us news that fort sumpter is given up after a gallant defence when major anderson evacuated it he requested to be allowed to salute his flag and gen boregard said that he had defended his command so bravely that he should be permitted to do so he wrote to his wife a letter which was sent to gen b to forward he had to open it and it was said to contain these words among others my government have shamefully abandoned me and i shall now fight and die like a man there were none killed on either side the fort has been destroyed inside officer's quarters burnt the men looked thin smoked up with the shells which were most of them sent by stephen's battery fort moultry was uninjured 5 men wounded in the evacuated fort how thankful we are not however as much so as we ought to be yesterday after church i stopped to see papa this i always do on sunday and these visits are very pleasant to me he loves us all in his way gives me some oysters which he buys from mr la roche's man who brings them for sale to the church and i hear family news during this excitement and anxiety i do not think charlotte has been very kind in her manners she i have no doubt felt but on such occasions people ought to express themselves to be understood i find her an excellent well principled woman with a disagreeable temper no manners but in this world we must be thankful for the good we find in those who belong to us and not judge them too harshly charlotte has on many occasions been kind to us all and i thank her mr grimball remained in town until tomorrow mrs butler writes to papa that the overseer came to her said he had a letter from mr pierce butler saying he must send a boat to take his to w simon's send eleck she ordered him not to send the boat and that eleck was waiting on her she said she was there in charge of the property would continue so has written to judge law to confirm her action she says her case is a very hard one and she deplores it richard seems to be very ill spits blood coughs and she writes very wofully of him says she certainly will not leave him in georgia he has an overseer and leaves things to him charles also has an overseer and being engaged in fixing guns in fort pulasky and expecting to be in a steamer in coast guard all summer will be able to visit his plantation see about his affairs i don't think richard charles get on very nicely i am sure it must be richard's fault for charles is a very kind good tempered man and richard has always been very self willed passionate harry during the transaction of our business together wrote me a very nice letter he expresses a kind interest in my boys and i love him for it and he hopes still for a reconstruction that may be hoped for but can never never be there have been too many bitter feelings between the two sections and it seems to me it would have been just as reasonable for us to be rearranged as british provinces soon after the revolution broke out as for us to go back to a government with our taunting fanatic northern brothers 15 april this morning we received a very pleasant visit from charlotte she feels but does not know how to express herself mr aiken also came over and paid a very pleasant visit he told us of the early history of general boregard he was a graduate of west point the second honour man he had become very much attached to virginia scott the daughter of gen scott was refused by both parents but accepted by the young lady she wrote to him but his letters were repressed and hers ceased after a time this preyed on her health she went into the catholic convent at george town and there died before her death she sent for gen boregard and saw him he explained to her that he had always written the letters were kept from her she died but 6 months after he married another men have died and worms have eaten them but not for love and now has a second wife in this days paper there is an account of the evacuating of the fort sumpter anderson has gone to the fleet this is the first time the u.s flag has been lowered and now to the palmetoe flag there seems to be a determination on the part of the northern government to war with us when major anderson fired the salute to his flag 5 of his men were wounded 1 of them died immediately the other not expected to live this is very strange i think my state has behaved most entirely according to the dictates of humanity true courage in the treatment of the people in this fort they were fed and beaten honourably dismissed we have done well i this morning read a commendation in the papers the world an abolition journal of the conduct of south carolina throughout this contest since secession the unselfish bravery with which she had conducted herself may god bless and keep us is my prayer and may peace be restored to these states may we each north south governed by those who best understand our rights our wants i mean ourselves be good neighbors help each other on in the road to prosperity on sunday the scene in st philips was very affecting our bishop davis now very feeble and blind was led up to the pulpit and returned thanks to almighty god for his protection his mercies he too had a relative among the troops mrs wayne went down to the city on saturday and the cars being very much crowded late in getting down lewis had to charge himself with the getting these two mrs w her mitchel in a carriage it was 12 o'clock at night before they all got at home lewis found no one but his father at home he seems quite well the war agrees with him 22 april virginia has seceded and all the border states seem to be coming in the movements of the u.s government have been very suicidal every act tells in a way to benefit us there has been a riot in philadelphia in which the black republican spirit was fully exhibited all the accounts tend to shewing a determination at the north to sustain the government and so there is at the south i believe this will give peace arthur was sent up from morris's island to the city to get over an attack of dysentary mr grimball went down to see after him every where there are commotions great and small in charleston taking fort sumpter up here mr elliott said he would hear the children their chatecism and harry although he has been learning his for 6 years did not know it so said mrs barnwell of her two richard ella she said she felt as if she would be humiliated i told mr elliott of harry's deficiancy so last sunday the children went up after a most charming sermon addressed to the parents and said their chatecism very well h had learnt his all the week mr elliott gave them some books which they either are to read keep or return mr elliott is to preach 2 more sundays is to recieve 3 hundred dollars for the 3 month and will come back next winter mr dixson the presbyterian minister has resigned from ill health and gone away yesterday mrs wayne came late spent the evening she took tea went away at 1 2 eleven she gave the history of her mitchel she was married at the age of 16 to a young man named hardenbrook he had a large fortune settled it seems on his children they were divorced and she took her maiden name the children are given to the father's mother she is allowed to see them 2 little boys 1 4 the other 7 mr hardenbrook this lady says is a very abandoned man i do not think her manners impress favorably mrs wayne gave a very amusing account of her ox little blue cart getting mrs rosalie mitchel's heavy baggage to the cars the ox several times took to the woods swamp this animal is large and harnessed with blinds an old horse fixing mr lewis has hired russell middleton's house on south bay for the summer this mrs l does not like the place is rather too public she is shy not always attentive to her appearance i am glad of her being there for i like her the governess they had early in the winter was a very mischief making woman she wrote notes to mr lewis noticing annie's treatment of julia her step daughter trying to excite him against her spoke in a most disorganizing way to the servants the last visit we paid to mr barnwell ann spoke in great disgust of miss juliet elliott's malicious style of remark she said several things calculated to excite them against charlotte heyward ann her mother said this did not have that effect but disgusted them with juliet poor old woman a bitter spiteful temper is a fearful companion 25 april mr grimball returned and brought up john who is now a midshipman again with the prospect of being made master like the rest of his date as he resigned when his state did 2 weeks before his examination had excellent letters from the officers who were on board the macedonian with him 1 of course from the captain and an unusual honor one signed by the other officers he seems to have through all the stirring events of this winter conducted himself well gov pickens who gave him a lieuts commission always behaved well to him he sent his letters to the secretary of the navy at montgomery and the reply from malory was that owing to all the circumstances of the case it should be presented to the president for consideration and gov pickens endorsed a letter from john to the same effect so the matter stands papa has been arranging a plan for mrs butler to reside for the summer at grass knowl a healthy place belonging to georgia charles having a home there suited to his plantation she wrote that she was very much disgusted with her situation and the annoyance of contending with mr butler who had arrived in darien to take posession as soon as she left we hear that she has gone north so suddenly that she had not time to write if she can live there without any annoyance from owning southern property or rather being supported by it i think she has done best for herself for 34 years ever since her marriage she had enjoyed a degree of affluence and fashion there which must have made her identify herself with the people with the place she is now a very stout old woman these comforts which she has there must be very dear to her she has been much separated from her own family and is accustomed to her luxury her loneliness i hope she may enjoy the former all her days have the other remedied by the society of her daughter grandchildren 24 april charles writes to papa that he has been ill with dysentry he was better and had been so kindly treated by mr nightengale and comodere tatnel he says after this his letters are to be directed to captain morris he is in charge of the warship he had a very fine colt at papa's which in this letter he requested papa to send to him as he wished to present it to mr nightengale the colt died just a few days since and i am sorry for charles loss but i do not think mr n would like to accept such a present as his daughter has refused charles mrs butles had joined a party going north the journey was to be very long round by tenasee the cumberland river ohio river to pitsburg in pennsylvania mr john elliott's father preached for us gave the communion on sunday the son is a better preacher the old gentleman looks stuffy and fading away as we all are the mails are stopped from the north and consequently we are quite at a loss for news the last accounts were very warlike from maryland there had been a meeting between the people of baltamore the troops coming from new york pennsylvania ordered to washington by mr lincoln lewis is trying now to get his company the st paul's rifles to volunteer to go to virginia in the 1 regiment col johnston petigrew commander they don't seem so willing these men as the officers lewis have been going round the parish to try and get the complement of men on saturday they had 12 including officers and they require 45 i don't think they have much chance lewis seems to have been very unsuccessful in his plans up here he tried raising hogs and finding it would not pay has sold out to some man in the pineland who i am sure will never pay him his whole stock for 80

june 25 mr grimball still in town but expected to day he sent me a letter from mary wilcocks about mrs mcallister mrs butler's daughter her health is in such a critical state that it was thought proper to inform her mother she was dreadfully distressed and at once said she would be glad to go on to the north to see her daughter mr grimball will go with her to richmond to get her through if possible this breaks up our pleasant housekeeping but i am very glad we are here and able to have papa with us for he is very feeble and much changed by his troubles and his age mr wilkins is fortunate in getting a small house containing 4 rooms for 15 per month where she will live with her daughters more comfortably and she thinks more reasonably than boarding gabriella and charlotte were confirmed in charleston just before we left there and last sunday it being communion sunday i had the great comfort of having my 3 daughters with me partaking of that sacrament i pray that they may earnestly walk in a christian life the battle near richmond is a glorious victory for us we have met with great losses in the lives of valuable young men but this with the signal repulse on james island are very telling in shortening the war letters from mr grimball from richmond mrs butler still there hoping to get through the rail road had been torn up and if she succeeds in getting through she will have to ride two days in a carriage to fredricksburg we are getting on here well enough i think now we need not have left charleston at all but the change will be of great service to all of us and already has done gabriella a great deal of good william has made another unsuccessful effort to obtain a commission that way to distinction is evidently closed to him and we may just as well reconcile ourselves to it i feel very anxious about john he wrote to his father asking for money and was sent a letter containing 50 which he never received and as he was put to inconvenience by it we are quite annoyed he was at atlanta georgia getting ordinance stores for the gun boat

july 11 mr grimball and papa went into the country to day it has been very warm lewis writes from fairfax c h on the eve of battle for an over coat for a grey flannel jacket for woolen socks and crackers cheese and says it is quite cold where he is at night and when on guard duty he suffers very much his usual covering is 2 blankets papa is going to buncomb with c w engaged a room and sets off on the 20th he has given me a barrel of small rice and 50 to buy something for myself he gave each of the girls e l 30 elizabeth 40 he gave me 50 in change for house keeping mr grimball one hundred bushels of seed rice all this is to help the living he gave lewis money when he went off and a little bible which was very kind the wilkinses have had 2 little teas which as they have a piano went off nicely we have had two the last included mr mrs lewis h manigault and a miss north who sings very well is very fat has red hair she wishes to go to europe and be cultivated for a public singer but cannot get her parents to consent to it they live on ill terms with each other ann barnwell took elizabeth to drive with her yesterday afternoon and poured out her discontent with life herself and all the world to elizabeth e said she had been struck with a remark in a novel of thackery's she had lately read to a good natured man the world is pleasant and kind but to one who is misanthropic the world is very crooked and unhappy so if she would feel more interest in people they would please her and she would be happier we have had a constant succession of afternoon visitors and papa has been rather struck with it in this dreary world where feeling except for self seems no where it is affecting to hear of such love as this papa went the other day to see mr alfred huger and said he was waiting to go to buncomb with his daughter charlotte he looked at him and his face all alive with feeling said morris is she any thing like the one she was called after he assured him his daughter was altogether lovely and of good report to which mr huger replyed i have never for one hour had her out of my mind the pressure of her hand when she parted with me i still feel and i would to day old and crippled as i am walk a mile to serve any one i thought it would please her that i should the history of this heart affair is this when mr huger was a young man he addressed my mother's sister charlotte manigault and she loved him but my grandmother could not reconcile herself to another of her daughters being as she said sacrificed at the south so she induced charlotte to refuse him and i think she never got over it her younger sister harriet married and she attended the death beds of 2 sisters and died herself a victim to consumption so in fact my grandmother sacrificed her to the north i have always felt as if i had been unjustly deprived of a very charming aunt for i knew her loved her and mr huger who really loved her loves her still married a woman older than himself a poor little dreary soul who had nursed a sister of this gentleman in a lingering illness in which the two were brought much in contact and sympathy and so a match of propinquity took place no children but now in his old age he has in his house the children of a nephew who has lost his wife and with these young people about him and thinking of his lost charlotte life is nearly for him ended i have been quite ill with a pain in my head stomach in the years that have passed of my married life i have when ill dragged round after my duties with weak wretched feelings many times i have knelt down and said family prayers with a faint heart swimming head from weakness now my children are grown i intend to try the other system go to bed when i feel badly and be waited upon and if i live long enough shall end by pursuing the plan i like best for the 12 confinements i had motives of economy induced me to only 4 times have a regular nurse and only twice for a whole month the others i had what i could get at home the regular nurse here was with me 2 weeks i believe now this was a mistake it was thought that i really did not wish a nurse and not that i made a sacrifice to what i considered necessary economy i recollect now the feeling of nervous misery when ill with a baby a head paining the noise of children running up down stairs doors slamming c that restraint which the presence of a stranger in the nurse would have occasioned in my sick room not there the dreary details of expenditure discussed at my bed side well i have had now have many blessings but were i to begin life again at such times i would have a nurse i would nurse myself july 26th papa left us for buncombe on the 24 he went off in a furious annoyance at not being called for before half past eight so he quarreled with the hack man i am glad he has gone for his rigid ways became disagreeable we did as well as we could for him i believe he was satisfied with his visit the grand northern army left washington horse foot and flying artillery regulars volunteers and sang jubilant airs along the road a strategic movement on the part of the southerners brought them on to bull run where the forces were ready to meet them and where there was a dreadful battle loss on both sides and the northern army completely routed all their batteries taken and some thousands mowed down gen bee fell mortally wounded sustaining a desperate assault col johnston fell soon after he reached the battle bauregard was there gen johnston took the colors of a wavering company and led them to the attack jeff davis was on the field and in short it was a glorious victory today there is a grand military funeral for bee johnston gen bartow who also was killed in the fight goes through to savannah may the almighty protect us and make us thankful this battle was fought on sunday charles paid a nice little visit here and looked so well and in such good spirits i was delighted to see him we have not heard from lewis since the battle the ladies are all as busy as possible forming themselves into relief societies for the wounded soldiers and also to prepare clothing for them in the winter which will soon now approach we have some work to do 10 long shirts for sick men papa gave the money for the cloth and charlotte gave 10 mr grimball 5 28 july the accounts from the battle continue to come in and the

5 august mrs stevens wrote me a note yesterday morning to say that she had permission from her husband to join him at vicksburg and she would be glad to take letters or a parcel for john so we all wrote letters made them in a packet and gave them to her for she came in the afternoon to see us this morning she went off on her long journey to reach her husband i hope she will get there safe and find them well i showed her the ambrotypes of my 5 eldest sons introduced her to john we were all very much delighted a few days since by getting a letter from william announcing his change to fort sumpter he had received a commission from richmond as 2nd lieutenant in the calhoun's artillery we had given up all expectation of w's getting any thing and i am very glad for us all and particularly for his sake there had been so many applications for him and all had so entirely failed the last was in the sharp shooters his name was put down by gen evens but the major's bing smith was one made interest to have his name taken off and a friend of their own put in the place this was a very disagreeable thing and we all felt worried by it but now if his health is good in our climate there is always a terrible risk in a change and fever seems to lurk in every place i feel very anxious about him john we sent down his trunk and as in this out of the way place there is no express adam was sent to columbia to put the trunk and a parcel containing the sheets and the key of the trunk in the express it cost 5 50 the whole thing 19 august we have received a long letter from john giving an account of the 3 engagements in which he was in the arkansas they were most brilliant and the vessel did wonderfully for the machinery evidently was not of sufficient force to make the vessel effective the majestic way in which she moved was as fast as she could go the end of this was naturally the destruction of the vessel we are now most anxious to hear from john he sent us a drawing of the vessel and which he wishes photographed and we saw by the papers that the last engagement of the poor arkansas ended in her being blown up by her own crew they all escaped to the shore mr mrs vanderhorst are up here for change of air they remained a few days in the village spent an evening with us were at the palmetoe house and then to the cherokee springs arnoldus vanderhorst has had a duel with alfred rhett neither of them hurt the bench of honor managing the affair 23 august on tuesday 19 august after tea john came to us having a furlough to get his clothes he traveled a long way and it was a great comfort to see him but he only remained with us 2 days he has gone through many perils and is unhurt but he returns to the battery where he is stationed at vicksburg and is very much exposed to the climate i felt dreadfully at parting with him but these are times of such miserable anxiety and there are such family losses that we have a sort of stunned and bewildered feeling as if we were all struggling on some dusty tiresome road and had at long intervals a pleasant meeting and then our friends passed on more quickly and we lost sight of them the war seems to be as far from its end as ever and what is to become of us should it continue mr mrs vanderhorst stopped here on their way to the rail road arnoldus was with them he is an unmannerly young man and just now looks miserably having been sick in virginia about 3 weeks since heyward manigault paid us a visit of a week occupying mrs butler's room next to papa's he was very quiet and seemed pleased charlotte has written to elizabeth from greenville where they are passing the summer that he was very much pleased with his visit and found us very comfortably fixed he is thinking of establishing himself in greenville moving his negroes and selling out at wiltown mr lewis has come up to look for a place to move his negroes to fix his family heyward was very kind in getting me some chimneys for the lamp we burn in greenville sending them by the stage they fit very nicely got here quite safe mr grimball has bought for william and for arthur pants up here of domestic cloth very good sent them down john took for mrs stevens a large bundle for her son such a one as i should not like to impose upon any one for it took up so much room in his trunk and he was not able to put in his blanket and hope he did not thereby lose it miss becky carson came to see ella lotty asked the 3 girls to tea they went and found it very pleasant miss legg called to see them mrs davidson visited us mrs mcbeth and we have seen something of abbe smith these last are refugees like ourselves william wharing mikell came up here to see their mother wh's wife they paid us a visit and told us about the boys lewis's col dunavent is court marshaled for drunkeness and is in town to be tried l thinks of joining ferguson's company of artillery to go to tennessee william they had seen he lives at the fort very comfortably by their account lee keeps a table d'hote at the fort and they all eat with him paying 15 per month ripley became so morose when he got to virginia that his aids generally resigned we have not heard from john but orders have reached here for him to join the baltic in mobile i am always anxious about him august has passed and here is september with no great change in our affairs we have no reason to be very much discontented just now we have many comforts and are well but the anxiety about absent exposed members of the family continues all the time william does not write in a way to make one feel happy he seems disappointed and that is not pleasant arthur got his pantaloons which were sent to him berkley writes in a quiet resigned spirit which is rather soothing and lewis in an affectionate way about his brothers which we all like arthur in good spirits about what surrounds him

september 2 elizabeth devotes all her mornings to teaching lotty harry and in so doing tires herself very much and in the case of harry is conferring a benefit most thankfully received i know no one so cultivated and elegant in her manners as elizabeth or accomplished she has a disciplined and highly improved mind and is the help to her parents her brothers sisters and the adorning attraction to the family circle gabriella is trying earnestly to cultivate herself and i am afraid labours too hard to attain her object she is graceful and elegant looking posesses a natural cleverness of expression very admirable but her morbid feelings are the cause of much unhappiness to herself lotty will be very handsome when she is fully developed and through e's care she will be a cultured elegant young woman harry is naturally clever but is not steady enough to do very hopefully ann smith mrs eddings came to see us yesterday afternoon juliett eddings miss atkinson from the other wing came in to tell us good bye she is going to pass some time with her sister mrs dozier the wife of lieutenant d who has a house in charleston september 5 there are great successes to our arms in virginia and i fear great losses mrs irwin our landlady came in after tea to tell us of it a very kind hospitable woman quite a register of family events in the society which surrounds her but although she narrates well and accurately and takes one through the lives of those she talks of from the cradle to the tomb the perfect ignorance about these people except from what she says makes one take no sort of interest in them it is just simply life death dr whiteford smith who is the president of the colledge up here paid us a visit yesterday morning and made me feel pleasantly all day a clever good genial man his only son is now with the army and he told us they had felt anxious to get warm clothes for him and his wife a great contriver had taken the checked flannel out of a large cloak of his and made some shirts for him he bought a thick great coat and intended going to virginia to see his son and give him these warm clothes the young man is just 18 and said he wished to take his share in this struggle and not have it said to him when the independance was achieved that he was enjoying what he had not worked for dr smith thinks the war will be a great benefit to the country enlargement of mind to very ignorant contracted country people the families of soldiers now take news papers and if they can't read themselves they get people to read to them and some of them have learned to read themselves one woman in his neighborhood whose husband a hard working man and gone off to the wars had learnt to write read writing since her husband left her and he had too learned to read write that he might write to her she could read his letters but no other writing dr s talked in the most charming way of bulwer's novels he prefers the caxtons my novel to all his other books and ducroux does not like dickens thinks his caracters distorted and exagerated which spoils all the beauties thackery he has not read having begun his lectures with the yellow plush papers and could only get through 2 pages i wish he would come again the weather now is very charming heard from john he had not yet got his orders was at mobile when he wrote we walk every afternoon and get on very comfortably september 7th news was brought yesterday that we had again gained a great victory at the old battle ground manassas and among those slain were dr smith's only son and several other young men graduates of this college excellent moral characters what a loss to their families and how these parents are bowed with trouble miss clem legg sister of the young ladies who called on elizabeth was engaged to mr palmer a very fine young man one of the killed and her sister mary was in the train of an engagement with mr capers also slain and said to be a most charming person mrs walker who keeps a hotel here went to richmond after the first of the battles in that neighborhood to bring home her son's body said to be killed she found him severely wounded and brought him home he is now well except a stifened arm she says she shall all her life consider this step against the advice of her friends an especial providence she visited one of the hospitals near richmond which contained 4 thousand patients said no one who did not witness the sufferings there could realize the horrors of the war a lady of richmond daily accompanied by two servants brought and administered herself a quantity of fine nutritious chicken soup one young man had an old negro man who sat by him fanned off the flies she stopped and told him she hoped he would get well he shook his head and said no he could not he was too badly wounded the servant remained with him until he died and then after preparing his body for the grave bundled up his things put them on his head and went off home the grave yard where the military burial takes place has two in each grave numbered marked so that they can be identified she saw the yankee major biddle there he died of his wounds and had the most vindictive feelings to the last said it was a horrid war and would never end there has been so much counterfeiting of confederate bank bills that all the 20 50 100 bills have to be called in of the issue of 2 september 61 mr grimball has to go down to charleston to change those that he has he goes on tuesday not feeling very well we heard from mrs butler her grandchildren have been sent to california to their father and she says she is perfectly crushed and miserable poor dear soul how dreary life will be to her she perfectly idolized her daughter papa called me down stayrs this morning to tell me about his affairs he has some money or confederate bonds in the bank of charleston and up here in the hands of mr judd 709 70 in his press the bill the money to pay the corn for mr kirkland his will papers are in the hands of mr robertson we hear from mrs irwin and others of the distress of miss legg she seems broken hearted she has been engaged 3 years to mr palmer he is from the low country was handsome well born rich and cultivated the 3 young men whiteford smith capers palmer were in the spartan rifles and shot by one ball found lying close together it would have been a comfort to this poor girl if she had been married to her love and then she could have mourned with his family and had a claim on their sympathy the success of our arms continues we hope that this may lead on to peace 17 september martin came up and paid a short visit to his mother looks as usual berkley writes to me the company has been so much reduced by detatchments that they have quite hard duty a few evenings before he wrote 3 negroes henry lowndes servant lucas's servant and one of the teamsters had gone off to the yankees which made them feel a little uneasy about their exposed situation a night attack from the gun boats might annoy them very much mr grimball returned from the city having purchased some candles 1.25 per lb horrid looking yellow bad smelling things brought me some yeast from the bakers and i have commenced baking rolls for breakfast papa got so very much bothered about the corn fearing he might be made to pay more than his share that i concluded it best to pay up at once for all that i was to use 1.37 per bushel although he bought some at 1.10 and the rest at 1.25 and paid 4 for the carting i paid for two bushels already settled for and now we are free from accounts together and he seems better satisfied some weeks ago i changed 4 lbs brown sugar for him for 4 lbs best white and he could not rest until it was weighed before his eyes which was done my papa has a very mean mind and is an extremely close man he wonders at my buying peaches for the children and thinks it a great expense he cannot eat them he really lives here in the most comfortable way at the smallest expense he talks now of going down to the low country as soon as possible to see after his business and yesterday offered me the use of 3 rooms in his house i would rather charlotte should take charge of him in winter and hope i may not be obliged to live in his house now i have no home for our plantation is broken up our house in town is only a hired one upon the whole i may consider myself at home any where my family trunks c are mr irwin paid us a visit yesterday told us mrs kenedy's family were very anxious about clem legg it seems there is a case of derangement in her family a daughter who lives with them and is quite out of her right senses it came about unexpectedly and there is a risk of this young ladys being equally afflicted she takes her trouble in such a silent stunned way mr grimball transacted his business very successfully he saw william lewis this last moved from church flatts to sulivans island dr lining met mr g in the street and spoke very well of lewis practise which i think was very kind as drs do not like to praise one another he said lewis has lost very few cases william was not very well there had been a duel from the fort alfred rhett killed ransom calhoun a man he particularly hated and as the thing was not represented to the military authorities there had as yet been no notice of it taken 19 september yesterday was set apart by the government as a day of thanksgiving for our victories we went to the methodist church and heard a fair sermon by mr stacy and a very fine prayer from whiteford smith there was a collection taken up for the wounded soldiers i put in 4 gov wilkins passed through here yesterday and came to see us in the evening he has been on a visit to his family in greenville and looks badly he was on his way down stopped to see his mother gov travelled here in stage from greenville with an old lady in black she said she had lost her only son in one of the battles and her daughter being very much attached to her brother died soon after him her son in law was in service and she did not feel much interest in the war she had lost both her children and they could not be restored the family distress is dreadful 30th september there has not been a rising in maryland as was expected and as far as rumor gives us information we have not gone on so gloriously as was expected but only by hard fought battles kept our ground against our treacherous foe miss juliet elliott invited elizabeth to pass a day with her and take a ride to glenns springs she went yesterday i am glad of a little diversion for her she has such hard work teaching harry mr irwin who is a perfect chronicle of parish events came to see us the other evening and told us that mrs wilson had left mrs tompson's with a half month unpaid 47 that she talked very freely about people would lead those she spoke to into the belief no one was of any account except her family the gibbes i liked her very well her manners are easy but she comes of a family not considered truthful and on that account not much regarded dr boyds wife a miss tompson mrs i says drank and was subject to fits brought on by the use of stimulants he had a life of it with her she died young and left 7 children inheritors of her habit for i believe intemperance is inherited just as much as gout or scrofulous consumption we got our shoes from the mute rogers paid 4 25 for each 1 pair for ella lotty 1 pair for myself they look like strong well made shoes i have ordered a pair for harry to be done in six weeks this seems to be a district of a low character in morals i do not hear of any one being more correct than another mrs i says mrs legg who was a miss kenedy married a man much beneath her in family and it came about in this way the

sep 3 received letters from lewis near atlanta in the trenches he was overwhelmed with distress at the death of his brother says he has been confirmed joined the church bishop ley is with the army lewis has for some time been seriously impressed then wavered before he joined the church this war has had a very chastening influence on the young men and his brothers death no doubt assisted the feeling i am truly thankful for the mercy sep 2d my mind is constantly dwelling on william's life his earnest serious manner when a very little child we were all riding together the other boys made so much noise that w knelt down and said his prayers which surprised them so much they became quiet one day he said to me ma don't die for if you die i will die too then if you die i will go to heaven to look for you he said his chatechism when he was going to college to keep arthur quiet when quite grown up he put harry to bed for two months as h wished it miss smith said he had the most reverent manner in church i cannot think that with such a nature religion being long felt a comfort as he wrote to me was lightly understood he must have taken it lovingly into his soul mr grimball often says he thinks he was not treated judiciously in that way met his death but i try to think it was god's will to take him from us this passing world when his papers came up there was a letter from william to his father the last he wrote saying that might be the last of him if it was not for the expense he wished him to come then said come come it almost broke mr grimball's heart but he could not have got there sooner than he did then he just recognized him oh my dear dear child how i think of you and all your unselfish thoughtful ways i believe i was always kind to him i know i meant to be
lynhurst jan'y 6th 1862 we are having delightful weather now we had a hard rain friday night and another saturday but sunday it cleared off cool and pleasant last week miss mary and i planted some jasmine vines up at the place they seem to be growing well we look forward with pleasure to the spring when our labour will be rewarded by their fragrant yellow blossoms the house progresses slowly it is now nearly all raised and begins to look something like a house father has two negro carpenters to help mr axley friday night i had a most pleasant surprise father came home and said that eldridge had a paper box on the waggon marked for me of course we were all very curious to know who it could be from and what could be in it uncle jim was sent up to mr axley's to wait till the waggon came and soon returned with it when it was opened there lay a very pretty chair made of velvet ornamented with ribbon and straw and the seat of which being raised showed a space nicely lined with flannel it was a fancy jewelry box from miss valeria she had it made for a christmas present and thought it might reach me by christmas eve the taste and beauty of the chair would alone have rendered it acceptable even had it not been a souvenir of affection from one whose affection i prize so highly and made too by her own hands father left for new orleans yesterday we expect him back saturday night saturday jan 11th 62 miss mary lory and i have been very busy this week up at the place we have been clearing out a path from the house to the hill back of it where we design making a little jasmine arbour we worked all day wednesday and thursday and yesterday afternoon clearing away brush digging up little stumps and planting violets we are going to try and plant the jasmine vines today mother received a letter from mrs dwight the last teacher we wrote to accepting the situation and saying that she would leave new orleans on tuesday she must have arrived at monroe last night mother has sent in to see if she is there it is with mingled feelings that i see the teachers nearer approach the predominant one is a desire to begin hard study but then i cannot but remember how long i have lived a desultory life it is almost two years since i have been under the direction of a teacher i know that it will be exceedingly difficult for me to settle into the regular life of school i am aware that during these last two years i have seen clearly my faults of temper and i hope that some have been corrected and their plate supplied by more desirable characteristics but amid the few flowers rank weeds have begun to sprout and it requires a daily exertion of self control to subdue that impatience of reproof or contradiction which i fear i can never wholly eradicate wednesday jan 15th 61 at length i am able to write the teacher has come and more than this i can say that i like her very much she came saturday night with father and monday she commenced teaching but we have not yet settled into the regular routine of school as our books have not come and other things have prevented our being regular miss mary and i are studying french together and mrs dwight says we do very well mrs dwight is fully competent to teach french for she was born in france and remained there studying under the best masters until she was twenty one years old she has been teaching more than ten years she is forty five years of age has been married twice and her second husband is still living she has a daughter a young lady who has also taught mrs dwight is very tall but well proportioned with dark skin dark eyes and black hair she speaks english perfectly correctly but with a slight accent which at first makes her voice seem rather affected she is very lady like very cheerful and has a good education built upon the solid foundation of good sense and real literary taste besides french i study ancient geography mythology rhetoric astronomy and am to take philosophy physiology and arithmetic when the books come sunday was a very warm day but at night it became very cold all day monday it was cold and gray snowed some about dusk tuesday colder and still gray but this morning about eleven o'clock the sun shone out and it has been getting warmer all day monday morning we came in here for school but it was so cold and the change was so sudden that poor miss mary took a chill it was slight however and went off so that she could say her french lesson in the evening but this morning she had another one before breakfast it continued for nearly two hours and she has been in bed all day she is quite weak we have had a visitor nearly every day this week sunday mr pierce as usual spent the day with us monday mrs mason and miss puss bry spent an hour or two with us in the morning mrs mason brought me a basket of beautiful japonicas and hyacinths with some geranium leaves and periwinkles the flowers are still quite fresh this morning major bry came in and dined with us before we had finished dinner mrs craig and miss pamela collins came in miss pamela brought some money which she had had subscribed for the society i received a letter from aunt mary tonight they hope to start from georgia by the twentytieth of this month i do hope they will be able to come willie has his hands at work clearing up the yard up at the place i have not been up there since sunday i have been so busy studying that i have not had time i should not have been able to write so long a journal this time had it not been that i am sitting in the room with miss mary tonight and have thus a very good opportunity of writing saturday jan'y 25th 1862 just two weeks since mrs dwight came the time has been in studying hard all day except a short time for a walk i feel happy now it seems as if i was doing right miss mary is quite well again is taking medicine though to prevent any more chills we expect uncle david and family tonight they were in jackson yesterday father has gone in with the carriage i am full of pleasurable anticipations weather delightful cool but not freezing the roads are good too and it is saturday night just the right time for company to come i have had time to get all my things in order miss phillips and carrie young spent an hour or two with us this morning
thursday january 1st 1863 the old year is past and today a new one commences i feel inclined to look back tonight upon the past year gone now with all its duties neglected or performed all it's faults and all it's virtues and trials overcome thank god i can believe that i have progressed some during the past year personally i have much cause to be thankful last year i hoped that another new year's sun would rise upon a nation once more in peace how different is the truth we hear today that the yankees have attacked vicksburg both by sea and by land but been repulsed three times times with great loss vicksburg will stand it seems impossible for her to fall the yankees have attempted to land on the yazoo but were repulsed war is on every side we hear heartrending accounts from the places where the yankees have been it would require volumes to record the atrocities of butler alone miss mary compton called here this morning this evening mother miss mary eva and i went over to mrs dawson's heard some beautiful singing tram the young ladies willie has been away all day for pork returned with a load tonight and is now busy in cutting it up january 3rd we were all very much surprised yesterday by mr dwight's arrival for although we have been expecting him so long he had so often failed to come that we began to think of him as a thing of the past mother went in to trenton yesterday to see poor mrs bry mrs cauthorn died the day before new years after a long and painful illness it appears that we were misinformed about the conduct of our men in the swamp and that they were surrounded by a greatly superior force and made their escape in a masterly manner it rained all night and is now raining my room floor is quite wet from a leak it seems almost impossible to stop it willie came home last night in the rain but no bad consequences ensued from it wednesday jan'y 7th yesterday evening we were surprised by a visit from young robert smith he has changed very much since he was here last year looks pale and sad poor fellow he returned home the morning of the day in which his father died he did not know of his sickness he has been in eleven battles in nine of which he was actively engaged at last he was wounded in the hand in august and came home last month on furlough his wound has just healed and left his hand a little stiff he has had the neumonia since he came home said he would have called to see us when he went on but was so anxious to get home that he could not stop we hear that butler has been arrested on a charge of defalcation to the amount of six millions we are certain that he has been superseded by banks who has revoked all the late brutish orders of butler and invited the citizens to return to their homes i hope none will return i am more afraid of the kindness of the yankees than of their unkindness we hear also that seward has resigned father has not come yet how i long for his coming jan'y 9th mr smith left thursday morning we have not heard from father yet the weather is cold and damp dr temple has bought mrs dwight's place and moved into it mrs dwight asked mother with tears in her eyes to let her remain here for a month and teach us french and music for her board of course mother could not say no though she would have preferred a different arrangement i spent the day at mrs dawson's wednesday it passed away very quickly and pleasantly monday jan'y 12th we received a letter from father yesterday oh how glad we were he wrote on the 21st of dec says he cannot possibly get home before the middle of this month it is almost here now we may begin to expect him about the last of this week we went to church yesterday evening for the first time in many months heard mr goodwin the new minister preach i was not much pleased with his sermon but as usual found something in it to arouse my conscience willie took miss dawson in his buggy or rather in mr dwight's which he borrowed carrie young julia compton miss mary compton and miss newcomb and miss bennett were at church miss newcomb and her sister are at mrs young's now wednesday jan'y 14th monday willie and i went about eighteen miles from here into the country across the schuder as every one says it is there that willie has been buying his pork we went in the buggy and were riding from nine o'clock until after dark only stopping about two hours and a half the face of the country is much the same as it in here but much more thinly settled we saw five or six very good houses took dinner at the house of old mr reynolds a fine old man from georgia mrs seale mrs morris and miss scott spent the day here monday i was sorry i was not at home to see them miss newcomb and sister also called to see me in the afternoon i went over to see them yesterday afternoon but they had gone to mrs compton's willie went off for pork again yesterday after dinner has not returned yet last night a wounded soldier from minden stopped was very well acquainted with young smith thursday jan'y 15th this morning when we rose little jim who came to make our fire this morning said miss sarah it's snowing i looked out of the window and sure enough there was the white fleecy snow falling in large flakes it had just commenced we could hardly dress for looking at it none of us had ever seen it in day time before and we were perfectly delighted with the beautiful sight it snowed quite steadily for about an hour but the ground was very wet from yesterday's and last night rain and was not whitened except in spots after breakfast the children had a fine snowballing it has been snowing sleeting and raining at intervals all day and is now dreadfully cold ice has been forming all day it was a beautiful sight just after dinner the sun broke out from as clouds around him making the snow shine on every twig and branch and every pine tree while all around the horizon the sky wore a dull cold leaden hues that i have never seen before such a peculiarly snowy and cold sky we have had few gleams of sunshine today but as i write the western waves of ebbing day throw their golden light upon my page giving promise of a sunshiny day tomorrow poor little john has a dreadful cold last night he was very sick and mother was afraid he would have the neumonia but he is much better now though still quite sick with his cold mother has kept him in her room by the fire all day i have just finished answering a letter from mrs yorke mr smith's sister in relation to some pork which she wished to sell to willie today is the fifteenth i wonder if father will come tonight friday jan'y 16th oh what weather cold as zero last night it snowed again but this morning it is too cold to snow everything is frozen the water in pitchers and basins and vases and all my poor flowers my poor little valeria is frozen stiff i have been pouring cold water on it which iced on the leaves now i have it close to the fire i am afraid it is gone i would not have given it for all my other flowers the sky is blue this morning and the sun shines brightly on the white and frozen landscape icicles hang from the houses and every little twig whitened with snow stands out still and distinct against the bright sky i must stop writing for although i am as close the fire as i can get my fingers ache with the cold i don't think i ever saw such weather before the thermometer is at 22 tuesday jan'y 20th the cold weather is gone now but it has left irreparable ravages my poor geranium and the heliotropes look quite dead though i hope they will put forth fresh leaves in the spring miss newcomb and her sister have returned home without paying me the visit they promised they only called here for a few minutes saturday i was at mrs dawson's but came home before they left i was quite hurt at their not coming to see me but i am afraid i have been again mistaken in my estimate of character i received a long and affectionate letter from miss valeria saturday that is worth a dozen visits from anyone else sunday willie and mr dwight took their buggies and went into trenton for miss lucy seale and miss amelia scott they came out intending to spend a week with me but were obliged to return as mrs scott's wagons arrived sunday and she wished to go to her place beyond vernon they spent the night with me and did not return home until yesterday afternoon yesterday we sent over for miss fannie and miss nannie to come and spend the day with us we enjoyed the day very much though the weather was very disagreeable misty cold and rainy it cleared up though after dinner and the sun set clear but this morning it is cloudy again we heard yesterday that hindman had been taken together with four thousand men i hope it is not true friday jan'y 23rd i went in to see mrs seale yesterday found her and lucy at home and spent a very pleasant day i am afraid i cannot say as much for loring who drove me in there damaged text and he looked very dull mrs damaged text rest of page cut off wednesday jan'y 28th miss mary and i spent the day at mrs dawson's yesterday when i first went i intended only to stay a few minutes in fact i went to get some palmetto and to hear miss fannie sing la marseillaise but mr amos came in before we had been there long and as he said he should only remain a few minutes i thought i would remain till he left then it was near dinner and mrs dawson pressed us to stay the day passes so quickly in music conversation and books that i could scarcely believe it when i heard five o'clock strike miss mary had a dreadful toothache last night i thought she would not have any rest but she went to sleep and awoke this morning quite free from pain it is quite cold again we had ice this morning not in our room however we heard yesterday that six of the western states had sent delegates to richmond asking admittance to the confederacy i don't know how true it is i am glad to see them leave the north but i had rather not have them with us
friday jan 1st 1864 oh what a cold new years day everything was frozen this morning and is still frozen the thermometer this morning stood at only eight deg above zero i think it was colder this morning than i ever felt it before i was busy thawing all the necessaries for washing about half an hour after i arose and it took us so long to warm and dress that it was nine o'clock when we eat breakfast a pretty beginning of the year but it was so cold and wonderful to tell the old clock was so cold it could hardly strike it was amusing to hear it labouring out the strokes at first we thought it had stopped but after an interval of at least a minute it struck again and so continued through the whole nine but i was so sorry in going into the parlour after breakfast to find mother's pretty chaste little parian marble pitcher broken i use it to put violets in and day before yesterday i gathered a large and beautiful bunch and filled it with them last night the water froze into a solid mass and split the pitcher into three pieces all held together by the ice the same happened to my little vase only it was worse broken i am so sorry about mother's pitcher it was a gift from aunt mary and she prized it highly and it was all owing to my carelessness in not thinking to pour out the water we took the ice shaped like the pitcher and put it on a saucer on the what not and although there has been a large fire in the parlour since early this morning it has not even softened the ink i am writing with has just been thawed out but i must stop writing and go to bed i am afraid i shall take cold sitting up in my dressing gown monday jan 4th 1864 my real new year commenced this morning not very auspiciously either we did not get along quite smoothly in school i am in hopes we shall do better tomorrow i commenced learning john his letters this morning the dear little fellow was so good and so funny that he set us all to laughing saturday it was so cold we could hardly do anything but keep warm the thermometer stood at sixteen in the morning but rose to 32 in the evening but sunday was so rainy and cloudy that it was more disagreeable than the two cold days willie went down to millhaven saturday returned sunday morning he said when he reached millhaven his feet were frozen to his stirrups he passed over ice strong enough to bear up him and his horse mr craig was here saturday morning said such cold had not been known since 1856 one of the steam pipes of his mill was burst by the frost our poor little plants have fared illy this cold has finished what the last began the cactus is killed down to the roots and so is the wax plant and all the rest oh for spring to awaken life once more to bid our dead plants to revive and infuse new life into us as well as the vegetable world today has been dark and gloomy and the atmosphere is very raw i commenced reviewing my latin lessons today indeed it can hardly be called a review for i have forgotten most of what i learned commenced reading gibbon's rome abridged new year's night we take it instead of the original though it is so much abridged that it hardly resembles it except in the bare facts dr mcdonough spent part of the morning and dined with us yesterday said he was very much exhausted from watching and care had slept very little for three or four nights they have an insufficient supply of bed clothing at the hospital and he was obliged to keep up large fires all night and even then they suffered from cold during those intensely cold nights they had used seven large wagon loads of wood since the tuesday after christmas but this will appear probable when one knows that they keep up six fires day and night i am sorry for poor dr mcdonough he is of a very sensitive temperament and the sight of so much suffering must be very painful to him there was a most horrid murder perpetrated in monroe the other day mr baker's little son only seven years old was riding through town attended by a negro boy when he was shot through the head and instantly killed by a mexican in the texas regiment the man was delivered over to the civil authorities and his trial is to take place today from what we can hear he assigns no motive for this atrocious murder dr mcdonough says he heard that the mexican said he had sworn to kill the first child or woman he met but this seems to me not worthy of consideration as a motive for he must have met women and children before when he had been in monroe several days the little boy belongs to an afflicted family his mother and a brother died very suddenly last summer and now the only remaining son is taken by such a dreadful death the shock almost killed his grand mother his father was absent at the time wednesday jan 6th the cold weather still continues we have not had such a long bad spell of weather this winter this has been the pleasantest day but that is not by any means pleasant for this morning the thermometer stood at 20 and i don't think it is much if any warmer now it has been freezing all day in my dressing room yesterday was a dreadful day as for weather i mean cold and dark and even a little snowy in the morning though but few flakes fell i felt quite happy though for we had such a pleasant morning in the school room not a single fit of bad temper and every lesson perfect i commenced keeping an account of lessons and behaviour and was so glad to be able to give all a perfect mark today it was very well indeed but loring was a little impatient and george quite refractory in his first lesson though very good in his last so i was obliged to give them imperfect marks i was very sorry on lory's account for i think he tried to do well but it is very hard for him to control his temper he did not like it at all but i thought if i did not distribute the marks perfectly justly they would soon lose their value dr dabbs spent the night with us monday he came out quite early in the evening oh such a man as he is so tall and large he is a head taller than father and large in proportion with heavy beard and moustachios now quite iron gray the children looked upon with something like awe i like him quite well though such a dimunitive being as i ought scarcely to venture such familiarity he has recently returned from texas and we were interested in his account of it he says washington co is quite thickly settled with substantial and cultivated people and that it is a very pleasant country his account of san antonio was most interesting to me he describes it as an old irregularly built town with most of the buildings mexican fashion the situation he says is picturesque and beautiful the two rivers take their rise in two springs each more than twenty feet deep and so clear that one can see the bottom there are many similar springs in that part of texas but the water is limestone and not good to drink oh how i should like to go there it must be so beautiful and so strange dr mcdonough spent last evening with us he has an assistant now at the hospital and consequently his labours are somewhat lightened he seemed in very good spirits last night and the evening was quite pleasant there is the supper bell and i must go i have already written more than i intended i hope we shall have a fine day tomorrow the glow of the sunset has not yet faded away in the west but it is so cold my hands are quite numb though i am only a little way from the fire saturday night jan 8th the cold still continues unabated since i wrote last though we have had so many sunshiny days i don't remember such another continuous clear cold in my short experience the other night we were quite surprised by a visit from dr cummings miss mary willie and i were in the parlour miss mary was reading to lory and willie and i were playing how dignified when some one rapped on the door i thought it was eva come to fool us and threw the door wide open with a come in miss eva when i could see in the darkness i discovered dr mcdonough and was still more surprised when he said dr cummings miss sarah and then only i perceived his large figure looking up in the background we had quite a pleasant evening and dr cummings at mother's invitation spent the night with us as they were very much crowded at the hospital we also had a texas soldier to spend the night with us miss mary went to town today to see mrs delary she has concluded not to take any more lessons for the present as the roads and weather are so bad they have a steam ferry at trenton now it is managed by a detail of soldiers miss mary said they were very polite to her and the landing was very good indeed i must hurry and get to bed for it is quite late willie returned from millhaven today i have been busy all day mending and doing other little things among others bound a shoe for miss mary the first i ever did alonzo is making her some out of deer skin which i think will be a very good shape father made the last thursday jan 14th 1864 i hoped this morning that we should at last have a fine day when i rose the sun was not yet up but the blue sky was streaked with beautiful rosy clouds and the golden glow on the horizon showed the ground all whitened with a heavy frost the sun rose brilliantly and the early morning was glorious with bright sunshine and the fresh wind but about 12 o'clock the sky was suddenly overcast and since then we have not seen the sun i was so exhilirated by the bright weather this morning it was so pleasant after the gloomy days we have had until this morning the sun has not shone since sunday there was a sudden thaw and a warm rain sunday night and as the frozen ground beneath would not let it sink in the rain lay on the surface for more than a day our yard looked more like a pig pen than any thing else and is still very wet oh for spring i sigh for it every day if the war lasts another year i shall desire never to see any more wintry weather last winter and this have been so sad to me john and george have both caught very bad colds and george was quite sick yesterday and not well enough to come to school today loring also has a bad cold lory has improved very much since new years has not had but one of his fits of anger though temper has several times been severely tried the other day he was quite provoked about his geography lesson and even threatened to run away but he grew ashamed and could not help smiling when i told him he was behaving just as george had done that very morning and reminded him how silly he had thought george looked john is progressing in his learning is very proud to say his school as he calls it he already knows five letters quite perfectly i hope he will continue to like it as well when he is more advanced in his studies i have commenced giving music lessons to miss may and eva i am afraid i cannot be of much use to them but may at least help to keep up their practice there has been a new conscript law passed calling out all men from sixteen to fifty five at least so it is reported this will take father i don't know what we shall do without either him or willie it would not be so bad if it were not probable that the yankees will be here this winter and i would not so much mind doing without them both if they were on the other side of the river willie is preparing to join his company the tensas cavalry under harrison now and will leave as soon as he is ready he did not get a substitute partly because on thinking it over he thought it not best and partly because he could there was some trouble about the final ratification of the papers and we hear that there are to be no more substitutes those that have them are to have their money restored by government and be called out themselves some rumour is heard of a proposition of peace from the federal government but i am afraid it is only a rumour oh if it were peace honourable peace how rejoiced we should all be miss mary and eva met mr bowmar barr in the road yesterday evening he said his mother and sisters sent their love but had not time to write jenny had been very ill with the measles was just a little better when he left oh how thankful i am that she was spared to her poor afflicted mother mr barr promised to stop when he came back and i shall write by him i must now write longer now else i will have none of the evening left for reading i have not done much towards my months reading yet the days are so short and there is so much to do in them we keep on steadily with our rome it is true read every night except those occassional ones when dr mcdonough comes over we have no other visitor i have just read lamartine's politique rationelle and am as much pleased with it as with the travels there are some things in it that seem like echoes of my own thoughts the sunshine is gleaming through the window and i hope it is the fair promise of a fair day tomorrow monday jan 18th i have not been able to write for several days past my usual time just before supper when it gets too dark to work or read has been otherwise occupied i have been arranging valeria's letters into little books so that i can read them easily i find it some little comfort to read them over and over again though sometimes they contain sentences that sadden me by bringing the past too vividly to my mind i have been busy since friday afternoon sewing a palmetto hat for mrs temple of course i could not work at it this morning as we were in school but i have been busy all this evening and am discouraged tonight at the ill success of my day's work i believe i will take it out and sew it over again yesterday i could hardly sit up i felt so weak and ill and today i have a great soreness in my chest when i cough as i do quite often tired and sick and ill tempered a bad picture indeed it fades however in this quiet room bright with firelight and in the view of the flushed western sky the reflection of the bright sun that has shone all day and which now promises a fine day tomorrow yesterday was dull and rainy and the ground is of course very wet this has kept the three little boys in the house all day and a sad trial it has been to them they have all three dreadful colds loring and george could not go to school friday and were hardly able to do so today i was quite uneasy about loring this morning mother is quite busy making some clothes for willie miss mary is making him a cap father is making a pair of bits for his new horse i am doing nothing but am going to sew some on his clothes as soon as i finish this hat willie has got such a fine spirited horse poor brandon though is gone willie swapped him besides paying eight hundred dollars boot we were so sorry brandon had to go but willie said he could not stand hard service we have named the new horse caesar he is what is usually called cream coloured or clay bank with a white mane and tail is tall and large but beautifully shaped not at all heavy his face and ears have such sensitive spirited expression indeed he is very high mettled his old name was wild bill and he had been led to water for a month past every body was afraid to ride him as he had once thrown and twice severely kicked the same man though this was when the man was intoxicated and treated the horse in a brutish manner willie wants to leave next week but will hardly be ready as the tailor has one suit of clothes still to cut he takes his groom yellow antony with him a sober and quiet man who has attended willie's a horse ever since we started to georgia and who is very anxious to go to the war with him last week col harrison sent here to ask mother to take mrs harrison until he returned from the swamp she is coming on from texas to see her husband has not yet arrived a capt bondurin afterward requested the same favour for his wife but of course we could not take her as we have but one finished room besides willie's which is also the schoolroom tuesday jan 19th i read last night in the diary of mad d'arblay dr johnston says an hour may be tedious but cannot be long this day certainly has not been long but it has been tedious our colds were all so bad that we did not have school miss mary was so ill last night that i was quite anxious about her but she was better this morning and is still improving my cold is very bad though better than hers i have been working on mrs temple's hat all day and it is now finished all except one round which i shall do tonight it is now a very good shape and i am very glad indeed that i ripped it father shod caesar this evening i was of course out to see it the horse is much better than i expected father is very tired tonight no wonder he is not well and has been working hard all day the sun shone out brightly today and i hope the roads will soon be good enough for us to take a ride i have been waiting so long for good weather saturday jan 23rd 1864 it is evening the close of a bright beautiful day we have had delightful weather for some days today it was very pleasant by an open window it has been such a pleasant day to me too but i must go back a little to explain it in my last journal i said that we were all too sick to have school the children continued so for some days thursday morning father asked me to go into monroe with him i was glad to go for i knew it would be a great pleasure and i had no particular work to do and no school to keep me the ride was so delightful more so from the bad weather we have had and from my long confinement in the house the sky looked so blue the air was so fresh and sweet and the birds sang blithely in the clear sunshine i almost expected to smell the jasmine and the honeysuckle and then i enjoyed so much to be riding with father i found mrs stevens and mary both at home and we spent a very pleasant day indeed father came up to dinner in the afternoon mrs stevens said if i would stay all night mary might come out with me the next day with such a promise of course i stayed miss sarah garrett came in with her mother in the afternoon she sang some for us lorena and lorena's reply paul vivian rock me to sleep and all quiet along the potomac tonight were the songs she sang all beautiful i have long known and loved the poem for it is a poem rock me sleep but never heard it sung before after they went away mary and i and little louis took a ride up the river in the carriage it was so pleasant we had a quiet evening at home in the morning we went up to mrs dr mcguire's found her and mrs kenison quite well and enjoyed our hour very much on our return we found mrs lemay and miss eliza baker with mrs stevens miss eliza baker has such a lovely face such a pensive sweet expression that i like to look at her she came to see me and asked me to come to their house when i came in town i certainly shall do so we invited mrs kenison to come out with us and after dinner we bade mrs stevens good bye and drove up for her we went in the parlour to wait until mrs kenison assumed her cloak and hat and there we saw miss snow a young lady who creates quite a stir in the social circles of monroe and who is said to have been the belle of a soirée at mrs sudeling's the other night though to me she seems to have no pretensions towards belleship i can scarcely judge of her attractive qualities however as i only saw her about five minutes it was more than an hour before we landed on this side the river the ferry was so slow but at last we landed safely and met willie on the bank he was riding his new pony a stout serviceable looking grey which he bought for antony to ride we teased him a good dealabout his horse may named it pompey and i think everybody calls it so by this time caesar pompey and antony a distinguished trio indeed this morning the sun rose bright and clear and we congratulated each other on the pleasant morning and the pleasant ride we had in perspective and pleasant it proved to be our horses all went so well mollie did not limp at all and railroad paced like the wind mrs kenison and mary had quite an exciting race coming home but railroad paced far ahead of pompey's gallop i was afraid of hurting mollie's leg and came on behind so i had a full prospect we rode up via mrs phillip's high hill and had a fine view of the valley and the woods it was very pretty though the fields were brown and bare and there was no green except that of the ever bright pine when we came home it was eleven o'clock and we rested and looked at pictures and talked or read until dinner mother was not able to come to dinner she has taken a dreadful cold like the rest of us and it gave her such a head ache that she went to bed before dinner and has not been up since may and mrs kenison went away soon after dinner i was so sorry they could not stay longer we had enjoyed their short visit so much father finished willie's bridle yesterday it is such a nice one and the bits are so bright and pretty willie's last coat came from the tailor's today it is only cut as soon as it is made he will be ready oh how sadly those words sound they make my heart sink within me but this is not the feeling i must cherish wednesday jan 27th we have had no school this week miss mary has been to dr temple every morning eva has been sick and mother indisposed and we have been getting willie ready everything is done now tomorrow he leaves us for camp oh if it were a different service an honourable service he is going to enter upon but to be here inactive in camp with no prospect of usefulness how often i say if we had only got to georgia but i am glad willie did not get a substitute today we were surprised by the sight of a strange carriage driving into the yard and more surprised when we found that the occupant was not mrs harrison but mrs bondurant her husband said he had gone to minden unexpectedly and his wife was so anxious to come down that he thought he would try and get us to take her until he could find a place for her in monroe mother could hardly refuse and so she came in i don't like her much as yet but my opinions so often change that i attach little consequence to first impressions dr mcdonough came over yesterday evening brought his successor at the hospital dr furness dr mcdonough is to go up to mt lebanon with dr powell i shall be sorry for him to go am just beginning to get well acquainted with him and he improves on acquaintance this dr furness is a young man i expect quite pleasant too but cannot form an opinion from one evening when i only saw his face by candle light mrs bondurant spoke of him today said she thought him fine looking he is large and well formed but i thought his face very ugly the fine weather still continues today it is almost as warm as summer i have been setting out some jessamines am so in hopes they will live though i am afraid they are planted too late miss may has been braiding a hat for dr mcdonough and i am now sewing it have it almost finished jan 30th 64 saturday night willie left thursday the 28th as he had intended for the camp but not to stay he was all ready equipped as a cavalry man father had soldered an old canteen and tin cup for him his clothes were finished and ready to put on and mother was making a wallet for antony when capt oliver the quarter master came up to the door he wanted to get father's and the railroad negroes and teams to employ in gathering corn for the government father told him that he could not have them unless willie was in charge of them and capt oliver then made arrangements to detach willie to superintend the gathering of some corn at millhaven this willie thinks will occupy him about a month during which time he will be comfortably lodged and very well fed and above all will be doing something useful and honourable he went to millhaven yesterday morning came back today has made arrangements to commence work on monday mrs bondurant left today has procured a room at mr oliver's old place now occupied by a capt marble a refugee it is nearer the camp and therefore more convenient than this mr haddicks the courier who went home returned yesterday the weather has continued fair and warm till today it commenced to rain this morning and still rains i have been writing letters to aunt mary and grandma today and telling them about our journey has made me think of it more than usual how strange it seems for us to be sitting quietly in this old place after so many and such various plans for moving i also wrote to miss gussie harrison again to try and find out where the ridgills are it seems a very slight ground for hope to find them out but even the slight hope cheers me i think the man by whom john davis sent my other letter fell into the hands of the yankees i am very much afraid none of these letters will reach the destination i am obliged to take the chance of sending them by a chance traveller and do not know even when i shall have this opportunity
1865 january 5th 1865 the clouds have just broken and the setting sun is shining brightly through the clear warm weather continued untill last night when it rained quite heavily and has only stopped since dinner father came home yesterday which delighted us all very much it seemed as if the rain had just waited untill he reached home he has been troubled all day as well as yesterday evening by a pain in his side which mother says is a nervous pain but father says he never was nervous father brought me a letter from miss mary it is sweetly natural and pretty so like her that it seems to me i hear her talking they are not yet settled as mr barr is still at home mrs morancy did not write which was quite a disappointment to me we commenced school again monday and loring and george have been very good loring seems to be really trying to improve but the multiplication table is a hard thing poor fellow john has been up in the school room several times and has learned four letters i have such a sweet white hyacinth on my bureau it is not yet quite fully blown i picked it this morning for fear that the rain and the succeeding cold would spoil it but i do not think it will be very cold tonight i received two letters sunday one from lois and grandma and one from kate stone grandma's was dated oct 31st contains no public news but one short sentence which makes us all very sorry mrs veader is dead we were prepared by a letter capt reynolds received from mrs eastmann for this sad news but alas we are always astonished to hear of the death of a friend saturday night jan 14th i have from day to day put off writing in my journal but as it is saturday night and i have a good deal to write and mother and father being tired have gone to bed though it is only eight o'clock i determined to open my book the present absorbing topic of thought and conversation with us is a letter a long expected long desired letter from willie which was brought this morning by antony who has brought flora up to recruit after some hard service down in the mud willie's letter is written in good spirits he says they are treated with great kindness by the citizens of tensas parish who furnish them with plenty to eat and give them balls and dinners very frequently he has been in to desoto with a flag of truce and their party were allowed to purchase any luxuries they desired or had money for willie says he was in a fight with luke earle's robber band that they were quite defeated and abandoned horses and arms to quite a number one of the party on our side was severely wounded and another had a ball through his coat but willie escaped though he writes that flora was one of the foremost in the charge i am very glad to know that they have plenty i pray that this plenty may not corrupt the morals nor relax the energy of my beloved brother he writes for father to try and procure him some greenbacks there are forty dollars here belonging to willie the only ones any of us have ever had but where to get more i know not willie says he has no clothes with him as he left his saddlebags at oak ridge they only expected to stay four days but have been there a month he says send prince to him until antony can come back but i don't think we can send him as father promised mr gordon he should go with him on some business that he is going to attend to at delhi he is also going to try and buy two mules for father we need them very much indeed for we have nothing to plough or drive except old carry mr gordon came up here sunday afternoon to see father about the tax assessing they expected to start on their round together monday morning but it commenced to rain in the night and continued all the next day so that they could not leave until tuesday morning they were gone until thursday mrs oliver and her two little girls came up to spend the day with us thursday mrs oliver looks very plump and seems well but she is quite too pale to look healthy her older daughter rilla is an intelligent girl and well behaved and little ella is very pretty and has a pretty womanlike air lieut jones came out to see father thursday he has been here several times before but i have been away from home and had never seen him he spent the night here and father went in town with him and mr gordon the next day i like lieut jones very well he seems quite steady and sensible and is more agreeable and well read than one would suppose from his appearance which is at first sight not very prepossessing he is very large and rather ungainly has reddish shock hair and a rough red beard on the lower part of his chin his features are large and massive and the face is ugly except his forehead which is high and fine looking he says that mrs stevens gave a party about a week ago i am surprised i was not invited but there must be some good reason for it so i have not and shall not feel the least hard about until i hear something from may we heard such bad news sunday received a paper full of it oh it was so dreadful at first it seemed to me i could hardly bear my grief and my hatred to the yankees sherman has taken savannah he has marched from north to south through the heart of georgia and boastfully says that he met with no hindrance nor obstacles that his army is better supplied with provisions than when he started and that his wagon train twenty miles long is perfectly safe this in georgia of which i was so proud it seems it cannot be and yet the evidence is too circumstantial to doubt oh the proud boastful invaders may they meet a downfall hardee drew out of savannah with his entire force which was quite small it was right to preserve it yankee news has also been received that hood met a shameful defeat near nashville but father heard yesterday that it was just the contrary oh that it might be i received a letter from eva by mr barr who stayed all night with us a week ago friday on his way to see his wife answered it by nace the next day also sent some things they left miss may enclosed a letter for georgie in eva's he was perfectly delighted with it this gave an impetus to loring's efforts he has been trying hard to write ever since and has succeeded so well that he intends to enclose a letter to eva the next time i write wednesday jan 25th 1865 father went to them yesterday he brought me a letter from willie he is still in tensas we were very glad indeed to hear from him his letters always give me so much pleasure he is perfectly well and faring quite well too but says he is very tired of being without a change of clothes he expected to get some from home before this how unfortunate it is that we could not send prince willie says he has a yankee rifle of the newest patent which shoots eight hundred yards he has also a colt's army pistol mother used often to laugh and tell willie he must not dare to come home without yankee arms she little thought he would really get them so soon though i feel a great deal of sympathy for the hardships willie must endure and anxiety about his welfare yet i cannot help being very much gratified that he is now in a position which i conceive to be the only noble honourable one a young man can now be engaged in that is in active service for his country i am sorry though that the culpability or ignorance of the high officers rendered his command much less useful then it ought to be i do not love willie any more my tenderness for him could scarcely have admitted increase but this feeling is now joined with a sort of proud satisfaction that he is now doing his clear and manifest duty and i am so deeply thankful that this course has resulted in an improvement of his health may god graciously preserve him unto the end father brought me word yesterday that mary stevens and mrs kenison were coming out to spend the night the night with us mrs kenison was going on the stage to shreveport thence by boat to alexandria to see her husband who is sick we expected them of course but the carriage did not drive up until twilight meeting mrs kenison first after greeting her i turned to mary as i supposed how great was my surprise to see a figure a foot shorter it was mrs lemmy who had come with mrs kenison as mary found she could not leave home i was so much disappointed and was not at all consoled by her short note which only said it is impossible without any reason for the impossibility however she promised to come soon and though that is very indefinite still it affords some ground for expectation i received a delightful letter from miss mary saturday answered it yesterday she writes with all the unaffected freedom which is so pleasant in her manners her letter was ten days on the way she was very homesick this i hope has worn off now that she has commenced school and become engrossed in her studies i shall hope for a letter from eva next saturday shall not hear as often as i expected since the mail leaves homer but once a week it is very cold indeed today mrs kenison was obliged to rise very early this morning and from some misunderstanding about the hour the stage started she was ready three hours or more before the time she rose at two o'clock of course we were all awake i slept no more at all but lay talking to her until dawn my usual time for rising our room was very warm and we had a cup of hot coffee at about three so she was quite comfortable her escort as far as shreveport is lieut henry holmes who called for her this morning i am afraid all her wrappings and hot bricks will hardly prevent suffering from the cold today it was so clear yesterday evening that we hoped the weather would moderate but it is even colder today than yesterday the sun has shone but water has been freezing all day long we have a very warm fire in the dining room which has been kept up all day but though i am only three or four feet from it my right hand is quite numb mother has taken a walk to mrs craig's to warm her the three little boys are gone with her and father and i are here alone he is quite engrossed in o'meara's napoleon at st helena and this together with a very severe cold keeps him confined to the fireside i spent the first part of my afternoon very delightfully in a careful perusal of two of blair's lectures on rhetoric i think it is such an admirable and agreeable book i am so fond of the study of rhetoric and language in every form and this book is so clear and easy that it is perfectly intelligible and enjoyable even to such a tyro as i am while it seems to me that its gracefulness and accuracy must be agreeable to the most polished taste i forgot to say above that mrs lemmy left about ten o'clock this morning she is a kind hearted credulous talkative little woman and though full of simplicity is not free either from affectation or a sort of childlike conceit there now i have multiplied adjectives and descriptive nouns enough for the most marvellous heroine of the most commonplace novel the general resource of those who feel the feebleness of their descriptive powers
monday october 7th 1861 i have waited until the seventh day of the month has almost past to write in my journal the past week has been a busy one to me almost every day i went visiting tuesday mrs cauthorn and miss puss bry spent the day with us wednesday our society met and i spent the morning at the church thursday i spent at major bry's friday i went up to the meeting of the summerfield society i went on horseback with capt marks and miss phoebe friend and enjoyed myself very much saturday i went to walk with the misses bry started right after dinner and did not get home until nearly dark besides all this i have scalloped two flannel skirts knit half a sock for john and written one whole morning and i have been labouring under a severe cold nearly all the time this morning i have been very busy compiling society reports a work of considerable labour since all the donations with their donors must be put down and to omit a single pair of socks is a great negligence i went over my minutes five or six times to see that nothing had been left out and then compared tables and amounts until i was heartily tired but it is all done now and i can feel a little better contented this reason of all this trouble is that our society has separated from the one at monroe and i wished to make out a report of every thing we had done father has been improving slowly since i wrote last he is still weak he went to vicksburg wednesday and was very much fatigued when he returned home he and mother have gone to monroe today mrs batchelor has taken the academy in monroe so that hope is past we have written to two other teachers a great calamity befel uncle moses the other day on last wednesday the temporary scaffolding around his bridge fell down and killed one of his workmen besides wounding one or two the weather is quite cool now we had some very warm days last week but it rained last night and is momentarily getting colder we go on another great chinquapen hunt tomorrow saturday oct 12th we took our chinquapen hunt as we contemplated had a very pleasant time father went with us and charley went to shake the trees we walked there and back again and gathered chinquapens all day we were very tired when we got home carrie young did not go she could not have walked mrs marks misses puss and hannah bry and florence stayed to supper with us while we were talking after supper mrs bry sent up word to miss puss to ask of she was coming home that night mrs bry had been very uneasy about them and thought they were lost in the woods the brys moved to monroe yesterday we were sorry to lose their company are going to move down to their house monday mother was threatened with a raised breast day before yesterday she took a violent cold and increased it by going to the society she is up today miss mary had a chill wednesday another thursday and another yesterday she missed it today and has been up all the afternoon miss newcomb and her sister miss bennett spent the day with us wednesday i was very glad to see them miss bennett is pleasant but i do not like her so well as miss newcomb the weather is very pleasant now cool and clear this morning it was very cold but it is warmer now lynhurst oct 16th 61 we have moved our fifth move since leaving georgia has been completed we shall have to make one more and i hope that will prove the last we commenced moving monday and all slept here last night i came down early yesterday morning and remained all day putting things in order as they were brought down it was a dull leaden day and about dusk it commenced to rain there had been no time to bring a load of wood and when the night came on cold and damp we had only a few sticks to make a blaze in the chimney still the neat blue carpet on the floor the white beds mahogany stand and rocking chairs drawn close to the fire place made a homelike picture as seen by the mild light of the kerosene lamp i was tired and mother was nearly sick with the colic we had to sit for father and miss mary who had gone to vicksburg the heavy rain pouring down on the roof was no pleasant reminder of their cold ride home and although i read aloud from the fascinating conquest of peru the hours wore away heavily till the rumbling of the carriage wheels announced their coming they were both wet having crossed the ferry in the rain and our little fire was not a sufficiency for them however we soon went to bed and i at least forgot my cares in sound refreshing sleep when i rose this morning my limbs were very stiff but this soon wore off i have spent a very quiet day unpacking and arranging my writing materials looking over my papers to select a piece for miss puss bry's album writing letters and writing my journal besides putting away clothes and sundry other little things father is president and superintendant of the railroad i suppose it was necessary he should be but if it could have been avoided it would have been a great pleasure to me now he will have to be away from home a great deal i am sorry too on dr young's account it deprives him of his situation i went to church sunday at chapel hill saturday oct 19th 61 when i wrote last i forgot to say that we have had quite a naval victory on the mississippi last saturday commodore hollins made an attack on the blocading vessels with six boats having in all only sixteen guns and three hundred men he had an old steamboat all encased in iron as a sort of battering ram this boat was called the mannassas it ran into one of the largest ships and sank it the rest of the blockading fleet were very much frightened several vessels got aground our boats took one schooner loaded with coal more vessels would probably have been sunk but for a disarrangement in the machinery of the manassas caused by the violence of the shock we rejoice greatly over this victory it seems as it the united states must soon see the folly of their present course and grant us peace father mother and i went into monroe thursday georgie went with us he had his hair cut off i could not bear the idea of having it cut but he did look very cunning after it was done he looks so much like willie now he is delighted with the idea of having his hair cut like father's thinks himself entirely above wearing frocks any longer we went to the sewing society to mrs roane's mrs bry's and to mrs steven's to dine while we were waiting on the steps of the society room for the carriage to come from the barber shop mrs calderwood and miss hanna being the only ladies left there mrs calderwood asked mother to go over to her house and wait there for the carriage she urged her invitation and we accordingly went over she regaled us with pears apples and pecans and when father came for us bade us goodbye with many courteous invitations on each side we found major bry's family very well all were at home except miss hannah who was at cottonport with mrs cauthorn aunt june was quite well i think miss mary stevens mrs steven's neice a very pleasant young lady i hope to form her acquaintance upon a more extended scale on our way home we stopped at mrs maguire's she is judge lemie's sister a very pleasant lady has been living at her present residence forty years this of itself is enough to render her interesting in this country where almost every one has recently moved here we have had very disagreeable weather it commenced raining thursday night and has been either raining or misting ever since the sun came out this afternoon and it seems to have settled into cold weather father has come from monroe
saturday oct 10th 62 this is an ever memorable week to me for this week we moved downstairs and i feel once more at home yes at home again after five years of wandering five years in which i have experienced my first considerable trials my first disappointments five years in which i known much happiness and lastly greatest of all years in which i hope i believe that i have been able to see the light that dwells in darkness and to draw near to the holy of holies my heart fills with gratitude as i look around my quiet comfortable room with its white curtains and coverings and all my furniture disposed just as suits me then the warm sun comes in at the south windows and on the west i look out on the beloved hillside still green but which will soon be brightened by the many colored hues of autumn it is quite cold today and it was not till ten o'clock this morning that the sun was able to penetrate through the cold gray clouds which covered the sky but now it is shining brightly and i no longer shiver though i still wear a shawl this morning we had three men here to breakfast who were on their way to get salt for the volunteer's families they told father if ever he was in their country and wanted a meal to come to them we are all confederate brothers you know said one while we were at dinner a man came up and asked one of the servants if he could get dinner for six are they soldiers said mother they don't look like it ma'am she answered well said mother tell them they can't have dinner i have only enough for my own family he went out but the other four came in said they were soldiers we all begged for them and mother sent miss mary out to tell them to come in there were three texans guarding a deserter he was an irishman who had been hired as a substitute we all pitied him very much but he did not seem at all distressed reuben came back from the salt works yesterday i received a letter from miss valeria day before yesterday angus had been home on a furlough and john came out of the battle safe i was so glad to hear it father received a letter from mrs veader friday she had just arrived in savannah had been at the north two years she said we could form no idea of the bitterness of feeling at the north she has a brother imprisoned by them in new orleans he was arrested without knowing for what we heard today of a defeat sustained by price and vandorn from rozencrans despicable german they say however that there were twelve yankees to our one we have heard no particulars but father says he thinks van dorn must be to blame for price is to good a general to give battle under such circumstances at any rate we cannot expect to have so many victories with not one reverse wednesday oct 15th father left us yesterday evening to be absent a whole month how long the time seems he is gone to georgia we have a poor woman staying here tonight for whom my heart bleeds she went down to the camps on horseback with her baby only seven months old to nurse her husband when she arrived there this morning she found him dead and buried she is now on her way back to her sad home she is a very young woman apparently quite poor and has no parents living as i hear her deep and frequent sighs from the adjoining room i can only pity her and be grateful for all the blessings that surround me oh how many many such widows this war will make nay has already made scarcely a family but has lost one member willie has not been very well today and yesterday saturday he took a ride of thirty miles after some oxen and again monday since then he has been very tired mrs young has a baby boy born today tuesday oct 28th 62 oh how cold it has been i shiver to think of it saturday night my flowers froze in my room and i could not keep warm in bed though i had a quantity of cover sunday it was still cold and froze again that night monday we could not have school on account of the weather today it is quite pleasant but is still cold i spent saturday with the misses compton passed a very pleasant day in the evening col gibson from mallison parish who has been up at the salt works making salt came in he is a very pleasant gentleman indeed mrs dwight moved into her new room yesterday it is all ceiled and therefore more comfortable than the other though she cannot yet have a fire for the chimney is not quite finished i have not been able to have a fire in my room yet on that account they are building the brickkiln now and i hope the chimneys will be finished before we have any more such cold weather my poor little valeria had some of her leaves frozen the other night but one side is still green and untouched i could not bear for it to die it's name endears it to me we have not heard from father since he left the two weeks past seem a long time and i long for the next two to be past we have heard of a victory gained by bragg over buell in kentucky the battle is said to have taken place some weeks ago but we have not yet heard any particulars of it carrie young came over here yesterday evening she looks quite thin mr drake called here this morning has been to texas he was looking very well
bayou tensas still thursday morning oct 1st in my same post on the back piazza but how changed the scene the willows and tall forest trees are brilliantly green the field of weeds waves and glistens in the clear wind and bright light and the belt of woods beyond is no longer dim though the bright haze of distance is between us it is a luxury to gaze on the sky no longer dim and changeless with the drifting grey clouds but full of life and beauty and movement clusters and groups of white fleecy clouds variable as the shadows float between us and the deep bright blue of the sky such beautiful clouds now shading a while the glorious sun now letting a full flood of light on wood and fields the mud is still here for the sun only came out this morning but with all this beauty and cheer overhead and this gentle but spiriting wind we are apt to tolerate more easily the muck and mire below what spectacle can equal that of the sky ever varying ever full of meaning whether dark or bright there is always interest there well may humbolt say that clouds give as much character to a landscape as terrestrial objects they give more the earth is the body the firmament is the life the soul our poor little plants are out in the sun today the little heliotropes are wilting under his strong beams but they will revive by and by father went away this morning to the river to find out a way for us to cross he may come back tomorrow night but i hardly hope to see him till sunday he says when he returns we shall be decided one way or another eva took quinine this morning and i hope will miss her chill georgie looks a little pale i hope he will not be sick montgomery's plantation choctaw bayou.friday oct 2nd 1863 yesterday the mud dried so much and this morning the sun rose so clear and bright that we prepared cheerfully for the days journey it is a bright pleasant day with a cloudless sky above but we soon found that the mud was still bad enough to render travelling very unpleasnat father rode railroad away so miss mary was obliged to go in the buggy and i rode on alone for some distance until willie came up from the wagons our road lay through open fields the greater part of the way field after field sometimes a mile across where the woods which bounded them looked almost blue from distance fields covered with corn and often luxuriant peavines grown without other care than simply planting the plantations are separated only by rail fences not belts of woodland as at home we only passed through one or two miles of woodland in our journey of twelve miles and really it was not very pleasant our horses labouring through the muddy roads and the sun beaming hot upon our unsheltered heads mollie did not like it at all she is a little lame again too i hated to have her tread in the mud so but could not help it we came along quite steadily only stopping for water once or twice for water during the whole time and arrived here about two or three o'clock this gentleman has three plantations and only one overseer when we rode up to this place and asked if them was a white man here they told us no he was at the lower place about a mile distant so we wearily caught up our reins and rode on when we get there and saw the overseer he said he would sell us corn at a dollar and a half a bushel when he cannot begin to gather what he has he asked us if this was mr watling's train and we answered yes then followed several remarks and he at last advised us to come back here to the first place as there was a very good vacant house and water for men and stock so we crossed the long bridge which i dread i never could bear to cross a bridge on horseback and we were soon established in this clean little house which has several white plastered rooms a piazza in front and a little porch behind the little inclosed lot is covered with bermuda grass in front separated by a fence is the negro quarter the ground is covered with bermuda grass and there is a wide street with the neat white washed cabins on each side each house has two rooms with a nice brick chimney and an open roof in front paved underneath with brick to keep them out of the mud there is no dwelling house on this place the negros call this the doctor's house i suppose the physician on the place used to live here it is quite a comfortable little place and i suppose some ladies stayed here for there is a discarded hoop skirt hanging in one of the rooms we are to stay here until father returns he may come tonight but we can hardly hope to see him until sunday mr duvall says we got on wonderfully well today only broke a yoke that was easily repaired for we have extra new ones with us i believe we have no really sick ones today though eva is pale and georgie looks badly eva missed her chill yesterday and today and i hope will not have any more choctaw bayou saturday evening oct 3rd i have just returned from a pleasant walk down to the bayou where it widens into a lake and an hours pleasant idleness sitting an the trunk of a large cypress tree lying out in the water with the solemn moss hung cypress branches over our heads and looking at the grave white cranes sitting motionless on the bank or flapping slowly from one side to the other now and then one would wade out into the stream stretch his long neck out and stand motionless watching the water we amused ourselves very much observing all their motions at first we counted all we saw but soon found too many to count there were two or three of what are called blue cranes but we were not as much interested in these as in the snowy white ones we were quite excited when george pointed out an alligator lying on some limbs projecting from the water not far from our standpoint we tried chunking at him with bark he was a little fellow but he paid no attention to that and eva and i went back to the stump of the tree to get some chips but before we were half way on our return miss mary cried out he is gone the shore of the bayou near where we sat was grown up in places with cypress knees of a thousand grotesque shapes some groups of them if inverted would have looked just like great brown icicles the growth of the cypress tree is so singular and what is strange in this day of popular information i have never seen any notice of it in books of travel this growth may not be an isolated one in botany but i never heard of any like it these knees as they are called are the germs of the future tree they grow up like stumps covered with bark and rounded on the top from which fact they take their name of knees not a bud or sign of a leaf is seen anywhere about them i have never seen any in the transition state but mr duvall says they grow thus quite tall sometimes higher than a man and than all at once put out branches i should like very much to see some of them budding i think the cypress is a beautiful tree this grey moss sems more appropriate to them than to any other the trees on this lake are principally cypress draped always with moss miss mary and loring are hurrying me they want to go down to the lake and take a boat ride so i suppose i must leave my book though i am very unwilling monday oct 5th tensas bayou it is our task now to retrace our steps the idea of going to georgia and all the anticipations doubtful pleasurable painful which it engendered are left behind us we must do our best to forget them i said forget but i did not mean no we must never forget this journey its bodily and mental trials and its joys for joys it has had for me the experience the disappointment is useful i hope i trust it may not be long before we can say from our hearts the bud may have a bitter taste but sweet will be the flower the bud has indeed a bitter taste we will not deny that it is best to admit it to receive the bitterness and profit by it yesterday evening father returned from the expedition to the river and be brought the unwelcome intelligence that we had been refused a passport but i will repeat something of what father told us after a full account of his journey to rodney he said that when he arrived there he beckoned to the ferry boat which was a flat owned by two negro men the gun boat lay in the middle of the river and he wanted the men to take him out to it they said all the skiffs had just been destroyed by the gunboat and when he asked if they could not take him out in that they demurred and confered apart some time father perceived at length that they were troubled about the price he asked them what they charged to ferry any one across they said ten dollars over and ten back father afterwards learned that the regular price was five dollars he asked them if they would not take him out to the gun boat for that price and they willingly acquiesced when father got out to the boat the lieutenant received him and told him he could not come on board asked his business father told him he desired to see the commander of the boat the lieutenant was in command for the captain with a squad of his men had recently been captured in a church at rodney father told the lieutenant that he came to ask permission to cross the river with his family be enquired if father was in the army no you think you ought not to be there i suppose no on the contrary i think if i were of the proper age and had no impediment i ought to be there well sir was his final answer you cannot cross here father bade him good morning and went on to natchez when he arrived there he immediately went to the gen'ls office when he told his business to the usher he was told that he must go to the provost marshall he went there and was told he could not then be attended to must return at two o'clock at two o'clock he returned and after waiting about an hour the provost came father then prefaced his story by telling him that he was the president of the v'bg shreveport and texas railroad intending to tell him about the negroes but here the provost stopped him by telling him that he knew that he then asked father if he considered himself a loyal citizen father said yes a loyal citizen of the confederate states i suspected as much and you come here asking me to assist you in crossing the river no father said i come here asking permission to go across without being molested i ask no assistance you cannot have that permission if you cross the river you cross at your peril father asked him if it would be of any use for him to go to the general he told him no that he had just come from the general's office where he had been conferring with him on this very subject and the general said be must use his own discretion father then said to him as a mere matter of curiosity i would like to know how you received your information about me the reply was your curiosity cannot be gratified sir thus in a few words were crushed all our hopes of getting yankee permission it cost them little to speak these words but how much it cost us to hear them but even in hearing i felt a sort of exultation in thinking that now we owed them nothing not even a word of kindness yes they have refused us the only favour we have yet asked them we are not oppressed by any sense of obligation to them father says while he was in natchez he saw old grey haired men and women come to the provost to ask permission to buy some common necessary of life the people living in the city have to bring to the provost a written memoranda of what they want to by however insignificant the article and then when they have bought it they have to bring a bill of it back to the same officer father says the city is orderly no doubt with such a rule after telling us all this father said the decision was still to make we could go on and endeavour to cross the river if we chose or we could go back home the two ways were before us he could not decide he did not know which was best and he thought mother ought to make the decision we might possibly get across the river but it was almost certain that we would be discovered and if we were he felt sure from what he had seen and learned that the yankees would deprive of everything literally everything we possessed and leave us on the bank of the river thus destitute on the other hand if we went back we knew what we went to it was present safety at least though undoubtedly privation willie was in favour of making the attempt but father and mr duvall and mr burke all thought the risk too great and mother was appalled at the prospect of utter destitution if we were discovered so at length it was decided that we were to turn back and father called up the negroes to tell them the decision they were all attentive while he told them and while he added that he had seen in those few days all kinds of suffering that he ever expected to see he had seen the graves of negroes as thick as the heads before him he had seen acres of the most miserable little huts opposite natchez where the negroes were staying and negro women up to their knees in water paddling out clothes for want of tubs he had passed one plantation where there were a hundred negroes with no overseer and they had not a morsel of salt and but little meat all the able bodied negro men were put in the army the others were left to shift for themselves father told them that he thought he should be able to feed and clothe them for another year here but that if he were to be discovered in the attempt to cross the river he should be as powerless as nancy's baby there the negroes assented mark said he was willing to go back and save what little was left and so they all said it is a sad disappointment to lonzo and uncle levi they were so anxious to go back to georgia and so were a few others father promised them that they should go there as soon so possible so it was all said and he went in the house and thought of the past day and of the morrow and my poor father looked so troubled and perplexed and so kind and good in my childhood i used to think that my father could never fail in anything he has failed in this attempt to cross the mississippi but in this very failure i love him and respect him more and he is nobler in my eyes than any man in his success then even he in his success if it could be that i could love him respect him more such truth and strength and humility i can never see united in any other my father this is full for me of happiness and goodness i am more sorry on willie's account than any other i was so in hopes he could be with john angus but it may be best for him to be here father speaks of trying to get him into harrison's battalion of cavalry willie said he did not want to go over the other side unless we went too we left the montgomery place this morning quite early and came over the field to the tensas by twelve o'clock of course the ox teams did not get here till later it is now nearly three o'clock and they are not all crossed yet we have established our camp on the east side of the tensas just above the ferry third return camp bogue chitto thursday oct 8th i have let two days pass without an entry in this journal which ought to be faithfully and punctually kept i have neglected it for no other reason than just because i did not feel like writing a poor reason indeed we left our camp at the tensas as early as possible in the morning of wednesday the ox wagons preceded us for we remembered the rough road made worse by the recent rain and hoped that the heavy wagons would smooth the stiff ruts a little notwithstanding they did smooth it very much they made some of the holes worse and the ten miles drive was very wearying however we reached the maçon and forded it by twelve o'clock which we thought was very good driving after resting an hour in which we lunched fed the horses and cattle we again took up our march having set winsboro for our night's camping place it is twelve miles distant from the maçon and a long and weary twelve miles it was to me mollie was so lame that traveling was painful to herself and her rider and i could not chase away by a short galop as is my wont the painful thoughts that lengthened the miles to me when we came into the beautiful woods i recalled the reflections of my sabbath ride through them and they again brought peace and resignation to my soul gladly we hailed the sight of the open common and the spreading oak under which we rested on sunday it was late before our supper was over and we were ready to lie down to sleep until morning so we thought but not so it proved for about one o'clock we were aroused by mr burke's calls to his staff it was his watch and by the running to and fro to get the women children and bedding under shelter we rubbed open our sleepy eyes put on our frocks and got the children up fretting at being awakened miss mary and willie went on miss mary with a lantern and willie with john in his arms they went to a little house with two rooms which was fortunately on the edge of the common hither we all fled except father he stayed at the tent to attend to things there when arrived at the cabin we got into the room where there was a fireplace and found the small fire kindled and several negroes gathered around it they made room for us and we gathered around mother in a chair the rest on the floor some lying and some sitting after the rain lulled a little we sent down a negro man who brought up two blankets a large shawl and two pillows the children stretched themselves on and under these and i lay beside george for awhile but soon gave my place to mother for i preferred her chair from my seat i amused myself between naps with the scene around stretched with their feet on the fireplace and their forms making the radii of a half circle around it were the white family all seeming sound asleep ranged around the sides of the room were the negroes in various grotesque positions some sitting propped up against the wall some wrapped in quilts and blankets giving no indication that it was other than a pile of bed clothing except by the loud snore that came from its depths others were lying without blanket or quilt and jeff having quietly taken off his coat and laid it under willie's head w was so sound asleep he did not know it had seated himself on the edge of one of the boards which formed part of the wall of this dilapidated house was sleeping as quietly as if on a bed of down through the unshuttered door i saw the floor covered with sleeping negroes lying close together covered scantily or not at all but most of them better provided for than we opposite me by the corner of the fireplace lonzo was seated on the floor a basket which he seemed to consider very valuable by his side and his arms embracing his knees which formed a resting place for his head all this i saw by the light of the dying fire and it was very interesting to me it was at that hour when sleep naturally takes possession of the whole animated world there was no sound except the loud quiet breathing of the sleepers and now and then a snore at last the morning broke the negroes waked or were wakened singly and in groups and scattered out of the house and after combing out my hair and pinning it up i gathered up my skirts and walked through the wet grass down to the camp ground passing several fires i came to ours lonzo exhausted by his watch the night before was stretched on the board and again asleep i enquired of charlie where father was and he directed me to the tent i found father there lying on a pile of mattresses carpents and so covered up with blankets comforts that at first i could not find him he looked haggard when i did see him and wakened with a start at my kiss oh my dear father how much trouble how much wearying anxiety he has now we found that we need not have moved so precipitately the night before for our carpet tent had not leaked at all only a little rain had blown in at one end father had not had time to get the bedding in the wagon before the rain came had lain down under the tent and slept all night as i watched the sun rise triumphant over the flying clouds that morning i thought with thompson here come the powerful god of day triumphant in the east it was a glorious sight and a glad one to us i am afraid i must confess that the thoughts of the grandeur of the sight were soon followed by a comfortable thought that the bright sunlight would dry the wet grass and sloppy roads the wagons left camp about seven o'clock we followed in an hour or so we had gone about a half a mile when we perceived the mule wagon drawn drawn to a halt and all the other mule equipages in front the carriage had not yet started from camp when we came near enough loring called to emmeline broke down she bobbed her head and we knew our fate we knew it better and with more anxiety though when on riding up we saw anthony's wagon turned over in a deep and wide ditch its load partly thrown out and the negroe men up to their knees in water around working at the body the brood wheel of the wagon had slipped off the bank and all had gone into the ditch together poor antony whose negligence had caused it all looked quite crestfallen they were still in the ditch crying out and heaving and directing when father's troubled voice broke in upon us all had been so busy they had not noticed his approach antony immediately commenced his excuse but it was quite lost in father's reproof at length the wagon was pulled up on the bank again and then the extent of the evil was learned the back wheel the same one that was filled at la fourche was completely smashed up which means it was to be filled over entirely well the end was that they put a drag under the axle hung the wheel on the back of another wagon and started but not by any means as easily as i have written it miss mary and i with the children came on followed by the mule teams mother waited behind for father we the advance guard arrived here before twelve and drew up on our old camping place in the grove we went up to the house just opposite to see mrs smith about corn and fodder a shelter but she was gone to winsboro and there was no one at home but a mr williams a boarder as he informed us he gave us quite an autobiography of himself but did not know anything about our business except that we could get corn and fodder and that he reckoned mrs smith would let us have what else we wanted as she was very accommodating to strangers had been ever since he had been there and that was two months more we have not found her very obliging but let that pass the poor woman has seen much sorrow she has lost her husband and thirteen children on this very place her last child died a few months since mr williams told us that she was a beautiful child of five years old the kindest child to be so much spoiled of any he ever saw the poor man has none of his own i expect it was quite late in the afternoon before the wagons arrived and they were ready to commence on the broken wheel but lonzo and sandy and father all worked with other subordinates and they advanced rapidly the wheel is now nearly completed and it is only about twelve o'clock i have been writing by snatches nearly all the morning first seated by the camp fire where mother and mr duvall were talking on subjects very interesting to me and for a time when willie came up i ceased writing altogether now i am in the carriage by georgie who has had a chill and now is sleeping off the fever the dear little fellow is so still and patient that he does not interrupt me much my poor little darling his face is sadly pale and is growing quite sallow i wish he were well like john who is still plump and red cheeked as ever and as mischievous two soldiers paid us a visit this morning they are from bragg's army left since the fight two good looking well behaved young men one had lost a finger in the fight poor young man he was so strikingly like horace the same blue eye and yellow moustache and same expression of lip only he was short and horace was quite tall i remember him well though it has been six years since i saw him last but i have quite digressed from my subject it was that of the fight this soldier says the two days saturday and sunday we gained a great victory after that there was only cannonading until they left since then they have heard that rosencrans was captured he had been driven to chattanooga and we had possession of lookout mountain d h hill and longstreet were near though not i believe in the action oh i hope it is all true this soldier said there were a heap of men killed up there how sadly true many a man and no man died to himself alone this soldier also told us that someone had tried to cross the mississippi last week with a wagon and had been taken i did say it is best after all that we did not attempt all other considerations i could cast behind me but oh if willie could only be with angus and john i should feel as if i had three brothers together almost though willie is dearer infinitely dearer than they can be though they are valeria's brothers i must not forget an important thing i learned this morning old mr cole came down here to see about buying the lumber we brought along for a flat and while he asked how i and molly got along he was very much delighted with molly the day we stopped at his house i then entered into an explanation of my grievances and he told me he knew a certain cure for the swinney he had cured many a horse i eagerly took it down and am going to try it in good faith though mr duvall does say he don't believe it can cure her the weather is now clear and fine just cool enough we shall only follow our old road as far as the boeuf where we take a road up by girard to leave the negroes there i am glad we are to take a different road though i should like to see the beautiful forest of the la fourche again but i dread it's bad bridge for the wagons our old encampment there has such painful associations that i do not wish to see it again till our prospects are brighter boeuf river fourth return camp friday morning oct 9th last night we arrived at our old camp here pitched our tent on the same place and tied the mules to the same tree as we did before we left bogue chitto at about one o'clock and arrived here at sunset without any accident this evening found us all more cheerful than we have hitherto been and we sat round the camp fire and talked some time after supper leaving out almost entirely the subject of our future prospects today we hope to make crew lake a few miles beyond girard this will be a new road for us molly is still very lame hardly able to carry me she was yesterday evening i hope she may be improved this morning i believe i have nothing more to write of importance and miss mary wants to go down and see the wagons ford i should not object were it not for my remembrance of the oaths with which the first crossing here was accompanied the sound of profanity makes me feel sick at heart i wonder how men can dare to take the holy name in vain millhaven saturday oct 10th 1863 we are almost at our journey's end now indeed this is the end of the journey for the railroad negroes and mr duvall and mr burke for here they separate from us father is going to leave the negroes on mr gordon's place they are to gather corn and live down here untill he can form some better plan mr o'leary left us yesterday at girard willie says he felt very badly at leaving and could not finish a sentence asking father if ever he worked on a railroad again to remember him we left boeuf river yesterday morning quite early and came on steadily to girard the road was very good and led through pretty shady woods somehow our spirits seemed quite high i don't know how it happened for we do not often enjoy high spirits lately we started at first with the ox teams but passed ahead of them and miss mary and i had a delightful and exhilarating galop with willie which contributed very much to our cheerfulness we stopped about seven miles from the ford to get water and the old negro woman who brought it out asked me where we were going when i told her she asked if we had not passed a certain house on our way said she was there and that she knew miss mary and i as soon as she saw us they had moved from the manchac down near new orleans and now wished themselves back this is the story everyone tells i wish i were home again as for me i was reluctant to leave home and now so contradictory am i that i do not long to get back at all that is as for as i am concerned i do indeed wish for repose for father and mother they both look weary and worn we stopped for dinner yesterday at mrs raines place mr myrick's mother in law but found to our regret that they had all moved a week ago started for the west somewhere after eating our little lunch we came on to girard halted there a little while for father to see mr baldwin and then came on through the swamp the green trees grew thick around us and underneath them the grass spread a carpet of verdure all brightened by the western waves of ebbing day we wound slowly along the crooked road rough and broken into mud holes very often and it was almost dusk when we arrived at mr john webb's here father stopped a few minutes to speak to mr webb who came out to welcome him with much cordiality and who invited us to remain in his house during the night but we thought we had better camp as usual and drove over crew lake to what mr webb pronounced the best camping place we ever saw we found it quite a good one indeed and i at least was rejoiced to arrive there the oxteams came up about dark none at all broken which was quite fortunate over the rough road one wheel had two or three spokes cracked but that was done in driving up the hill at the ford when the wagon ran into a gulley and came very near turning over we had hardly got established at our camp before we heard a sound of hearty greetings and laughing and very soon mr duvall ushered up to the fire one whom he introduced as captain justice he in an old acquaintance of father's and i have several time heard of him he is such a character i have not talent sufficient to draw his remarkable traits he is a small old man wrinkled and hoary and looking quite weather beaten though his eye is as bright and his manner as lively as that of a much younger man he says he has been here a long time he is now nearly sixty four years old been here a long time how much poetry is there in this expression it reminds me somewhat of the answer of the patriarch jacob to pharaoh capt justice is a man of temper boldness and bravery it seems and withal kind hearted and upright his conversation sprightly and interesting though his language is rude and i was so much entertained in listening to him last night that i almost forgot that i had eaten no supper and that i was tired and sleepy oh he is such a funny figure and has such a funny way of shutting his mouth and twinkling his eye when the yankees passed through here he ambushed himself near his daughter's house with his gun and horse and watched their movements he said he could easily have killed one or two but thought he would not trouble them unless they interfered with the women and then they should have paid for it certing he said if he had only known that they were going to camp where they did on boeuf river he would made many of them fall that night this is the hardy language of a pioneer of the old times and father says he would not have failed to act up to it this morning he paid us another visit and when mollie was led to water some of us remarked how very lame she was he enquired the cause and on hearing it was the swinney said immediately that he could cure it by rubbing turpentine well into the shoulder and then ironing it he offered to take mollie and cure her in three weeks i was only too glad to leave her with him as he promised so great a benefit though i hated to part with her willie's pet he always called her and i always think of her more as willie's pet than mine i shall never be able to thank captain justice enough if he cures her it was nearly ten o'clock when we were ready to go to bed last night and i slept heavily after the fatigue of the day this morning when i rose i was still drowsy and have been all day we did not leave our camp until quite late and had only advanced two or three miles when we came to the la fourche here we found part of a rough puncheon bridge connected with the opposite by an old flat resting on the muddy bottom and with the floor all broken out mr burke succeeded in getting his mule over by pulling the bridle hard in front while father and uncle jim beat it behind uncle dick also crossed his cart and the buggy went over but further crossing was found impracticable and father went to work to repair the bridge the negroes soon came up and it was not long before they had poles cut down and the flat floored over with the loose planks lying about we crossed in safety and then laboured on through the swamp for a long way the sight of this la fourche made me feel sick i rode in the buggy today with loring and eva and did not find the change very pleasant yesterday when we stopped for dinner willie found that his dog watch was gone steve said he thought he was back at the ford and so after some little debating willie sent him back on brandon to get him steve is a real dog tamer and when he walks along with a gun on his shoulder and surrounded by dogs playing around his feet he reminds me forcibly of rip van winkle his figure adds to the picture very much he is tall and stoop shouldered and one of his legs crooks outward at the knee which gives him a loose shuffling gait and which has gained him the name of crooked steve he always has a good natured grin on his wide mouth our journey today has been a very fatigueing one through the swamp the road was very rough and when we got out of it we mistook the road and after travelling for four or five miles and going through a long sunny field where the deep furrows knocked our heads together constantly we had the pleasure of learning that our road was wrong and retraced our steps under mr duvall's direction who had ridden up to inform us of our mistake we were following uncle levi who said he knew all about the roads and really he would have led us right if we had followed him a little further he persevered in his own way and arrived here before we did when we got back into the right road father was troubled about uncle levi and went back on foot to see if he had broken down and we came and mother waited for father and altogether we all got confused and irritated and heartily tired at last we all arrived here before sunset a little and got into this little house and set to cooking and preparing for the night it is now dusk our supper is on the table one we found here and we are only waiting for father who is now coming none of us have had a morsel since breakfast millhaven monday oct 12th yesterday father found that he had something to arrange here which would make it necessary for him to remain a day or two longer than he expected and he came to the conclusion that it would be best to send me on as avant coureur to dr whyte to let him know we were coming and to inform him of our circumstances so loring and i are to go this morning in the buggy and come back tomorrow our affairs look perplexing now mr duvall was taken sick yesterday and father says looks quite badly this morning so that father does not like to leave him alone to the care and trouble of the negroes and he has no one else to leave i hope it will all grow clearer soon i have often seen that light dawns just after the greatest darkness and i have faith that so it will be again i hope poor mr duvall may recover his strength i feel the more sorry for him since i have done his injustice in my own mind and now deeply regret it i have not time to write more eva is not well this morning and george has another chill oakland thursday night oct 15th 1863 our three weeks journey is safely ended i sit by the fire in my own old room and date my journal oakland once more around me everything is familiar but these things awaken no joy in my heart this coming home is sadder than any departure has ever been to me i feel my heart cold when i know it ought to be grateful i am grateful but i am so sad so coldly sad god forgive me and deliver me from my own sinful murmuring heart i have been busy today unpacking and arranging things we came home yesterday miss mary loring and i came in the buggy and arrived here at two o'clock the others stopped in town and were later the house looked lonely and strange the great empty rooms echoed to the sound of our voices and the yard was littered with fallen leaves and scraps of cotton even the beautiful bright sunlight seemed to fall coldly we tried to give the rooms a better aspect lighted a fire in the dining room and made it a little less lonesome by the time mother came father did not arrive till nearly sun down we got the bedsteads set up and beds made and partially unloaded the wagons then mrs willson and julia came in stayed only a few minutes and after they left we had a little bread and meat for supper called down the two poor couriers who had not eaten since morning it was late when we retired the day had been one of painful excitement and some fatigue to me and i was surprised this morning when i opened my eyes to find that it was broad day shining through the uncurtained windows but all was still and i slept again poor loring had a chill yesterday afternoon and another today georgie's turn comes tomorrow poor children i am sorry for them we parted from willie at millhaven yesterday he told father in the morning that he believed he might as well hire a substitute as go into the army on this side the river i could scarcely believe i heard correctly it would be the saddest sorrow i ever have known for willie to act thus but i trust he will not he afterwards asked father to see col harrison about taking him into his battalion father will see him tomorrow i sometimes fear i am wrong in my feelings about this matter but honour right patriotism all seem to me to point willie to the army i would be so unwilling for him to remain at home but i am afraid sometimes that i am wrong in wishing him so earnestly to go i shall never be happy while the war lasts if he does now in the prospect i recoil from thinking of him and ask myself if i am not cruel and unsisterly my heart is in chaos has been since yesterday morning the pleasure of seeing things take their old familiar place in the house of arranging furniture and bringing order out of confusion which used to be so delightful to me has now lost its charm my old room with even the glass of heliotrope on the bureau as of old and the firelight brightening the white curtains and bed covering and gleaming on polished mahogany fails to warm my heart if i know myself rightly this cannot last long the morning will come when i shall not be gloomy any longer but i feel i know that there is little joy for me it may be for a long time resignation i would make the mottoe of my life i say to myself over and over again how much blessed i am above many even in my circle of acquaintances but this thought though it causes my heart to fill with gratitude cannot make me blind to my trial and to feel that every human being has a cross given them a cross to be acknowledged borne not denied and avoided the true great words of thomas a kempis rise often in my soul i believe with him that trial is everywhere and for every human being my god give me strength patiently to bear what thou shalt appoint oakland oct 20th 1863 yesterday i recommenced my little school the children did very well better in fact than i had dared to hope i think i shall succeed better with them this winter than i did last oh if i could only interest them in their books i should consider it the highest blessing of my life to be able to do them any good we have gotten quite regulated now father has every one at work under his superintendance and the place has quite a different air from when we came here i have been doing a little work among my flowers putting fresh earth in the boxes separating violets and i have had the little garden manured and spaded the heliotrope in the garden is covered with blooms i have gathered four large goblets full since we returned amid all these duties i have succeeded by god's grace in subduing my bitter and complaining feelings i still feel sad very often but am yet cheerful my health is very good my face is full and rosy through the brown and good health always tends to make me cheerful there is nothing like work for me idle and aimless days make me melancholy and miserable father has seen col harrison about willie the col said he would be glad to have him join his regiment and promised to give him a furlough for thirty days intimating at the same time that it might be continued until january he has only authority to give furloughs for thirty days at a time willie is to come up and be sworn in today father has gone to monroe and willie will meet him there and return with him it seems like such a long time since we left him it is very warm today and looks like rain the cloudy sky is favourable to my little transplanted violets and to the bermuda grass father set out by the door yesterday afternoon the clock strikes nine and i must call up my four pupils wednesday oct 31st 1863 we were disappointed in seeing willie yesterday he could not have received father's note we expect him certainly today for father has sent again for him mother is going in town today to bring willie out and also to see mrs stevens who has returned to monroe father brought home some news last night which was quite sad for us to hear johnny davis is at work for the yankees or what is worse for a reprobate southerner called old montagu who is perfect traitor to the country and is working several plantations owned by refugees i am so sorry that johnny davis should act so it is disappointment too we all had such high opinion of him he wrote back to mr mcguire what he had done i should not have thought he could have so much hardihood as to write of it mother thinks there may be some extenuating circumstances as he is very young and his mother may have influenced him to act thus in view of her poverty and necessity we ought not to judge too harshly we can never know all the motives one has nor can we know the full strength of the temptations which assail others how often have i condemned when i thought myself fully warranted in doing so and afterwards have found the innocence of the supposedly guilty person and felt myself deeply regretful of my harsh judgment how true it is that god alone knows the hearts of his creatures and god alone should condemn i feel that it is my redeemer alone that mercifully saves me from being as guilty as many of my fellows we have not yet had the expected rain though it is still warm and cloudy too warm to continue long at this season yesterday we did better in school than the day before loring was quite passionate over his first reading lesson because i would not tell him every difficult word and george was a little reluctant to come in school but with these exceptions all went smoothly enough loring recited his other lessons perfectly and left the school room in high good humour friday oct 23rd wednesday evening willie came we were all so glad to see him john and george ran and clasped his knees the moment he alighted from the carriage and john immediately pulled him in the pantry to the safe to get him a piece of candy willie only remained one night the next morning he and father went to col harrison's camp where willie was sworn in and took his furlough he then went down to mill haven he says capt justice says that mollie is quite well except the healing of her shoulders he thinks he has stopped the swinny agnes willson spent the day with eva wednesday julia sent me by her a beautiful boquet of rich flowers dahlias cape jessemine lantanas hybiscus pomegranite and several others the long threatened rain came last night the whole day had been gloomy and cold and soon after supper the rain commenced accompanied by a cold wind it continued through the night and this morning as i sit by the fire writing the rain splashes regularly outside such a cold gloomy low rain and the heavens are so covered with clouds that i can with difficulty see to write so far from the window the melancholy days are come the saddest of the year the gentle race of flowers are lying in their lowly beds with the fair and good of ours the rain is falling where they lie but the cold november rain calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again these lines were in my thought last night and sadly my heart echoed them as i thought of a distant grave miss mary took her first music lesson from mrs delory yesterday she is to go in town twice a week to take a lesson loring drove her in yesterday with two of our pupils being absent we were only in the schoolroom an hour or two georgie is progressing can spell six seven words i do not make him learn the a b abs but have him read and learn words by observing them in sentences in connexion with others in this way he will not forget them and it is much more tolerable to him than the dry columns would be it has some disadvantages i know but fewer i think than the other way lucy seale and mrs norris rode up to see me wednesday afternoon lucy was dressed as she always is with the utmost neatness in black riding dress with white collar cuffs and black velvet cap with a white plume she told me that mrs wilbur compton had been very ill and had lost her little baby with the diptheria monday oct 26th i rose very early this morning the round moon was shining brightly into my west windows and did not set until i had been up some time father and i were the only ones stirring in the house so i have gained time to write and read a little before breakfast besides having my hour for devotion quiet and alone willie came home saturday night and spent sunday with us he is going back this morning he and mr duvall have moved up to mrs willson's place limerick where they are to remain until they gather her corn willie makes excursions continually in search of hogs and cattle and other animals for food so that he can scarcely be said to remain anywhere he looks so well now his health seems completely reestablished he has not had a sick day for a long time mr duvall poor man continues very delicate willie says he eats scarcely anything and when he does take a little meat and bread he says he has taken too much poor man i am so sorry for him mr mrs barr dined with us yesterday called on their way to homer from mrs barr's father's in tensas we were very glad to see them and sent many messages to them all at homer i should like so much to see mrs barr and mrs morancy and the baby i told mrs bowmar barr to tell mrs morancy to be sure and write to me dr mcdonough also dined with us yesterday so that with the company willie and the couriers we had quite a long table willie brought us some excellent mutton and beef when he came up so we gave them a very good dinner dr mcdonough has been over three times since we returned and now that we are getting a little acquainted i like him very well he is intelligent and well read i think and talks very well when he forgets his bashfulness we are getting quite settled now father is learning something about farming it is so amusing to hear him directing about the feeding of the pigs cows and mules and to hear him talking about plowing mother said she had a square in the garden she wanted ploughed for shalotts and he even said he thought he could plough that much himself although it is such a new and strange business to father he is bringing everything into order and improvements are going on all about oh i do so wish this might be our permanent home i mean our home for this short life but i suppose that cannot be i never look upon it as such now but now that we are getting settled down again and building houses and chimneys and talking about how our peach trees will bear next year and how grape vines must be set out in the spring and trees pruned and seeds sown i think how delightful it would be to work thus year after year and see one years work in the improvement of the next and the place is growing into my heart more closely and deeply i once thought it was parted forever but it was ordained otherwise i am reading cosmos again am only in the third volume for nearly half a year i had not opened the book until this last week i am reading kenilworth aloud we all find it extremely interesting but feel sad all the time that it must come to such an unhappy end i think no one ever drew characters and scenes more true than those of scott and such a multiplicity in that lies the wonder and the charm thursday oct 29th 1863 tuesday morning mrs willson sent to borrow the buggy and after a while mother decided to lend it to her and send miss mary in to her music lesson in the carriage and proposed that i should accompany her and go to see mary stevens so i went for i wished very much to see her and mrs stevens after leaving miss mary at mrs delary's i drove to mrs dr mcguire's only intending to spend a few moments for my errand was to get some hops for mother and to reborrow lamartine for myself but i lengthened my few minutes very astonishingly for i like mrs mcguire very much and could not break from her conversation continuous varied and interesting as well as discriminating and kind how many adjectives but they are all just she is of french parentage but married an american and retains her vivacity and penetration in her age and in spite of a life full of sorrow she has lost her husband and her family of children as well as many relatives her parlour is a perfect room of curious and pretty things so crowded together that one can hardly distinguish their beauties and the walls papered with the old fashioned large figures are hung up to the low ceiling with family portraits and good engravings then she has a large library and a greenhouse and a large garden from mrs mcguire's i went to mrs steven's where i met a quiet but warm welcome from may and her aunt mrs stevens looks sad and much older to me than when i saw her last may is much improved the stony look of sorrow has left her face and i have seldom seen a sweeter expression it beatified her plain features and after i returned home often while reading her large open blue eyes with their mild kind light and the softened smile on her mouth would come between me and the page and withdraw my attention from stars and planets to human life i read in may's face that her deep sorrow had been blessed to her and i am so glad yet her lot is a sad one resignation though peaceful is not joyous and how many many times the thought of her irreparable loss must come upon her if i with all my blessings am often yearningly sad what must she be we did not speak of their grief but once when i spoke of our return home mrs stevens said how blest we were to be able to return as we had left and i could say nothing while my heart wept for her and while i thought of my own wicked ingratitude on this same return we conversed cheerfully of many things and when miss mary called for me i regretted that we could not remain longer mrs stevens and may pressed so to do so but uncle jim was needed at home so we could not stay they said i must come and spend a week with them mrs stevens said it was so lonely i should like to very much but cannot think of it at present the children are getting so well commenced in school george is learning rapidly loring does very well and is improving today and yesterday i had some trouble with him but he has a cold and i had him commence a new lesson learning the states and capitals a difficult lesson for a child and i would not give it to him but i have no maps to teach it otherwise a large map of the former united states would be a great aid in our school room during our ride home from monroe miss mary entertained with a description of her lesson and her teacher and an account of a proposed concert near christmas but after she tired of talking and we had passed all the soldiers and rolled along the quiet road i thought of many things but my thoughts dwelt with a passionate yearning on my dear friend i thought of her far away maybe suffering i have no idea where she is have received no letter since july and my letter sent by johnny davis directed to miss harrison was i think taken by the yankees john gave it to a mr mckinny who was taken prisoner and searched on his way even if i knew where she was i have no opportunity of sending a letter i want to see her sometimes the longing grows painful i know that she loves me and i feel in her such a perfect confidence of sympathy oh there is nothing so comforting so lovely as a pure friendship nothing except that mystic bond of a pure love which for me is only can only be in imagination or in the lost and irrecoverable and in friendship there is a quiet sweetness which belongs to that alone a community of age of feelings of ideas exists between myself and valeria which i hold with no other i may be long separated from her but this true affection must ever be one of my greatest blessings my dearest joys sometimes i feel we shall never meet again but this is an idle fear it may be so but i should not let the anticipation of a possible evil trouble me it is now past sunset the short winter twilight is fading the day has been rainy and cloudy by turns and i am sitting by my window the sash is raised for the air is not cold the hillside is no longer green but varied with the rich colour of fall with a few green leaves and above all the dark strong tinted foliage of the pine the rosy light comes through the light clouds and pervades the air but as i write it grows dim and the darkness comes on but even the dusk has a tint of rose this is willie's twenty second birthday he was here yesterday but could not be at home on his birthday as we wished he only stayed to dinner with us yesterday he works so hard his aid is invaluable to father my dear father his cares wear upon him his expression is changed to one of constant care and anxiety and his voice has taken a tone of sadness that makes the tears start to my eyes when i hear it his talents are the same he still accomplishes very much but how it would gladden me to see again the clear bright glance of his eye i have never seen a man's eye with such a beautiful expression when he is well and happy it is so clear one feels that no falsity not the shadow of it is there and it strong and boyish in perfect innocence and it kind of gaiety and yet one feels that they can perfectly trust their life even to him i cannot express the expression i once pointed it out to valeria and she recognized it immediately
tuesday oct 11th 1864 two weeks since i wrote here but i have been too busy to write every hour has been fully employed last tuesday evening father and i rode in to trenton to see mrs seale who had just returned from her journey to the swamp we stopped at the post office to get the paper and found a letter from willie he was sick but fortunately had gotten into a private house and was hospitably entertained by one of the kindest ladies he ever saw on our return we met a young man who had dined with us that day who would stop in monroe that night on his way to virginia and who said he would take letters for us if we sent them in the next morning so i wrote short letters to aunt mary and grandma and one to valeria that seemed short to me though really it was quite long friday we were surprised by willie's arrival he came home on a furlough of thirty days just three weeks after he went away though a surprise to us it was by no means one to father and mother i cannot imagine why it was he came home and as father chooses to keep it secret i do not think it my place to speculate upon it it is certainly very strange willie looks quite badly his hair and beard are both very long which heightens the thinness of his face he has gone down to girard now to get mr baldwin to put a new stock to his gun left yesterday we expect him back tomorrow he had not reached the brigade before he was sick but improved steadily after he got into camp we all had a grand chinquapen hunt saturday went up to mrs phillips place took a basket of lunch and did not come back till afternoon the day was delightful and we enjoyed ourselves very much gathered a great many chinquapens we are having such beautiful weather now day after day the sun runs his bright course through a sky of cloudless blue and sets amid clear hues at evening only to give place to the moon and to charm us with soft brilliancy of venus which gleams like a jewel on the brow of evening the hickory trees alone show the approach of autumn by the slight russet hue of their outermost boughs the oaks are still brightly green though we have had one or two very slight frosts for several days we have had fire morning and evening but today it is very warm my windows are all open we have not omitted school one day since we commenced the children have never studied so well georgie commenced to learn to write today how earnest he was and how his little hand trembled how hard it must be for children to learn to write i have finished the first volume of my girondins am all impatience to get the next it closed just in such an interesting part i must send to mrs leighton for the other volume as soon as possible i was busy all yesterday evening in my little garden replanting my violets they have grown together so that many have died also set out a little heliotrope which i had rooted i forgot and left it in the sun this morning and was afraid my negligence had been fatal to it's delicate life but by taking it and carefully watering it i have brought to hold it's head up quite blithely was delighted yesterday evening by receiving a letter from mrs morancy the first in a long long time she had suffered dreadfully from sore eyes was quite blind for a time and had been dreadfully oppressed by melancholy afterwards my poor friend her life is indeed a darkened one how i wish she might find the anchor of an assured hope in christ this is the only balm for an aching heart like hers i must write to her now will spend no more time on this thursday oct 27th 1864 it has been more than two weeks since i wrote in my journal i have been watching for a leisure hour but have had none till this evening miss mary and i went in town a week ago last saturday to attend a rehearsal of the famous oft delayed tableaux spent the day at mrs stevens mary was not at home had gone up to see her uncle about john who is one of the conscripts lately ordered out he is extremely deaf and has the disease of the heart besides but has not succeeded in getting an exemption we met mrs willson for about five minutes in the morning and afterwards at the meeting i was very glad to see her she looks just as neat and pleasant and has as sweet a smile as ever though i fancied a few unknown wrinkles had planted themselves about her eyes and mouth she invited us to come out and spend the next week with her nothing was done about the tableaux that day but we made an appointment to come in the following wednesday and remain until after the tableaux on friday as we were going to town in the morning we met mr beck and miss mary on their way to homer for mrs barr we only saw them a moment as they were coming out of the flat when we returned home we found that willie had had a chill we came up stairs immediately to see him while i was up here dr furness and dr melton came in i had some curiosity to see the latter had been sick whenever he had come over before i dislike him extremely but i fear i am not quite justifiable in this as the only real cause i have for it is that he openly avows himself a reconstructionist he may be in other respects a good man but i cannot like one who cherishes these opinions the very word the very idea of reconstruction sends a thrill of horror and disgust through my veins oh what a shame to our principles what a wrong to those who have nobly fought and died for our cause and to the thousands of brave men now in arms to admit such an idea if our grievances were so great in time of peace that we could not bear them what hope of honourable union can we now have honourable union i scout the words there is none such there is only shame for us subjugation and national death in the idea of reconstruction i feel humbled when the word passes my lips poor willie had a chill again monday i had no school either monday or tuesday but was busy attending on willie and preparing to go to town tuesday on father's return from monroe he told us that he had met dr needlett at the ferry and that he told him mrs oliver was very dangerously ill mother and i went down that evening we found that she had been quite sick for several days previous her disease is that distressing affection of the bowels which prevails here so much i sat up with her part of the night it is such a solemn thing to sit up by the bedside of one who seems to lie between life and death the silent hours of the night passed swiftly away i employed them in all those deep involuntary thoughts which crowd upon us at such a time wednesday morning we went to monroe spent the day at mrs stevens mrs willson sent in for us that evening and we went out mrs copley accompanied us we found julia at home spent a very pleasant evening with her looking over some engravings and discussing tableaux in general and our tableaux in particular while mrs copley and capt pilcher had a tête à tête in the adjoining room this captain pilcher is a family connection of the willson's and is i think engaged to be married to julia i have not in a long time met with a gentleman i like so much his frank engaging manner and pleasant and intelligent conversation win the regard at once he is so perfectly polite without stiffness so easy and witty without the slightest familiarity and so gay without frivolity at the same time his clear forehead and pure soft eye bespeak a freedom from the vices which so often tarnish the character of our young men in truth julia has made a happy choice i hope she will marry him she both deserves and needs a good husband one to appreciate her sterling qualities and correct her faults i wish i could reckon capt pilcher among my friends but i have no idea that our acquaintance will ever progress our visit at mrs willson's was very delightful but quite short we spent both thursday and friday in town preparing for the tableaux dined both days with mrs judge bry mrs leighton's mother she is such a nice kind old lady and has such a funny old fashioned house and garden and oh such a beautiful little graveyard there are the gravestones of many of the family all covered with ivy and the large beautiful wild olive tress cast a solemn tremulous shadow over them we heard not a sound but our own hushed voices and the place was so shut in that we saw nothing but the quiet garden through the gate there was a great deal of hurry and confusion friday but at last everything was ready and really the tableaux were very pretty in one scene mary stevens looked so beautiful ordinarily she is a pretty girl but that night it delighted my eyes to look on her we were obliged to stay at the hall untill all the curtains and things were taken down and put away i then experienced that feeling described in hyperion in an empty theatre miss mary and eva stayed at mrs bry's that night with julia willson but mrs willson agnes and i went home it was late when we reached limerick and i was glad indeed to lay my wearied head upon the pillow i left mrs willson's soon after breakfast saturday morning and came into town spent a few hours very pleasantly with mary stevens and then went up to the trenton ferry where we found the flat just ready to leave and passing quickly over stepped into the carriage which was waiting on this side the evening was delightful and the roads good so that we felt in good spirits as we rolled on homeward after such a pleasant visit we found willie just up he had been sick ever since we left and mother said had missed us sorely he looks very pale and thin i hope so much that he will not be sick again his furlough is almost out and i want him to be well before he leaves home he got a fine mare yesterday swapped two mules and one old buggy for her she is not very large but a pretty form and dark bay color with a small head and spirited glance her stoutly formed limbs look like endurance was one of her qualities father is away now he left home last friday to take the railroad negroes out to texas it was this that he wished willie to come home for but willie was too sick to go father thought he could not any longer keep the railroad negroes here on his own responsibility and had no means of feeding and clothing them so he is going to carry them out to the iron works in texas he took a guard of soldiers with him but dismissed them the second day we were all astounded sunday evening by the apparition of father driving up we soon learned the cause of his coming eight of the negroes had run away and he had come back to offer a reward and take measures for their apprehension five of them have been caught thus far father went on immediately to millhaven and on his return on monday delayed only to get dinner and then went on again it was unexpected that the negroes should run away one of them was one in whom father placed great confidence and he had sacrificed so much time and care to them all that it sems very ungrateful i have been very busy all this week tuesday just as we were at dinner mrs barr electrified us by coming in with her baby in her arms we were so glad to see them mrs barr looks far from well and feels sad at the idea of leaving her husband unworthy as he is she feels a strong affection for him and shows it in her constant attention to him i thought miss mary too looked quietly sad she is very much devoted to mrs barr's baby we had quite a house full that night johnny stone came just before dark is come to take his sister home i went down to sit up with mrs oliver tuesday night came back in time to breakfast with them all and tell them goodbye they left immediately after breakfast mrs oliver is no better this is the third day that mother has been with her all day johnny and jimmy stone came to see us yesterday evening and stayed all night jimmy is such a nice boy i like him exceedingly in spite of his ugly face it is positively good looking when it is lighted up in conversation by honest good humour and sense johnny is as mrs staunton would say going through the puppy state we have a sick soldier here now his wife and her mother came here a little more than a week ago to stay all night he was very sick and at last they succeeded in getting him over here we were very sorry for his wife she stayed with him several days but was obliged to leave as she was very near her confinement her mother stayed with him several days but as he was improving and she was anxious about her daughter she left him yesterday his name is wallace he was one of dr furness patients but he did not like their moving him against his advice and gave him up dr bluebecker attends him now he comes over every day to see him mother says she thinks he is very kind to him he has consented that mr wallace shall go home as soon as he is strong enough major mason dined with mother saturday he was on his way to alexandria i should have liked to have seen him i am very tired this evening i have had a fatigueing day the children have been out of sorts this whole week eva was tired and excited by her visit to limerick and has scarcely recovered from it while loring was unfitted for study by his holiday i was very much tried by eva's sullen determined disobedience yesterday and by loring's inattention and passion today was obliged to make him learn several of his lessons over after dinner oh how hard it is to wait patiently to bear the cruel disappointment i feel on those days when they seem to have gone back and forgotten all i have striven to teach them but my experience is sometimes a day when i can see advancement and feel happy and then another to take away all my elation i must try and remember line upon line precept upon precept i must try at every opportunity to sow here a little and there a little good
saturday nov 2nd 1861 father left home a week ago last monday for new orleans we have missed him very much indeed this past week has been a very busy one with us mother has been making two or three winter dresses and altering some old ones i made a dress for myself this week it is only the second one i ever made i have been very busy sewing every day and this morning i worked too this evening i have been writing some letters mother is weaning john poor little fellow he does not cry much but looks so pale and pitiful he is fonder of mother than he was when she nursed him this evening a man his wife and child came here to know if they could stay tonight they had moved from mississippi and came out from monroe in a hack they had applied at several places for a night's lodging and had been refused mother could not turn them off she told them they could stay until monday last week we had delightful weather neither very warm nor cold the last day or two it has been really cold this morning there was a heavy frost on the ground poor willie had a chill last night he has been up all day today but looks badly monday nov 11th 61 father returned home last tuesday night and left for new orleans again this morning he went to monroe every day last week except one so that we had no pleasure of his society in this way we must expect to spend the winter willie had a chill last night he is almost discouraged and no wonder he has been having chills now since last summer john has been quite sick he still looks as white and fragile as a lily but his eyes are very black and shoot glances of fire at any one who crosses him he will not be petted by any one but mother i scarce dare to speak to him or look at him we all went to church yesterday morning heard a very excellent sermon though not a polished one one comparison struck me as particularly just and original in illustrating the providence of god the minister said god's providence may to likened to a very long chain which stretches from the creation of adam to the end of time to make you understand more clearly suppose i had a very long chain and should fasten one end of it on this earth and should hitch the end to the farthest off star that the best improved glasses have ever enabled man to discover and suppose that each link of that chain were so small that it could just be discerned by the natural eye and suppose you could only see one of those links at a time then you would see a far greater portion of that chain than any one man sees of god's providence during his whole lifetime was ever the most polished rhetoric more impressive than these energetic words mr pierce came over to see us in the afternoon he says he has not had a chill in more than two weeks willie prophesied that he would have one soon the weather is very warm while i write i am in a perspiration and this on the tenth of november the warm breezes are sending thousands of dead and dying leaves to the ground and it seems strange to look out on the brown woods a few days ago clad in gold color and crimson and now so changed but one thing remains steadfast the unchanging pine still rears it's dark green head withered neither by frost or heat aunt jane and miss mary stephens spent the day with us saturday i was glad to see them wednesday nov 13th i have been busy writing all day and feel quite tired but must write a few lines in my journal eva and i are quite alone this evening mother has gone to mrs axley's and the children are out gathering hickory nuts eva is almost sick with a cold misses joe and phoebe friend spent the afternoon with us yesterday carrie young and mrs cloud also called i received a letter from miss valeria yesterday she says angus has been very sick since leaving home it is still very warm friday nov 15th this is the fast day appointed by our president to pray for a continuance of those blessings which god has thus far bestowed upon us i could not go to church this morning as the church where meeting was held today is four or five miles distant and willie could not spare the mules for us to go i have not eaten any meat or butter however and having been reading newspapers and knitting socks all day truly we have reason to fast and pray for war now encompasses us on every side and though god has thus far enabled us to ward off our enemies yet we have much more to do ere we establish our independence on the 7th there was an attack made on our troops opposite columbus ken our force stationed there was very small and being overwhelmed by superior numbers retired to the river bank and awaited reinforcements these soon came and charging the enemy forced them to fly in confusion to their transports we gained a complete victory although their numbers were superior to ours a part of the great northern fleet attacked the south carolina coast on the 10th and took two of our batteries they also gained possession of the small town of beaufort and were expected to attack savannah but a large body of troops were ordered out to guard the city and the railroad guns were mounted and vessels sunk in the channels and it is thought that should they attempt a landing they could not fail of being repulsed east tennessee is reported to be in an insurrectionary state several railroad bridges have been burned and the country said to be in a state of great excitement the officers and crew of the privateer savannah have been tried and found guilty of piracy president davis will fulfill his threat of retaliation and the prisoners in our hands have drawn lots if our privateers are hung col corcoran of the united states army two capts and ten lieutenants will suffer the same ignominious death is it not horrible every day increases my abhorrence of lincoln and his parasites fremont is withdrawn from the command of the western department and hunter appointed great dissatisfaction is felt in the west and it is said that threats are made of appointing fremont military dictator of the west a military dictator in the united states a military dictator to rule over the race which produced a washington they are unworthy of the heritage of this name his hallowed birthplace owns not their rule henceforth washington the father of our country his memory his virtue his valor they remain the heritage alone of his native state and the fair sisters that with her form our youthful confederacy gen'l scott has resigned but with what different feelings do we hear it than we did five months since when every heart beat high with exaltation and every eye glanced proud welcome to the old soldier faithful to his native land when every virginian as they met each shook hands over the tidings and every church bell rang out a glad welcome but we were mistaken he was a traitor and he is now fallen below our indignation we look upon him with pitying contempt in all his pride of generalship he has succeeded in wounding only himself and as he has been able to do us no harm so his resignation can do us no good he has been careful in the terms of his with drawal from active service to proclaim still a friend to his country's foes and as such all must regard him a powerless friend an equally powerless foe nov 16th saturday father came home last night he is quite well he brought a letter from mrs aucorn a lady teacher in new orleans who applied to mother for a situation several weeks ago she wrote stating the branches she teaches so candidly and her situation too that mother and father concluded to take her she is married and has two children but her husband is in the army and his pay is insufficient for their support i am glad we have at last engaged a teacher i feel that after the desultory life i have been leading lately it will be hard for me to settle down to my studies but i feel that i am ignorant and i really want to learn then too the other children must have a teacher miss mary and eva are fast growing up and they scarcely know the elements of education the weather today is cool and cloudy a dense fog settled last night before dark and is just now clearing away father has just left for monroe tuesday nov 26th 61 my seventeenth birthday i cannot but think of my last birthday and the retrospection makes me sad how many changes have taken place since then how short the time seems and yet in that short time our infant confederacy has sprung up where are now the enemies who boasted that we should be hushed into quietness as easily as the mother hushes a fretful babe there is much very much to be thankful for why does my heart ever cry more but my birthday has been very pleasant and enlivened by an unexpected visitor yesterday morning lory came it and said that there was a buggy coming with a lady in black and a negro man in it we could not imagine who it could be the lady stopped at the gate and emmeline went down to see her she soon came up saying that it was a lady traveller who wished to stop eight or ten days mother exclaimed we cannot take her in our family is too large we are expecting a teacher and haven't any room go down and tell her i can't possibly take her show her the way over to mr adams so saying mother hurried out upon the piazza but what was her horror to see the buggy driving off and the lady traveller walking up to the house what could emmeline mean by letting the buggy go off who knows who she might be but when the lady arrived about half way up to the house i heard mother exclaim isn't that mrs horne and sure enough it was we were very glad to see her she and mr horne had just come to vicksburg to attend to some business and are going back to georgia to spend the winter major bry spent the day with us sunday and mrs bry and misses puss and hannah came over in the afternoon captain smith one of the directors in the railroad came down sunday night he went away this morning father has been trying again to buy mrs richardson's place he wrote up to capt smith to try and buy it for him but he could not succeed he is now going to try and buy five or six acres to put the house on it is not framed yet and father wants to move it over on the place we first selected that is if he can buy enough land to put kitchen and outhouses upon the weather is quite pleasant now it rained last night and has been a little cloudy today mrs marks is spending the day with us in honour of my birthday father and mr horne went into town today saturday nov 20th mr and mrs horne left us wednesday father and mother went into town with them i spent the day at mrs friend's wednesday and enjoyed it very well i had sent word that i was going but the boy did not carry the message and they were not expecting me they thought it was one of the children knocking and bade me come in very carelessly i was very much surprised at this but entered accordingly misses nancy neal joe and phoebe friend were sitting around a quilting frame their tongues keeping time to the motion of their needles all except miss nancy destitute of the expansive appendiges hoops they greeted me warmly however and we soon resumed the animated conversation which i had interrupted mr and mrs friend soon entered and inquiries about the health of our respective families having been exchanged i was asked if i know how to quilt i was obliged to confess my total ignorance of that female accomplishment at the same professing my desire to learn i was invited to take a seat at the quilting frame and immediately found to my great satisfaction that my quilting was unequaled in smallness of stitches and the accuracy of the lines by any of my companions though i must in candor say that while i was quilting one shell they had finished three i always like novelty and was very much pleased with my new accomplishment in the afternoon we walked over to see miss applewhite who with her mother mrs simmons lives very near the friends i found them at home and was soon on easy terms with mrs simmons whom i have met once or twice at the society she is a very neat pleasant lady and her daughter a modest pre possessing girl mrs simmons was carding cotton rolls my experience about carding lint had been very favourable and begging the use of her cards for a few moments i made half a dozen very good rolls with a little instruction from her the good lady was pleased to say that she had no doubt i could learn to spin in a very short time after staying about two hours we returned to mrs friend's and willie being there waiting for me we mounted our horses and came home here let me remark that it is no pleasure for me to ride railroad any more he is as lazy as he can be and stumbles nearly every step he nearly fell down with me wednesday father left us for new orleans thursday he will bring mrs aucoin back with him that is god willing willie had a chill thursday it was very slight however today is very pleasant considerably colder than it has been for several days mother and i went over to mrs drake's thursday mrs anding was over here this morning mr jones came down thursday took dave home with him i am reading woodstock aloud and miss mary is here begging me to go and read it to her so i must not write any longer
tuesday nov 4th a week ago today was willie's twenty first birthday he is now a man my dearest brother the companion of my childhood is a man how strange it seems i cannot think of his otherwise than as he has always been to me and yet his life of manhood is actually begun how may a few years change him i look with wonder on estranged families where sisters and brothers meet without recognizing each other and it seems as if they never could have been children together it seems to me as if i could never feel so to willie may god in mercy grant that he may never give no reason julia compton and her sister maggie spent yesterday with me the day passed very pleasantly we have a poor sick soldier here he came monday has two brothers with him the poor man was not well when he left home and has been in the hospital three months he is a perfect skeleton and could not walk up stairs but is anxious to get home and would have started today but it is threatening rain and mother thought he had better not go they are of the poorer class of people but are well clothed in complete suite of homespun the two well ones have very heavy dull intellects they seem to be good people but it is almost impossible to get them to say anything but yes and no mother says they are like all of the good country people are very shy especially among strangers oh how the wind blows i think it will rain i hope so for the dust is suffocating and the turnirps need rain very much what changes have taken place outdoors since a few days the oaks are all brown and the leaves of many trees are already falling such a frost as we had in october is seldom seen here so early but though the oaks are seared some of the other trees still preserve their bright red and yellow leaves and enliven the landscape it is so dark now that i must stop writing friday nov 7th two of those men i mentioned are gone but one not the very sick one is here still he was taken sick the night before his brothers left the doctor thinks he has typhoid fever his name is george woodard it appears that he left his company without a furlough only to be absent one day today an officer of his company came after him but went away again finding that he was sick he is going to send the sick man's brother to wait upon him the officer who came today amused us all a great deal by his conversation he said at dinner speaking of camp fare i used to think it was mighty hard living it i could not have just what i wanted but now i would walk half a mile for that potatoe then seeing us smile incredulously be continued yes i would and so would any of the boys if they tuk a notion for it poor soldiers i am sorry for them oh when will we have peace we have heard nothing from father since he left though it is now more than three weeks as the time for his coming draws nearer i become more and more impatient to see him tuesday nov 11th saturday morning we were very agreeably surprised by a visit from mrs bennett and her daughter they had been at monroe and were going home that evening so that they could not stay and dine with us the young ladies are coming down soon and promised to spend some time with me we had just sat down to dinner when emmeline came in to say that there was a carriage at the door with what looked like a sick soldier in it mother told willie to go and see and tell him we had a sick man here and could take no one after some minutes of impatience on our part we found that it was mr murrah with two other gentlemen we have but a slight acquaintance with.mr murrah as our only intercourse with him was one morning when father invited him to breakfast with us but he was then so easy and agreeable in conversation that we were all favourably impressed with him and were glad to have his company to dinner the other two gentlemen were refugees from new orleans one had been away some time but was obliged to leave his family there as he could not get a passport for them to come away the other gentleman had left new orleans but a few days before and gave us an interesting account of the proceedings there he says one must depend upon butler's caprice about getting a passport but that generally one can be bought for five hundred dollars though he has known a thousand to be given he says those persons who take the oath are not allowed to leave the city except to go to the united states he said that those negroe regiments the yankees have are more trouble than use to them they have to watch them closely to prevent their running back to their masters this soldier is still sick here the doctor came this morning pronounces his disease camp fever says he will probably recover soon the soldier's brother came and spent the day and night with him saturday but his regiment was ordered off and he could not stay it is very warm tonight we are all hoping for rain we are in great need of it willie left home yesterday to look up some pork we expect him back tonight we are reading prescott's conquest of mexico now commenced it last week we find it very entertaining saturday nov 15th this morning we were most delightfully surprised on waking up to father here at least we all were surprised except mother and willie who knew when he came miss mary and i jumped out of bed and dressed immediately though it was only a little past five and we could not see to tie our shoes we saw the sun rise this morning the sight was so beautiful that it seemed strange to me that i should content myself with seeing it only once or twice a year when i might see it every day father looks better than when he went away he was obliged to go into monroe this morning as he leaves us tuesday for richmond i cannot bear the thought of his being absent another week perhaps longer this poor soldier here is very ill indeed his wife came this morning he seems to know her but cannot speak to her lies and groans constantly it is pitiful to hear him one can hear him as soon as they approach the house and he sleeps very little i have been with him all day today and must go up again now monday nov 17th our poor soldier died saturday night and was buried sunday his widow is still here but will probably leave tonight poor woman i am very sorry for her mr horne spent sunday with us he looks very well indeed last night we had rain all night and today it has been so damp that we could not have school i have been very busy however reading french mending gloves marking socks writing letters for father to take with him and mending eva's doll it is one which she prized very highly john broke it yesterday and she sorrowed deeply over it but i think i can mend it.very well indeed with diamond cement father brought me such a beautiful present for my eighteenth birthday i feel almost guilty to have such a present now but it was a perfect surprise to me i had no idea of receiving any present at all much less such a beautiful one it is a rosewood dressing case handsomely inlaid with brass and fitted up inside with purple velvet and silk and everything one could want for dressing and travelling father also brought home with him a beautifully bound copy of humbolt's cosmos i anticipate great pleasure in reading but fear i shall not yet be able to understand it saturday nov 22 father left tuesday another month of waiting is before us now the small pox is at the camps several have died with it we are anxious to have the children vaccinated but cannot get any matter at last they have commenced burning the brick kiln it has now been burning two nights we have been out to see it each night it has been beautiful starlight and we have had an excellent opportunity of observing the stars the trees no longer interpose a leafy screen between us and the heavens nearly all of them are bare now this is a delightful day the sky is perfectly blue and the air warm but bracing as i sit here the perfumes of our heliotropes and geranium reaches me and through through the open window i hear the low sweet music of the pines how calmly beautiful the scene not the fresh bright spirit of spring it is true nor the glowing luxury of summer nor gayety of early autumn but the beauty of winter an indescribable a peculiar beauty when the spirit is calmed the passions seem to die in looking out on the shining naked landscape if i could only feel that my country was at peace what happiness would be mine yet i know not i am ever prone to murmur my wicked spirit must always have some trial to chasten it let me bear it then without murmuring sunday nov 30th 1862 my eighteenth birthday has come and gone i have now reached a period long looked forward for i am now a young lady i do not feel the weight of my new dignity much however yesterday i finished reading paradise lost and commenced cosmos what a sublime work paradise lost is and there are touches of exquisite beauty as well as grandeur i closed the book with a clearer conception of the divine scheme of redemption and a deeper love of christ in my heart i am anxious to read some in cosmos before father returns but i do not have a great deal of time for reading i received a letter from miss ginnie calwell last week she was on the eve of starting for n orleans said butler would allow ladies to go in and out now and that a great many are going down to attend to their husband's business she says anyone can bring goods out of the city by paying butler i want none of his goods and i should not trust myself to the whim of the brute butler as he is commonly called what sanctity can the publisher of his proclamation accord to the name of woman mother has gone into trenton this evening to see mrs cauthorn who was thought to be dying last week and is still very ill indeed she has a young baby i hope she may be spared for her children's sake we are having delightful weather now this morning it was very damp but has cleared off now and the wind is blowing the leaves in whirlpools around the yard we have had no war news for some time
monday nov 2nd 1863 it is now indeed winter though the weather is less wintry than we had last month true to it's character the first of november was chill and misty this morning it is very warm but cloudy willie came home saturday evening spent sunday with us he leaves again this morning we have hopes of getting the books and piano again soon mr gordon was here yesterday wanted to get some iron from father made an arrangement with him to bring our things it will be so pleasant to have them again we miss the books especially we had a frost friday night which killed the heliotropes out in the garden i cut them down and covered the roots the large one had such a thick stalk it was like a little tree tuesday nov 3rd i am at home today for the first time since we returned i feel the full thankful home feeling my beloved hillside speaks to my heart today for the first time and wakes a warm trembling throb of joy the old meaning which has lain asleep so long that i feared it was gone forever has wakened and once more everything looks familiar and dear there is my beloved pine standing clear against the deep blue sky there is the delicate tracery of the more distant oak tops and the little vista of brown trunks opening through a space between the sweet gum and the hickorys the young straight hickorys are indeed yellow with autumn leaves and many a sere one has fallen at their feet but what matter i shall see again spring's delicate buds i shall again watch spring expand into summer on this same hillside from this same western window if god wills and today i feel so humbly happy that it seems to me i can always bow to his will i know i shall not always be thus submissive but let me thank him for his grace while i enjoy when temptation comes i must pray miss mary has gone to her music lesson this morning and my little pupils finished their lessons early and learned them perfectly without a word of reproof this i know is the secret of my happy mood and the humility comes from a recollection of father's perhaps unmeant reproof it was good for me it touched a sore point i shall now look better into my heart and be more careful that i do no set myself up as better than others oh this warm bright sunshine the clear blue sky and the white clouds floating over it and through the open window comes the rustle of the leaves the hum of insects and the occasional chirp of the bird all those low bright sounds which come with the sunshine and the breeze of a warm autumn day with them comes in my heart a thousand ecstatic undefined thoughts and feelings it is in such hours as these that we realize what happiness may be it is then that we feel life life in its sense of full and perfect being not its varied cares and hopes and aims which are called forth by our social life life as the free existence of an individual ah the very consciousness of such a life is fraught with a sense of joyous freedom nature is well called our mother what a close delightful union exists between nature and human feeling nature always reaches my heart monday nov 9th i arose very early this morning about half past four o'clock was very sleepy at first and shuddered to leave the warm bed but i felt glad of it afterwards i had finished bathing and was dressed in my warm wrapper and had a quiet hour to myself when father called me to look at the moon the whole place was asleep and overhead the stars shone bright in the solemn morning heaven the moon a silver thread shone in the eastern horizon and high above glowed venus so brilliant yet mild in her beauty she was the fairest gem in the heavens but my heart gave a bound of joyous recognition as i walked into an open space between the trees and saw glorious old orion just before me what a beautiful constellation it is and being the first one i learned it seems like a familiar friend there too were all the well known winter constellations sirius and procyon and the pretty little triangle in argo novis were near orion in the south the sickle or leo glittered nearly on the meridian capella in the west and the twins and below them the pleiades and aldebaran while in the north casseiopeia was setting and the brilliant pointers showed the polestar hundreds of smaller stars were sowed over the heavens but venus was the queen of them all she glowed and brightened to the eye not like a star but resembling the moon in it's mild radiance i came in for a few minutes and than went out to watch the stars pale one by one and disappear till only sirius glimmered with scarcely distinguishable light and venus grew faint above the moon which seemed to dissolve in the rosy golden glow of the advancing dawn i thought of the lines friend after friend departs thus star by star declines till all are past away as morning higher and higher shines to pure and perfect day who can thus watch the fading stars without such thoughts the sadness and gloom faints before the triumphant brightness of the glorious king of day then the heart rejoices in the remembrance of the sun or righteousness which here we see only darkly but hereafter shall rise in dazzling brilliancy the winter sun rises late and i waited only to see the pyramidal glow diffuse itself over the whole heavens and to find myself growing cold and weary of my position i returned to the house with my heart full of the freshness of the morning and strengthened for the day before me when i again left my room for breakfast the red disc of the sun was just appearing behind the trees and i watched it until my eyes were so dazzled i could hardly see to read thompson's dawning and sunrise a scene so true and so beautiful it was wednesday i think that we were surprised by a visit from willie he came up with mr gordon who left on the stage that evening he went to turn his wagons back for our piano and books they will be here now in two or three weeks willie was back again friday night came to see mrs willson on business she has at last decided to go to texas will try to leave today we have bought all her stock and sold her two teams willie rode up yesterday just as we were going to breakfast spent the day with us was obliged to go back in the evening for mr duvall was away at mr putnam's we walked down to see mrs willson yesterday evening found them in the last stages of packing we know well what that is everything to do and the heart sick and head weary julia was busy at work looked very badly pale and hollow eyed mrs willson was suffering from a headache could scarcely open her eyes but was as amiable gentle voiced as ever with her yellow hair smooth and her mourning dress perfectly neat in its arrangement i feel so much for them they are to start this morning and must now be sick the sad hour the hour of our departure is present to me now its hard sorrow and its future of danger and uncertainty and yet now we are quiet at home again how unaccountable are the workings of feeling i grieved to leave home i grieved to return and now that i can once more feel the grateful joy of being at home i still sometimes regret with such intensity that we could not have continued our journey now and then there comes a vague unacknowledged wish for the strangeness the freedom the adventure of our unfinished journey or of any journey like it into an unknown land but this is only now and then i thank god for this peaceful asylum for all those dally cares and daily joys which little as they make up the sum of our life below to build to sow to plant and till that we may next year reap the fruit of our labours to watch the leaves fall with the hopeful thought that we shall see those same trees bud again these are pleasant things my daily duties are little things to teach line upon line some days to be cheered by the hope that i have benefited others to be cast down with the thought that my work is useless to endeavor to improve my own mind and my life and to succeed in learning how little an idea i have of the knowledge others have toiled to gain and to penetrate day by day deeper into my own heart drawing thence some little sparks of good to cheer me but seeing oh so much uncharitableness so much selfishness and ingratitude thus are my weeks and months chequered even amid their seeming monotony and i hope that i shall some day struggle into more strength greater purity i read yesterday in pilgrim's progress the parable of the two husbandmen one of whom sat down in dispair in his overgrown farm the other weeded the fields little by little every day removing a stone and at length his whole farm was clear and smiling with abundant harvests and then i turned to my little note book and read from thomas a kempis if every year we rooted out one fault we should soon become perfect men monday nov 16th the week that has past since i last wrote has been a long one and very eventful to us miss mary and loring went in town on monday and as eva was not very well we did not have any school mrs mays came to spend the day in the evening willie rode up accompanied by his substitute it is a hard word for me to write harder still for me to think of michael fry to his name from one of the border states of germany a strong stout man accustomed to exposure and hardship his price is ten thousand dollars in money a horse saddle and bridle and to provide a house and bread stuff for his family during his absence it is a high price to pay but a little one to receive when one is going to a life of peril and hardship only for the price the surgeon here expressed himself well pleased with the man but the papers had to go to some higher officer from whom they returned the other day with the endorsement no more substitutes received except in case of the sickness or disability of the party procuring them this is ridiculous for it is only those well qualified for the army that need a substitute col harrison said it was an assumption of power and advised father to write to kirby smith about it i sometimes think i have false ideas on this subject and that willie is perhaps doing his duty better by remaining to assist father who so much needs him than by going into the camp where he would not assist our country any more but still i cannot help feeling it as a stain a cause for blushing that he should have a substitute oh if we had only got to georgia but then a greater sorrow might have come upon us i ought to be resigned and yet i cannot be it seems to me i am getting more and more irritable and unhappy the children try me so much i could be happy if i thought i was doing them any good friday mother father and miss mary went to town and george had a chill so i had only lory and eva in school i tried to teach them with as much gentleness as possible but lory yawned and made faces and would not read and at last fell into a fearful passion i have never seen any one like him when he does so which he does quite often he raged and trembled and almost foamed i could not control him at all but at last succeeded in making him finish reading though i almost had to tear the words from his mouth i could not help being provoked with him it is so hard when i do all i can to be told that he hates to look at me and to hear me talk and wishes there was never a book written and that he would rather be dead than have to come up in that room with me every day after he got over his reading he did the rest very well and was in good humour before he left but i cannot improve him any while he is subject to such rages and when they went down stairs i was perfectly weak and lay down by little georgie to weep passionately i was so dissatisfied with myself and so sorry to have given way to my temper this morning again loring was so bad not only to me but to his sisters that i thought it my duty to tell mother though i did after a struggle i don't know what i ought to do i suppose he will hate me at last but it cannot be right for me to give him up to this terrible temper if he does not learn to control it he will be miserable through life mary stevens and mrs harrison her cousin dined with us friday they came by in the morning on their way to dr temple's to have mrs harrison's teeth worked on and did not get back to dinner till late their visit was so pleasant that it made me almost forget the morning but at night the recollection came back oh if i could be assured that i doing right that the end will be for good i could bear the present trial but sometimes i think it would be better for me to let loring alone altogether mr seale set out for arkansas on monday he is to buy flour and grain and salt for us dr mcdonough took tea with us thursday willie was also here it was the twenty third anniversary of father's and mother's wedding and also father's fiftieth birthday the weather is now cold and clear the ground is strewn with fallen leaves and those that still hang on the tress are brown and withered mr bowmar barr called wednesday and left a letter for me from mrs morancy it was affectionate but very sad they are still in homer but think of going to minden this morning we heard two volleys of shot probably over the graves of some of the dead soldiers the hospitals are nearly opposite one above one below us several have died since we returned dr mcdonough says mostly from imprudence after they are convalescent they came for our ambulance to send two home for burial poor fellows they have no comforts and few necessaries for the sick room the dr says he is ashamed of their hospital equipments it makes me sad sometimes to think how we have every comfort and are in health while just over the road men are dying or languishing with but a pallet to lie upon where they have no room to turn themselves and once they had no candles mother gave them some to light a poor man to death this courier we have here said yesterday a good many poor fellows over yonder are getting long furloughs long furloughs indeed and the saddest part is many of them are not going home wednesday nov 18th mr gordon came back last night but i suppose it will be a week before the wagons arrive i am getting on a little better in school yesterday miss mary went to her music lesson but the others were in school and did very well indeed george took quinine and missed his chill he has had but three and yet he looks pale and thinner already father went on a shopping excursion yesterday bought a piece of very pretty plaid linsey for twelve dollars a yard and some other woolen stuff for seven he brought home a piece of bleached cotton for mother to look at it is coarse and very thin price nine dollars per yard the cheapest thing was a paper of needles only a dollar and a half thursday nov 26th 1863 my nineteenth birthday it is evening and that quiet hour when all are gathered in the parlour and no sound is heard except the crackling of my fire which throws its cheerful light all over the walls and furniture a pleasant scene inside but out of doors the dreary november evening is fading into night i feel sad and many thoughts stir in my breast as i think of the past year ah if i could i would not write the retrospect here many trials there have been it has been the most eventful period of my life and probably will remain so but it is not for me to consider what i have felt but how i have improved the gifts of providence for trials are gifts as well as joys and to me more beneficial ones i hope tremblingly that i may have grown stronger more perfect in the faith which is life's greatest blessing but i feel within me the need of far far greater strength in looking into my heart today i see many prevailing errours of life and thought and there are others thrown into the shade i know i feel every day every hour how weak my own resolves are unless my god supports me but with all these thoughts mingle those of the dead and the absent i yearn for my friend my valeria if i could write to her if i could once more see her familiar writing even if i knew where she is i pray constantly that i may meet her again sometimes i fear that if this is permitted it may be years hence and our youth is slipping away it is an unworthy thought that she should change in aught but to grow better but i need her so much now i can scarcely bear to look forward to meeting so long from now i spent a few days in town last week with mary stevens went in thursday and came out sunday it seemed so strange to be at leisure and free from plans as to how i should apportion my day i enjoyed my visit it was very quiet and somewhat sad mrs stevens was not well and i spent most of my time with may she was kind and gentle but the shadow on her is dark and heavy poor mary how every hope seems to have been removed it seems to me she must live amidst sad memories and she does in a measure but not as i would she is an excellent disposition i met a neice of mr stevens who is visiting them mrs tucker a widow and in very delicate health her two little girls were with her eva commenced taking music lessons today from mrs delary she is quite delighted to commence and seems anxious to improve i think she has musical taste sunday when i came home i found that our books and piano had come monday as soon as school was over we commenced to unpack them i spent that evening and the next in arranging them upon the shelves in the parlour where i thought a few months ago i should never see them stand father put up the shelves and fixed a lock on the door and we laid down a small carpet and arranged the furniture so that now our parlour is very comfortable and pleasant looking something better than luxury pervades it yesterday evening father took the piano apart it was very much out of tune and he tried to screw it up but in doing so broke a string fortunately it snapped near where it was fastened and by unwinding the other end father made it as good as new we did not dare to screw it any more for fear of breaking some more strings and we concluded something else must be the matter so by dint of much examination and gentle pushing and pulling father took out the board to which the hammers are attached dusted it thoroughly and put it back without producing any effect at last miss mary observed that the short sharp sound was caused by the fact that the hammer did not fall properly but remained in contact with the string thus preventing it's vibration miss mary and father at length discovered the screw which left the lever under the hammer in place and to our great exultation we screwed them all till the hammers sunk properly and although there is still something else needed the piano is now in very tolerable tune so much better than it was before that we are quite charmed my little charges have done quite well in school this week yesterday morning i was at the chest getting out some statuettes for the étagère when lory came to me with a petition i knew by his face before he spoke it commenced sister sarah if i ask you something will you tell me yes i said i must know what it was first it was that he and george might go to limerick with uncle jim who was going out to get some strawberry plants i said i could not for miss mary and eva were going away today and that would be two days out of the week but he promised so earnestly to study his lessons today if i would let him go that i consented and he ran off to get mother's consent he and george were highly delighted had a great deal to tell about brother willie when they came back and brought a curious ear of corn from him it is eight ears in one small of course but making a large group lying close and each separate ear quite full loring was true to his promise said his lessons well this morning we have had quite cold weather for several days this morning it was freezing cold and quite clear but grew dark and cloudy towards night mrs seale spent the day with us i finished mother's gloves today have not knit them to fit very well spent the evening in sewing on some buckskin gloves which father is experimenting on have not read much since i returned from town i fear i shall not finish cosmos this year as i hoped yesterday evening i read lamartine's description of a view of constantinople from pera the description is beautiful so melodious so graceful it gave me great pleasure a pleasure such as he himself describes calme et contemplatif not very calm either though free from such disturbing emotion as we have in other pleasures a beautiful description a fine sentiment elevates me to enthusiasm carries me away from the common minute realities of life onto those exalted heights which are not less real since they belong to the spirit world which shall endure forever i am reading little dorrit aloud i do not like it very much my interest in it already begins to flag though i am as yet only a quarter through the wearying phraseology of the characters the constant recurring portraitures produce somewhat of the effect of repetition in my mind dickens cannot compare with scott saturday evening nov 28th oh how cold it is i am very cold though sitting on the rug with my ink down on the hearth a position i have taken both for the warmth and for the firelight miss mary and eva went in to their lesson today though it was cold and rainy i sent may stevens a heliotrope cutting and some books she sent me out a root of the crown imperial when i was in monroe we rode up to limerick and got some of these and some hyacinths she sent me the hyacinths the other day after being cloudy and wet all day the sun came out brightly this evening and the glow of its crimson setting still lingers in the west yesterday morning we were all joyfully excited by mollie's arrival capt justice's little son rode her home she does not limp at all but is a little stiff in her shoulder which capt justice thinks she will never recover from i must take a ride the first fair day mr j gordon left for texas yesterday a new courier a mr flowers came here the other day wednesday we have now two mr bilberry and mr flowers for a time we had only one the second one who came was very anxious to go home as he had a large family and had left his affairs somewhat unsettled father used his influence to get him a furlough and he has been absent eight days he promised to bring miss mary and i some flowers on his return entirely of his own accord father has decided to take mrs willson's place limerick and willie is there now we expect him home tonight major bry returned from houston the other day with some goods brought some calico for us at five dollars a yard sevenpence in peace times he did not get any shoes they were seventy five dollars a pair dr calderwood returned from vicksburg yesterday brought out some goods very nice shoes at five dollars a pair i should not be willing thus to enter into trade with the yankees it does not seem loyal and right to me they have to buy with specie or yankee paper issue of course these calicos we have were brought from the north i suppose too but then we did not bring them thence i have been busy all day sewing eva's palmetto hat but could not quite finish it before dark i don't think these hats are very pretty for girls but they are quite serviceable and are all we have this one does not quite suit me in shape although i tried hard to make it like mine
thursday nov 3rd tuesday after we had been at school a few hours one of the children at the window called out there is miss kate stone i looked out and sure enough she was there and lucy seale with her of course we could have no more school kate was on her way to texas lucy stayed until wednesday morning she is so hard to entertain seems restless and dull all the time and never manifests animation on any topic of conversation except that of the beaus the day was a true november day rainy and dark in fact we have had nothing but clouds and dampness for the past week today it has not rained and has become much colder kate left this morning i am afraid she will have a hard trip the roads are so bad father and willie left tuesday morning for vienna from there willie is going on to texas with the runaway negroes poor fellow he will have anything but an agreeable trip especially in this weather i am very much afraid he will be sick again father returned from vienna last night father has had my little garden so such enlarged it is now twice it's former size we have been attempting to lay it out this evening but have made but slow progress wednesday nov 9th 1864 yesterday was a day which will be ever memorable on this continent the election day in the united states what a struggle it must have been we cannot hear the result for some time we shall wait with great anxiety there is probably more solicitude about this election in the south and more excitement in the north than in the one of four years ago i have been very busy in my little garden planting some violets and hyacinths we have laid out half of it in beds and i think it will look quite pretty it is a great pleasure to work in it rests my mind a great deal but is very tiresome to the body my shoulders ache me badly but this is nothing nothing to the trouble and anxiety and weariness of my mind this morning sometimes i feel as if i am doing no good to the children oh if i could only be more patient if i could only subdue my nervous irritability i am so much to blame i should have learned better self control but the children hurt me so loring and eva by their disregard of my feelings by their want of love which they show very often when i correct them ever so mildly and that irritates me and makes the matter worse instead of mending it i have resolved and resolved over and over again but it is so hard to see the point of severity to which my duty should make me go god help me i pray i am too weak and sinful to aught alone a mr vandenberg whom i met in monroe not long ago came here saturday to tune my piano it is quite improved though it does not sound as sweet as i had hoped it would i suppose that is the fault of the instrument not the tuner miss mary and eva have commenced to practice again i have been so busy with school and my garden lately that i have had little time to read in my girondists am very much afraid i shall not be able to finish it this month we have not yet finished david copperfield are in the most exciting part of it now though to me the book is not exciting it may be because i have read it before but i think not it is too deeply pathetic to be exciting the weather has for a day or two been very cloudy and as warm as summer but it has cleared off pleasantly cool this evening dr furness was over sunday night says he thinks mrs oliver in a very critical situation i do indeed hope she will recover i have had the pleasure of seeing dr bluebecker lately he spent the evening with us about two weeks ago i like him tolerably i think would like him better but that he has such a peculiarly weak thin voice which strikes one unfavourably i think a great deal of character is manifested in the tones of voice dr melton came over about a week ago with capt oliver's brother i liked dr m no better than at first though his conversation was more pleasing not being on political matters tuesday nov 15th 1864 this is georgie's seventh birthday how fast the children are growing up it does not seem like seven years since we left georgia but it seems as if we had been here such a long time our old home and all the associations of my childhood are like a dream we have holiday today in georgie's honour and i have been writing letters all the morning it is a murky chilly day peculiarly suited to letter writing but now that my correspondence is so irregular and uncertain i do not take that lively interest in writing that i used to we have had such delightful clear warm weather lately so unlike november i have spent almost every afternoon in my flower garden which is beginning to assume a somewhat orderly appearance i was in the garden saturday when i was delighted by a visit from mary stevens and eliza baker we spent a very pleasant day what made it doubly pleasant was that it was father's birthday and the anniversary of his and mother's wedding they have been married twenty four years i like miss eliza baker very much indeed she is only sixteen and is quite girlish and unaffected miss mary rode with them about a mile on their way home and enjoyed it very much as we also did the walk back in the clear quiet evening light father received a note from willie dated a week ago sunday at shreveport he was quite well and had carried all the negroes that far quite safely i received a letter from grandma and lois last week it was written in july they were quite well also received one from julia compton she had been sick but was then better saturday nov 19th the day is dark and cold it has been rainy since wednesday evening yesterday we had a very hard rain but today it seems preparing to turn to one of those cold cold seasons which at this time of the year generally follow a long rain the wet ground and the gloomy sky confine us indoors and i have spent time since breakfast engrossed in the bloody annals of the reign of terror and pitying the unhappy fate of marie antoinette and her royal children i feel very quietly happy today notwithstanding the book i have just left for willie is at home again the same dear kind brother with his soft voice and smile we were delightfully surprised by his coming thursday evening for we had not expected him until today at the soonest we were all so glad to see him john was down at mrs lidwell's with mother he delighted to see his brother widdy it was quite dark in the parlour when they first came but as soon as we went to the supper table john exclaimed he has had his whiskers shaved off willie had his long hair cut in shreveport and his moustache shaved and it does alter him a great deal he came through homer on his way back and saw mrs barr's and mrs bennett's family they were quite well it is so pleasant these nights so gloomy out of doors to gather our reunited home circle about the fire we have such a feeling of tranquillity of sympathy and security it is like the magnetic circuit my own private cares and troubles are not less but i trust the example of agnes in david copperfield has done me good to me there is nothing in life more worthy of striving for than a complete renunciation of self nothing more beautiful than a steady constant cheerfullness my continually felt feebleness the high and selfish passions constantly rising within me forbid me to hope that i shall ever attain this but that it is beyond my reach does not make it less my duty less my desire to endeavour to come as near my saviour's example as he in his mercy shall permit to me i do not think i should be selfishly romantic and ridiculous if i were to think that in my peaceful home life surrounded by all these dear ones i have any cares and sorrows to compare with those of millions of fellow creatures it is only my undisciplined heart only my too anxious desire that these dear children should improve and should love me only my trouble and fear for my beloved country that i pray god to help me to bear with cheerfulness as we all need his help in our little daily troubles as well as in our heavier trials oh how compassionate is he who in abundant love has numbered all the hairs of our heads my little garden is at last all laid out and digged up i wait now for spring to bring her soft airs and robe it in gaiety and beauty i received a note from mrs morancy the other day saying that her mother would expect miss mary and eva after the christmas holidays i am so glad they can go i hope and think they will improve there more than with me wednesday nov 23rd 1864 i feel very sad and troubled what i have long feared has come i have been obliged to stop teaching eva i don't know whether i am right or wrong that is whether my proceeding will have a good effect or not i don't see how i could do otherwise there has not a day passed for the last week that she has not been insulting in her behaviour to me on no provocation at all and it has tried me very much yesterday i prayed as usual to be kept from my own passion and went into school determined to do right and if possible to avoid eva's anger at first i hoped i should succeed but i soon found that she was out of temper about her geranium which had nearly frozen the night before i had gone up into the school room early in the morning while she was up there and had poured cold water around one which i thought was the best thing to do she showed nothing but good humour then but soon after we commenced school she said the water would kill them i said i had done what i thought best eva kept increasing her irritation more and more but i tried not to notice it and said nothing but when i came to hear her geography i think it was she flew into a violent passion and used very abusive language to me i was so much agitated that i have quite forgot what it was loring had been troubling me that morning and i was quite weary of this oft recurring abuse of me when i do all i can for them i was very indignant and i told eva i would not teach her any longer unless she would apologize for her behaviour and promise not to repeat it she did this but in an extremely reluctant and sullen manner which increased the resentment i felt all the rest of the morning she continued to annoy me in every possible manner george too was violent and disobedient this hurt me more than anything else my feeling for him is tenderer than for any of the others and his unkindness hurts me more i was suffering from eva's conduct and when he spoke so my self command gave way i made some incoherent exclamation about how they troubled and burst into a passion of tears i know this was not right nor proper but my passionate nature when it does burst forth is so violent i recovered my self command before george finished his lesson but when i came downstairs my eyes were yet reddened and my face troubled after dinner i could no longer command myself i came off into my room and it seemed to me as if my heart would break all my exertions seemed useless all my prayers unanswered after awhile i went back into the dining room and thought my emotion unnoticed untill mother asked me what was the matter and if the children were troubling me i said not more than usual but she asked if it was eva and i said yes and added with tears that i didn't believe she cared anything for me father said i had better stop teaching the children this hurt me worse than ever it seemed a confirmation of my fears that i was doing them no good i sat at work for some time without anything more being said i was very busy making some gloves for willie i meant to ask mother not to say anything to eva about it but before father's going out had given me an opportunity i did not like to speak before him eva came in and mother told her she had better not go to school any more until she went to homer if she could not behave herself properly eva has not spoken to me since nor i to her i cannot bear to seem to beg for that affection to which i have forfeited no right if i had done wrong i would ask her pardon but i have not i think if i thought she desired it i would make advances to her but she seems so coldly sullen to me that i cannot do it and yet it seems to me i am hard hearted and wrong to continue in coldness which i am far from feeling if eva would only love but i don't think she does i could not be more unkind to an enemy than she is to me she does not know how it hurts me i am afraid if she perseveres thus i shall lose that love for her which i now feel this is such a bright beautiful day the landscape is all bright and glittering in the cold sunlight many of the trees have lost all their leaves since monday the weather cleared sunday evening and has been brightly cold ever since this morning it froze in our room my geranium is warmly covered i have been afraid to open it lest the cold should get in but i don't think it is frozen our plants upstairs are only slightly hurt the little tender heliotrope is killed jimmy stone called to see us sunday afternoon as he was on his way to trenton with the regiment he had had a hard trip to and from alexandria their horses were for five days without food or grazing many died jimmy's two took the distemper and were perfect bags of bones they had come up from alexandria through all the mud and rain of last week with the horses in this condition it seems an inexplicable move this trip to alexandria they did not do a thing but ruin their horses jimmy says the soldiers are deserting terribly at alexandria there were fourteen shot in a week this is appalling many of them are the paroled vicksburg prisoners who have been spoilt by staying at home too long dr furness came over sunday evening to bid us goodbye was ordered down to alexandria left yesterday morning monday nov 28th 1864 willie left us again this morning for his command which is now camped at oak ridge he is now quite well and strong again and i hope so much that he will continue so the dearest kindest of brothers we miss him so much saturday was my twentieth birthday it seems so strange to think i am twenty when i was a little girl i thought twenty was so old as willie was home and was going to leave so soon we asked mary stevens to spend the day with us and drs walton and talbot to dine dr bluebecker is quite sick mary did not come but the doctors did dr talbot has recently come to take charge of the hospital he is quite handsome not very large or manly looking but slight with a delicate complexion clear forehead dark soft blue eyes and a beautiful curling brown beard he is so pleasant to look at that one can excuse his silence and coolness especially as gives him an air of superior wisdom maybe thats why he talks so little the weather is now quite summerlike again but alas it has come too late for my poor dear geranium the frost killed all the outer branches of it and though the main stalk is living i think it would be prettier to cut it down and let it sprout up again next spring willie and i went to church yesterday morning the first time in my life i ever went to church on horseback i rode willie's mare flora coming home willie proposed a gallop up the hill in front of the house oh it was so delightful such a strong rapid motion it will be a long time before i enjoy such a one again we heard saturday of the reelection of lincoln it is true beyond a doubt oh how could the yankees be so lost to all self respect and love of freedom as to reelect that man with a full knowledge of all his crimes against liberty and justice nothing remains for us now but to fight bravely they have clearly shown that no regard for our rights or theirs will weigh against their mad infatuation for conquest there is one consolation in this disappointment to me that is that no one now can entertain the least lingering desire for reconstruction no one at least who has any love or pride for his country reunion with a people tamely taking to themselves the shameful domination of a lincoln no never
saturday dec 7th 61 father returned last night but did not bring mrs aucoin with him one of her children was taken very sick and of course she could not leave it she wrote saying that she thought perhaps it's sickness had been sent as a warning to her not to leave her children while father was in the city he went to see a miss hokerno a jewess who once taught in major bry's family she is an excellent teacher but her salary is one thousand dollars wednesday was society day we went but there were but ten members present mother and i spent thursday with mrs marks mr pierce spent sunday with us mother miss mary willie and john expect to leave for amite monday this evening we had a very hard rain but not of very long duration it is still cloudy miss mary eva lory and i went up to mrs britt's yesterday afternoon to got some yarn which her daughters were spinning for mother it is about a mile and a half from here and the road is through the woods all the way nearly just after we left the public road and were walking in a little path through the woods we saw a large black snake lying before us just accross the path we had nearly stepped on it when miss mary saw it and we all screamed and ran back to the road after we had run a few steps we heard a gun fire behind us but were too much frightened to stop mr drake's negro boy happened to be passing the road with a wagon and we called to him to come and kill it we went back to show him where it was but we found that the gun we heard was mr drake's he happened to be hunting in the neighborhood of our path he heard us scream and coming to the place saw the snake shot at it and wounded it very badly it managed to crawl to it's hole we were very much relieved and went on but not as gayly as before the children imagined that every leaf they stepped on would turn into a snake miss mary and i tried to spin some at mrs britt's and succeeded tolerably well considering it was the first time mrs britt showed us some very nice cloth which she had woven she also gave us two fine sweet potatoes apiece to bring home with us every one of her children had on homespun dresses father has received a letter from captain smith mrs richardson will not sell us the land monday dec 9th 61 they have all gone they left just after dinner poor little georgie he told mother goodbye very courageously but when he saw her get into the carriage he hid his face in my dress and could not help shedding a few tears these however were dried before mother drove off by the promise of some molasses candy with pe corns in it even father has gone he was obliged to go to desoto one day this week and thought he had better go with mother so the children and i will be all alone tonight how much i shall miss them two whole weeks but i shall have so much to think of that the time will pass more quickly tuesday dec 17th one week has passed since mother left and though each day has gone so quickly that i was not able to finish all i wished yet it seems a long time since she went father has been raising the house for a week past and i have been up to the place one every day except one besides this i have rose and little jim to keep at work and my anxiety for the children keeps me constantly looking after them i have had company too misses puss and hannah day spent saturday with me and miss puss remained all night so i had to do the honors of the house to them i enjoyed their company very well then sunday morning father was very much fatigued and after miss puss left he lay down on the couch and took a good nap i brought lory and george in the parlour and was amusing them by showing them some pictures eva was looking out of the window and she interrupted us by saying who is that at the same time i heard a man's step in the hall i did not rise thinking that it was mr pierce but eva who had gone to the door startled me by exclaiming captain no mr but before she had added the name i was at the door when to my perfect surprise who should i see but mr john green surprised though i was for no one was further from my thoughts i did not feel any more flurried than if he had come by appointment i awoke father out of his sound sleep and before his eyes were well open mr green had grasped his hand and father exclaimed mr john green i am glad to see you here sir mr pierce entered a moment after and the conversation never flagged a moment till dinner now dinner is too important a matter with a young house keeper to be passed over slightingly and let me here confess that i should not have been near so well pleased with mr john green's visit if i had not recollected that i had chicken for dinner was i not profoundly grateful that when deliberating in the morning upon the subject of economising and eating cow peas i had thought to myself and said to alice you know mr pierce might come to dinner today and i should hate to have no dinner notwithstanding that i had the rare luxury of chicken for dinner i could not help being very anxious lest everything should not be nice well i sat down at the head of the table and could not help smiling as i did so though i have occupied the place of mistress of the house too often to feel much embarrassed in my position i was helped to chicken and it seemed to me that it was very insipid i was afraid that alice had made a mistake and my company would not relish their dinner i knew that mr pierce seldom eats more than sufficient for a bird to live on so i turned my attention to mr john green and while i listened or replied to some remark my eyes were more interested in observing the contents of his plate than in marking the lineaments of his face but i had no cause for apprehension on this score as he helped himself to gravy and rice he observed miss sarah camp life has not taken away my appetite i might have answered that i perceived it had not and moreover i might have added that i was heartily glad of it but as may be conjectured i made some other reply he looks very well indeed i can scarcely believe that he has been through such hardships he treated them very lightly and spoke of them only in answer to questions he said that it was true he had suffered one night when he was on top of a mountain with no blanket just after a snow storm i should think so indeed the battalion to which the blues and the madison infantry belong is now in richmond forming into a regiment it is reported here that they have gone into winter quarters mrs marks leaves for georgia thursday i am sorry she is going she is an excellent neighbor father will accompany her as far as canton so i shall have to spend two more nights alone we received a letter from mother last night willie has not had but one chill since he left mother says he is enjoying himself i do hope this trip will improve him the weather is delightful has been ever since mother left last wednesday we had a slight rain and it turned very cold it is warmer now father went to bed an hour ago and i should have been asleep ere this but my multifarious duties leave me no time for writing in the day and thought i could not let my journal go any longer tuesday dec 31st 1861 i have neglected to write in my journal for some time but on the last day of the old year i feel that i must write mother miss mary and john returned home friday night the 20th a little more than a week ago willie did not return until sunday night he has only had one chill since he came home and that was on the same night caused from riding in the cold air mrs brantley and her son green came down here a week ago sunday 22nd the old lady came to see father on business we had a very pleasant christmas the day after christmas day miss mary and i fixed up a little pine tree as a christmas tree we had no costly gifts but a few sugar plums in lace bags and some home made cornucopias with two or three little wax candles made the tree very attractive to the children father had a few fire works too which he had forgot to bring home christmas eve and we were delighted looking at them the negroes had a supper and dance up at the place and we all walked up to see them father was very much pleased to see them dance and as their house was small and smoky so that we could not look on with any pleasure father had our long room cleared out and had them go in there and dance we stayed looking at them till nine o'clock and then walked home again mr pierce took all his meals here after christmas until sunday when he went back to the mill again mother received a letter from aunt mary last week saying that she thought something of coming out this winter aunt jane has a little daughter born on the 16th of the month mother eva and i went into monroe yesterday called at mrs steven's mrs noble's and mrs roane's and dined at major bry's passed a very pleasant day aunt jane looks very well talks about the baby very naturally father left for vicksburg yesterday mrs marks left for georgia the on the 19th george has been quite sick with a cold is getting better now john has gotten very well the weather is still delightful old mrs adams and mrs temple are here i must really go in the parlour it is the first time mrs adams has ever been here
tuesday dec 9th 1862 the small pox is really in monroe there are now four cases there not soldiers but in private families we have at last succeeded in getting some vaccine matter two returned soldiers stopped here last tuesday night one of whom had been vaccinated and still had the matter in his arm the next morning he vaccinated george joe and little jim but george's has not yet taken dr young will vaccinate his children from this mrs byrne was to come out to dr young's tonight the small pox was next door to them in monroe i do not think it is at all right for them to go to the doctor's as they could easily have hired a summer house somewhere in this neighborhood willie is not at home now he left sunday to go about sixty miles from here into arkansas to try and get some hogs i hope he will succeed it is very difficult to get meat at any price here pork is twenty five cents and bacon impossible to get the last was bought at fifty cents we expect willie back tomorrow or next day we heard from father sunday he telegraphed from richmond to mr mcguire to call a meeting of the directors to elect a president for this road in his stead so i suppose he has accepted the situation i am sorry and yet i am glad for i know he can do a great deal of good for the country and i feel that we ought not to think of ourselves it will be hard to be separated from him saturday evening julia compton and miss lucy seale came down to see me julia invited me to go home and spend the night with her i went and enjoyed myself very well became acquainted with mrs compton and miss mary and learned how to plait palmetto for hats maggie was plaiting some for a hat for one of the negroes the weather is delightful now it rained all the first part of last week but has been clear ever since thursday i commenced cosmos a week ago saturday but have only had time to finish the introduction yet wednesday night 11th of dec 1862 we have our first fire in our room tonight how pleasant it is to feel the grateful warmth and see the homelike light on the walls we have some more poor people here tonight a young soldier who was taken sick in the swamp his father came for him and was himself attached with inflammatory rheumatism lastly the mother left her young children and came down for them hearing of the small pox in monroe they left immediately though the son is very weak and the father not able to be taken out of the carriage the young man was carried upstairs but the poor woman was obliged to stay out at the carriage with her husband oh this terrible war thursday dec 18th since i wrote last we have heard again from father mother received a letter from him last saturday he has really accepted the position offered him as chief of all the railroads in our confederacy with the title of assistant adjutant gen'l and with the rank of colonel he says that it is the opinion of the secretary of war that it will be necessary for his to have a separate bureau i grieve to have father separated from us but am willing to submit to this if he can benefit our country and i know he can do it i feel no selfish pride in his elevation to such a conspicuous and important position though i feel a worthy pride in my father when i reflect on the change which his own intellect industry and energy have produced since he set his foot on georgia soil a youth of twenty with no fortune but his trade a half dollar and a few changes of clothes and his own genius and will now he can protect and aid the country which has been his foster mother father writes that it he establishes his headquarters in richmond he should like to have me spend several months there i should like to go very much on some accounts but yet i wish to remain at home we hope to see father the first of next week all the children were vaccinated sunday morning also some from the neighborhood the matter was taken from the arms of joe and george we had such an amusing traveller here the other night he was a perfect fool i have read of such characters but never met one before he kept us all in a constant agony of suppressed laughter he said he was sometimes afraid that the prophecies of isaiah would now be accomplished from the simple fact that the masculine gender would be almost extinguished by this war how ridiculous dec 25th 1862 christmas night it has been a sad christmas day to us father was not here we received a dispatch tuesday night saying that he must return to richmond before coming home it was a great disappointment since we had at least hoped that he would arrive christmas eve today has seemed just like sunday while at dinner we received some papers one of which contained a list of the wounded among them was a capt green i am sure it must be mr robt green for he was at fredericksburg and was in the 21st regiment mother and i went to see a new neighbour a family from the swamp who have rented mr richardson's place just opposite their name is dawson there are three young ladies in the family we only saw the eldest she is quite pretty pleasant and of a fashionable appearance mrs wheatly was married tuesday night to mr mays the soldier whom she has nursed so long there was no one invited as the bridegroom was too lame to stand and did not wish to have any company friday dec 26th our turn has come at last we heard this morning that the yankees had come as far as delhi on the railroad burning everything in their track and coming four miles an hour we know nothing of their force all suppose that they are coming to monroe i do not know whether our few troops will resist or not willie is gone in at full speed to ascertain the of the matter and to bring back our teams which went in this morning for corn oh if father was here i am determined come what may never to renounce my country but what is before us the negroes are busy barbecueing and cooking for their party tonight they may have to start away before day but we shall let enjoy themselves while they can night willie returned this evening bringing us no further news mr mcguire thinks that the yankees have e'er this gone back to their gunboats it is true that they laid delhi in ashes general blanchard has ordered all the men under forty five to meet at cotton post tomorrow morning early he purposes to make a stand at monroe i hope he will we have been watching the negroes dancing for the last two hours mother had the partition taken down in our old house so that they have quite a long ball room we can sit on the piazza and look into it i hear now the sounds of fiddle tambourine and bones mingled with the shuffling and pounding of feet mr axley is fiddling for them they are having a merry time thoughtless creatures they think not of the morrow i am sad very sad tonight last christmas father watched their dancing with us where is he now where shall we all be next christmas and tomorrow willie must go perhaps to battle i do not feel a single complaint in my heart but i am very sad monday dec 28th willie went to monroe saturday and brought back humiliating but still welcome news compared to what we expected there were only fifty five yankees who came to delhi burned the railroad warehouse and several other buildings together with a car containing a quantity of cloth for the soldiers they also burned several important bridges so that the cars cannot now run further then delhi about half way to vicksburg and all this damage done by a few contemptible yankees while our own contemptible general blanchard was shivering with fright in monroe and there was a whole company of our soldiers in the but they happened to be watching the wrong place if we only had a man for a general instead of the effeminate creature we have these raids might be prevented and this important railroad left open for the benefit of the whole country mr murrah dined with us yesterday he was on his way to mississippi but was stopped by this yankee demolition of the railroad and will be obliged to travel from delhi to the river on horseback we have not yet heard from father
friday dec 4th i took my first ride on mollie tuesday evening father and i rode down to the mill through the woods in other times our favourite and almost daily ride we had a very pleasant one on tuesday mollie did not go lame at all she actually bounded beneath me in her old wild free way i enjoyed my ride very much it had been nearly two years since father and i rode together i was busy wednesday evening in the garden with uncle jim setting out roses and other things i set a cutting of a climbing rose which willie brought me from arcadia before my window and a honeysuckle and lady banks in front of the house we put stakes around them and i think they will grow i was very intently superintending the planting of my roses when dr mcdonough came up he took me quite by surprise but i was very glad to see him as i always am for i have come to like him very much he sat some time miss mary made the remainder of some gelatine that he sent over sunday he said the poor soldier to whom it was given relished it exceedingly and was getting better he said he would tell him that a young lady made it with her own hands that they seemed so gratified at the idea of a lady doing anything for them mrs mcguire came out yesterday with miss mary she is going to stay several days the weather has moderated very much is now quite warm i think it will rain soon i finished eva's hat monday it is a very good shape in spite of my trouble about it eva was at mrs roane's yesterday and says she admired it very much thursday dec 10th 63 sunday night there was a soldier here from bragg's army he was on foot and we took him in though the house was full he brought a newspaper which contained news of the late battle between bragg and rosencranz it appears that bragg was defeated but i am in hopes from the tenour of the despatches that he may recover his position the dispatch said that the washington and cobb artillery had been taken with all their guns i do not know whether john and angus and green raoul were in that division but oh i hope not i have been thinking of them and their sister all the week it has seemed as if i were walking among memories of the dead and absent and a grief like that of first bereavement has been with me oh if i only knew where valeria was i might write to her and that would be some relief from the grief of her absence i wonder if she has any idea of how constantly she is in my thoughts ever lovingly and with a great desire mrs mcguire went away yesterday she had improved from her visit i have been busy as usual during the week reading and teaching yesterday loring went out to where they were gathering corn and as eva and miss mary were away and georgie sick with a chill i could have no school i sewed awhile on father's glove and after finishing it took up cosmos but after reading a little i found i had such a headache and felt so sick that i was obliged to lie down i slept until dinner and awoke much better last night we recommenced our readings which had been interrupted during mrs mcguire's visit we have nearly finished little dorritt eva had a chill sunday but took quinine and did not have another georgia has had two this week i hope he will not have another he has grown yellow already mr seale came back today he brought some flour and some skins for father he had been gone a month he brought me a letter from mrs morancy a letter so affectionate and so like herself that it was extremely grateful to me it is in answer to one i sent her by mr barclay the other day he called here a few moments was looking remarkably well he is very gentlemanly in appearance with a face very attractive to me and one which is unlike any i ever saw before the weather has been disagreeable for several days dark and cold willie is at home this evening has just returned i suppose his arrangements for his substitute are quite finished now i never speak of it and cannot think of it without pain which is so much the worse that it has none of the softness of sadness but rather a little mingling of self reproach that i should ever seem to lack affection for a brother who has always been to me the kindest and dearest that a brother can be monday dec 21st 1863 i have just read the closing sentences of lamartine's voyage en orient and closed the book with a feeling like that of parting from some old friend how beautiful that book is and how much pleasure has given to me to me it has been a glimpse into new and unknown world full of romantic life and beauty it is not a description of travels that i have read i seem to have lived with the traveller sharing his thoughts his emotions and his beautiful and grand pictures i had a letter from miss kate stone saturday it contains the sad news of her brother's death from a hurt received by his horse this is the second brother she has lost in the army there is now but one remaining and he is just recovering from severe wounds how much sorrow everywhere how different our feelings now from those this season brings in time of peace a shadow of evil to come hangs over us father's face is sad and anxious he has heard something lately that leads him to fear that the yankees will make monroe a permanent post he looks forward to losing all his property and perhaps a worse fate i should be willing to endure poverty willing to labour for my bread all the rest of my life if i could see my country in peace see the south take her place among nations and be able to say with grateful pride i am a southerner this is the end i hope and pray for and i believe it will come though now our sky looks so dark our foes within our inefficient and false officers and the lukewarmness of the people are what we have contend with these are foes far more powerful than the yankees and when i think of the corruption in our midst and see no genius powerful enough to crush it i fear that we shall gain our liberty only after years of war and perhaps anarchy there is to be a ball in monroe christmas eve i have received an invitation and yesterday mrs mcguire sent to urge me to go with her but i am far from wishing to participate in such gaiety i shall go to mrs delary's concert because miss mary is to play and sing otherwise i should not think of it it is to be on next monday night i am not very well the last few days am nervous and weak i have been having some teeth filled and my ill feelings are perhaps owing partly to that mrs brantley and miss randall a relative of hers spent the night with us thursday the weather has been very cold for several days but is warmer now the ground did not thaw for three days we had some ice cream sunday frozen with ice from the little stream in the grove wednesday dec 30th 1863 christmas has come and the holidays are almost gone before i have written a word about it the day before christmas was busy cooking all day and this made us feel a little like christmas was coming father and miss mary went into town that day and brought out some candy and pecans with which we filled the children's stockings they woke up before day in the morning and were highly delighted john was full of surprise for he cannot remember last christmas and if he could we had no santa claus then we had our stockings hung up and candy in them and miss mary scratched the chimney bask in imitation of santa claus carriage wheel tracks georgie came in our room in the morning and related with a wondering air how he could see the marks of santa claus feet on mother's room chimney we then showed him ours and he was strengthened in his belief after they were dressed the children ran out to distribute candy among the little negroes and before breakfast all had disappeared when our late breakfast was over we made egg nogg for the negroes who gathered round the back door highly delighted there were many of them for most of the railroad negroes were here when they had all had a glass round mother filled her great punch bowl again for the white folks and we sent for dr mcdonough to come and take a glass he was obliged to go back again though to attend to his sick dr compton had gone in to a ball given on christmas eve by the d d dy a company of young ladles in town he had insisted on dr mcdonough's taking christmas day as a holiday but instead of coming out to take his place as he had promised he left dr mcdonough all alone did not come out until the day after christmas dr mcdonough came over again about two to dinner but after sitting an hour or more was obliged to return to see a sick man and did not get back until dinner had come on and then he had to leave soon after so that i am afraid our invitation which was meant to give him pleasure was more of an inconvenience we had singing and playing for an hour or more in the evening and then closed the day with a few pages from homer's iliad mr haddrick one of our couriers came down to hear the music and seemed somewhat cheered he looked low spirited before thinking about home i suppose he is a very young man quite modest and well mannered at first he was very shy but is getting a little acquainted now he never saw a piano before he came here and ours is quite a curiosity to him altogether our christmas day was better than the last principally because father was here but yet it was by no means merry as it could not be now when our prospects are so uncertain and gloomy the next two days passed quietly enough monday we went in to the concert at mrs delary's general mouton's command from lower louisiana has just arrived and part of it was crossing at trenton so we were obliged to drive down to the monroe ferry this is dreadfully conducted they take almost an hour to make a trip and the landing is so bad that to get out they have to jump the wagons this is simply making the mules spring out of the flat a few paces from the beach and bring the wagon down after them rather a perilous thing the lieutenant on guard at the ferry was a texan he was very kind and polite to us and let us go over as soon as possible but now comes the catastrophe they had fixed the landing as well as they could but it was still dreadful here all came out of the carriage but mother and uncle jim started to drive on the mules gave a spring into the flat and before we could speak the fore wheels had come against it with a dreadful jar and the springs breaking the carriage came crashing down the mules were so gentle they did not stir and mother got out safely but both the front springs were snapped and the axle sprung we were thankful mother was not hurt for it was indeed a narrow escape everybody said they knew it would be so except our kind texan who said he thought it was dangerous willie had accompanied us on horseback but he was obliged to turn and drive the mules home i don't know how we should have done but for our kind lieutenant who went over in the flat with us and assisted us out indeed all the soldiers were very good and seemed sorry instead of glad at our accident we laboured up the hill completely loaded with packages rose had her blankets and a carpet bag to carry i had a shawl and bundle and mother a box we parted from miss may at the top of the hill for she was going to mrs mcguire's the street was crowded with soldiers and our walk was anything but agreeable we got to mrs stevens just in time to make ourselves presentable for the concert and then we were rather late and our seats were in the furthest corner of the room it happened very pleasantly though for us for we were seated by a window in the alcove between it and the fireplace there was quite a group of gentlemen one opened a conversation with mrs kenison and mary in that incidental manner which so often happens there was another one with him a georgian and we found some mutual acquaintances so that we soon became quite social when we had been there some time lieutenant flournoy came through the window behind us and got a seat between me and my next neighbour against the wall i was very much surprised to see him and rather pleasantly so for i have a sort of liking for him though rather of a negative kind then mrs kenison's brother in law a good looking young creole found his way through the window to our corner and so in spite of the dull music we managed to pass a tolerable evening if i had had no one else but lieut flournoy i might have been rocked to sleep by his gallant nonsense a repetition of how he missed ladies society and how much he enjoyed it and a lot of other things not more exciting but the gentlemen behind were very pleasant lieut flournoy introduced them the first as lieut barrett and the georgian as capt somebody i could not catch the name if it had not been for the carriage being broken i should have passed quite a pleasant evening the charades were quite interesting and miss mary was complimented in our corner several times mrs stevens and may both pressed me to stay until after new years there and i should have liked it but wanted to come home to see the negro's frolic last night father had the partition in our long shanty taken down and they danced there as they did last year they commenced dancing about nine o'clock dr mcdonough came over in the evening and after we had given him some music we all went out to see the dancing about eleven we grew tired and came away but when we woke up this morning the fiddle was still going but the ranks of the dancers were considerably thinned rose made her debut last night she was dressed out in a flounced white skirt a pink tarlton body with a gold breast pin and a wreath of white roses she danced every set i believe until morning annie was dressed in a low necked white muslin and she looked better than rose i think i haven't done anything today of course we had breakfast late and then dr mcdonough came over and a lady wife of a sick man at the hospital slept here last night and her brother in law came over for her and wanted to hear some music and then i had some little things to put in order so that it was quite late before i sat down to my journal and i have had so many interruptions a capt fouet came here to see father on business this morning and sat until dinner and he asked for some music and father sent for me so i was beguiled into the parlour before i knew he was there and could not get out again till dinner time and now it is so late that i am afraid i cannot write to mrs morancy as i intended it is a pleasant evening to write a real rainy evening thursday dec 31st 1863 the last night of the old year today has been dark cold and snowy and the wind has blown and whistled all day long but it is stilled now and the quiet stars shine brightly in the cloudless sky tomorrow's sun will rise upon a new year and in this year if it please god to help me i will try to do better i will set to work earnestly and perseveringly to cure the great faults which i know i have and to find out those that are now hidden what is in store for us in the coming year we cannot tell but from all we see now it will doubtless be fraught with sorrow and trial the next new years eve we may be homeless but whatever happens i want to have a firm faith in god in my redeemer then all else will be easier to bear goodbye then old year i will not complain at the lot thou hast brought to me for though i sorrow indeed that i have not better improved them the cares the disappointments thou hast brought have been good for me it saddens me to think how little real progress i have made and i feel anxious for my resolutions for the future it is so hard to be persevering in my efforts in moments of humiliation and enthusiasm i feel able to do and bear many things but the little daily trials of temper which come to everyone find me wanting and here as everywhere i find the demon of selfishness starting up against my better and holier nature oh how often does my weakness allow it to triumph how often i forget or neglect my only refuge
monday dec 11th 1864 it has been so long since i wrote that i can scarcely remember where i left off i have not had school for about two weeks father went to downsville to carry the wheat to mill a week ago last tuesday and george and loring went with him they returned wednesday it is true but we were very busy making over some old dresses for miss mary and eva and so we did not have school monday miss mary and i went over to mrs dortch's and spent the day and night and such a delightful day as it was mrs dortch is such a sweet agreeable lady and has such a pleasant husband and nice boys and such a cunning little boy and altogether there are so many such agreeables about the family i could never eulogize them enough we found eliza baker and her grandmother mrs warfleld there spending the day which added to its pleasantness the next morning before leaving mrs dortch gave as a number of rose cuttings and one or two roots which i have not yet set out in my garden an account of the cold we called at mrs willson's on our return to monroe and while there a soldier came up who was on his way home from the other side of the mississippi river and wanted mrs w to send him to monroe as we were going directly in we took him in the carriage with us in return he entertained us with many miraculous stories which i have not time to recount here but one was so extraordinary i cannot omit it he had been in prison in elmira new york for ten months said the yankees were very cruel to them for instance once they shot fifteen at once with one ball as they were lying asleep are you sure sir said i oh yes he said the ball passed through the bodies of five killing them instantly and wounded the other ten so they died what a pity people can't tell the truth we got to mrs stevens some time before dimmer i felt very weak and ill all day and did not enjoy it as much as i usually do a visit to mary in the evening eliza baker came up to tea and some gentlemen came in afterwards i suppose it was on account of my dullness that the evening passed heavily to me i have been so little in society for so long a time that the light conversation which generally forms the staple between young ladies and gentlemen is quite strange and distasteful to me as it always was and i am utterly unable to carry it on with any spirit the next day we received an invitation to spend the day at miss warfield's we did so and found it extremely pleasant mrs warfield is a very nice lady and exerted herself easily and agreeably to entertain us she gave me some rose cuttings and quite a number of bulbous roots for my garden it was quite late when the carriage came up from mrs stevens for us and the evening had grown cold though the morning had been very pleasant we found we could not cross at the trenton ferry and drove down to monroe there was a very obliging wagon master there who gave himself a good deal of trouble to put us across the flat was just loading and had a government wagon with four mules on it but he uncoupled the mules and drew up his wagon and uncle jim drove down when lo and behold the front wheels only of the carriage could get on the flat but they took out the mules pulled in the carriage took out the tongue and we were all on the flat was jammed there was not room for the men to row hardly miss mary and i sat in the carriage the sky was darkly clouded the north wind blew us down the river and we were twenty minutes crossing oh how thankful and rejoiced we were when we reached this side we closed up the carriage and rode comfortably home they were all quite surprised to see us at such a late hour we found mr templeton here on his way to texas mary stevens had asked me to come in friday and go to a surprise party to be given at mr m'fee's i told mother about it and at first she did not appear to want me to go i had not expected she would and was not disappointed but was much surprised the next morning when she sent for me out of the school room to come and prepare a dress to go it was a purple grenadine which father had bought for her five years ago in new york and which she had never made up we worked very busily and succeeded in finishing it just in time friday father went to trenton and crossed the river with me and we found mrs stevens carriage waiting for me on the other side it was quite cold very cold indeed for it had sleeted the night before and the ground was wet but we went to the party the rooms were well warmed and there were a great many young ladies there most of them pretty and well dressed and a plenty of young men we had or at least i had a delightful evening i danced about half the sets would have danced more as i am so fond of it but there were so many prettier young ladies present and better acquainted with the gentlemen that i could not expect much attention however i enjoyed looking on very much when i did not dance this is the first party i ever attended it was quite late when we returned home mrs willson and julia were of our party but went out home that night mrs willson's second daughter has at last reached home she has been away seven years and it is four years since her mother saw her and now i come to what i have been hardly restraining myself all this time i have got a letter a long precious letter at last from my dear valeria oh it has made me so happy every now and then i wonder what makes me feel so happy and then i remember it in her letter i cannot describe the pleasure it gives me somehow it seems as if all the bitter past four years were blotted out and it was as when i last saw her before the war ah before the war i was at mrs stevens i have been looking for a letter for several weeks and hoping every time i sent to the post office but this time i had sent and a mail from the east had come but was obliged to go to shreveport for distribution but father came up to mrs stevens saturday before dinner and after i had spoken to him and kissed him said what would you give for a letter i said you are joking pa there is none for me i began to feel in his coat pocket no he said and stooped to his overcoat i took the letter in a sort of maze and looked at it blindly he said eufaula at last i could have cried for joy i could open the letter but turned it over and over and was so glad i have read it over and over since then i have her again in my sight as i read those lines so lately from her hand my darling my dearest friend but i am very tired and cold and though i could write pages thus my tired side admonishes me i have been sitting too long mary stevens came out with me i full of my happiness enjoyed the ride fully but she was made sick by the motion she spent the night with us and returned yesterday afternoon i received a note from willie saturday he was just starting on a raid to the river after mules he thought all the yankees had left the river he was quite well i am so glad of that but oh how cold he must be this freezing weather it has been very cold for several days and last night made thick ice and poor willie has but two blankets an the frozen ground tuesday dec 20th we have had such a long week of warm cloudy weather yesterday evening the wind changed to the north and the rain came down in torrents and we hoped it would clear this morning but it has kept up a slow cold drizzle all day mr barr passed sunday evening and left a letter for me from mrs morancy she says they will expect the children and insists upon my going up with them but i cannot do so i would like it very much if it were best for me to go she says they have been having concerts and tableaux at homer for the benefit of our suffering missouri soldiers they have already made 3,000 the papers we received yesterday contain very exciting news we learn that sherman is down in the heart of georgia has passed through milledgeville destroying all the public buildings there are rumours that we have defeated sherman terribly at millen so near uncle david every georgian is in arms they mist have passed right by our old oakland oh i am so excited when i think of it how i wish i were a man and in georgia how i wish i were there anyway to know what they we doing to rejoice with our noble georgians and with all the brave soldiers who are there fighting for us for i am sure the yankees are but marching to their own destruction it seems to me sherman's audacity is unequalled but he will meet his just reward yet though i do thus wish to be as it were on the scene of action yet it seemed to me yesterday for the first time that i could begin to see a mercy in our being held back from crossing the river we should probably have been in that part of georgia which has been made a battle ground i read the president's message this morning it is indeed fine in every respect so calm earnest eloquent and bringing all it's strength from that high faith in right and humanity and that strong reliance on god which so enobles human nature we have finished the antiquary which we all liked very much of course and which we shall be talking about for the next week or two we were interrupted two nights in the most exciting part mr gordon has been attending to some business for father and in return father undertook to do a part of his tax assessing over here he was absent three days the first night mr gordon very unexpectedly came over to stay all night and we were all highly astonished by a call from dr melton in the evening the next night as loring was away we thought we would wait until saturday night when father would be at home mr gordon came up again saturday night to see father but we read in spite of his visit and he seemed highly entertained i have been writing more by feeling than sight for some time and precious penmanship i have made of it it is now quite too dark to write any more friday dec 31st 1864 i am all alone in the house father and miss mary and eva left yesterday oh we miss them so very much all the house seems desolate mother and i sit together to keep our spirits up but succeed but poorly i was very busy yesterday cleaning up and putting to rights in my room which was indeed an operation sadly needed after the work and confusion to get the children ready i have been doing nothing today but read that marvellously eloquent and tender book les miserables it is so beautiful it seems to distill the spirit of a compassionate saviour from the most miserable as well as the grandest beings in human nature mother and the children have gone down to mrs lidwell's this evening i stayed at home to write a letter but as it is a letter to julia compton i don't know how far i shall get in it it is so pleasant to feel that everything here in my room is perfectly clean and orderly as i know by personal inspection truly i think neatness forms a part of that broad basis upon which enjoyment is built then this quiet house in which there is not a soul but myself this wind sweeping through the leafless treetops and branches hung with withered leaves with such a beautiful living music and above all the beautiful lovely blue sky with white feathery clouds flecking it and the warm brilliant sunlight falling upon the landscape which winter has shorn of all its covering with that peculiar brightness which makes us feel light and life and warmth and yet penetrates the heart with a sort of etherial stillness which i have never seen expressed so much to mind as in that line sunshine lay sleeping on the hill thus it lies sleeping on that brown hillside thus it lightens that beautiful sky against which rises the strong dark and spiritual heads of my pines and it seems to me the soul of this sunshine is gathered into and breathes out from the little violets which sweetly perfume my desk and which bring to my soul the loveliness of spring though they are only one or two which have peeped out after the freezing cold then through the open window comes the twitter of little birds the small hum of insects and the living sound which adds instead of diminishing the silence all these things fill my soul with quiet rapture they incline me to delicious reverie and my mind is softened by the deep pathos of the grand renunciations of jean val jean and the sufferings of the poor little cosette i have for a long time been so very busy it is so long since i have been thus alone with the sunshine and the wind and the trees that i take pleasure in my idleness in a certain freedom for all cares from all occupation that is so delightful when rarely enjoyed how impossible is it for me to express all this quiet rapture all the grateful swelling of the heart all the music of the soul which this deep this eternal music of the winds awakes as it passes over me if i had the pen of a ready writer if i had the art the marvellous art of combining into a melody of sounds all this melody of the senses the heart soul and mind how blest i would be but oh how blest am i and how i thank him who has given to me the capability of joy which is so pure and deep since it comes from him but let me now remember and write these what we call events but which are not events as much as a new thought or a happy feeling the date with which i commenced reminds me that christmas has passed that the old year is passing through its last days were it not for this date i could indeed hardly persuade myself that it is so for how unlike is this to december and how unlike is this quiet time to christmas week all christmas day i kept saying over and over it is christmas to keep myself in mind of it it was very much like any other sunday only sometimes we would hear a merry christmas which sounded hollow like the echo of past times we had an egg nogg in the morning but drank it with only an occasional attempt at hilarity mr gordon came up christmas eve and spent the day with us we had a very fine dinner which we could not fully enjoy for thinking of willie in the evening we had some ice cream which the children malted at the fire and so the day passed i had an hour of pleasure when i read the christmas service and beautiful psalms and lessons and again in the evening when miss may and i contemplated the glories of the setting sun we retired early as we were fatigued with having sat up late the night before to reach a good stopping place in old mortality in which we were all highly interested mr gordon included i am afflicted much for the past month or two with a dreadful debility which at nightfall sometimes almost prostrates me especially in warm weather we have had so much warm damp weather since the winter months commenced monday tuesday and wednesday we were very busy preparing for the approaching departure of the children as the roads were very bad and we had but few mules father concluded to take miss mary and eva in the north carolina wagon which was obliged to go to carry their baggage so thursday morning early it was brought up to the door to pack this was quite an undertaking as they carried all their bedroom furniture besides clothing and books the wagon was quite full even with father's close packing they had such a nice seat father laid their mattress on the floor with part of it against two trunks for the back and part against the wagon sides so that they had a complete large easy chair which was very soft with blankets laid on it father sat just before them on some blankets laid on the corn prince rode one of the mules it me so hard to tell them goodbye for such a long time it was lonesome indeed for willie to be gone but doubly lonesome now we miss them especially at meal times where the table is now almost round and at night when it used to be so pleasant around the fire but now only mother and i are left a mr james and mr britt took supper here last night and the former remained all night mr britt said he saw willie at oak ridge a few days ago that he was well and on detached service i believe i have not written here since tabitha now mrs shields was here she and her husband and baby spent the night with us last week on their way to homer i was so glad to see her and she has such a sweet little baby the setting sun warns me that i must leave this and commence julia compton's letter if i would finish it tonight
saturday feb'y 1st 62 a week since i wrote and now only to record a most astonishing event mr green spent the day with us mr robert green this morning mother aunt mary and i were sitting talking together when one of the children ran in calling out captain green is come we knew that he was in vicksburg for last night father came out and asked us to guess who was in vicksburg i soon thought of mr green but thought it was absurd to guess him we were all very glad to see him he was as usual perfectly agreeable left soon after dinner as he was riding father's mule and must get in before dark says he hopes to come back and see us again i have been so busy enjoying myself for the past week that i have had no time for writing uncle david aunt mary grandma and hun and kitty arrived last saturday night there has been no school this week it has been so long since we have seen any of them that we could not do anything but enjoy their presence the children have been in a perfect glee have made noise enough to deafen me willie has had the chills again this week i feel so sorry for him
wednesday feb 4th 1863 absent he is very proud of him the children went to a little party at mrs dawson's yesterday and returned in high spirits our little school goes on quite well still i do do wish to help the children both mentally and spiritually that sometimes i fear my very anxiety makes me too strict and injures instead of improves them my chief wish in life is to see all mu family truly happy though i am afraid i do not always set a consistent example but my indolence and selfishness retards the work i would accomplish as for myself i find my heart so full of sinful feelings that i am ready to say i am the chief of sinners and i often fear that i shall never find that perfect peace that the bible promises but i must keep on trying and if i do the bible promises i shall at last succeed tuesday feb'y 17th it has been raining steadily since yesterday morning drip drip drip without a moment's intermission and it seems as if it will continue all day willie just arrived in time my boil burst last night and does not pain me at all this morning i hope i shall soon be able to wear my dress again it is now nine o'clock and i must go to school
feb 2nd 1864 tuesday this is such a beautiful day so cool so clear so bright after we had finished school this morning i had an hour or more before for as miss mary went to the dentist we finished the studies quite soon and i spent the time out in the garden where father is pruning the fruit trees and uncle jim is planting seed it made me feel so happy to be out in the clear warm sunshine with the deep blue sky above and the wind sighing so sweetly through the pines whence it came with fresh warm breath to my cheek everything looks so happy and lovely the children behaved well in school too all three of them had perfect lessons and i was very much pleased with eva for overcoming a lesson in intellectual arithmetic a study very difficult and very distasteful to her this evening too i am having a very pleasant reading time have spent an hour or two with humbolt and am going now to enjoy lamartine it is the first afternoon i have devoted to reading for some time yesterday evening i spent in having annie put up a little fence around our bower in the wood and in planting some violets and periwinkle there i was very much tired by it i take so little exercise that i cannot endure much dr mcdonough came over in the evening i traced out some of my old friends the winter constellations last night i think i never saw the stars more beautifully bright willie left for his duties at millhaven monday we shall not see him again i suppose until saturday drs mcdonough and furness dined here sunday and spent nearly all the afternoon i think i should like dr furness very well he appeared quite pleasant and sensible dr mcdonough has grown to be one of my favorites there seem to be such much undercurrent in him the other night after we had sung annie laurie he got to speaking about the song and incidents connected with it miss mary and he and i were sitting rather apart and as he always speaks in a very low voice the conversation of the others flowed by us he told us a story of a young man who had loved and lost a beautiful young girl and was left by his misfortune in a state of deep dejection one night his friends persuaded him to a party where he was treated with the utmost respect and every effort made to draw him from his deep dejection as he was a fine musician he was led to the piano and the most respectful silence prevailed while he sadly struck a few chords and then wandered in a beautiful symphony at length he commenced to sing annie laurie with unexampled pathos and sweetness when he breathed the concluding words for bonnie annie laurie i'd lay me down and die his voice died away but he remained at the piano his friends waited in silence for some time thinking that he was indulging in one of his frequent reveries on his lost love but seeing that he moved not they approached to arouse him but he was dead it is a beautiful story of tender love and affected me very much dr mcdonough's words faltered more and more towards the end and i saw his soft dark eyes were full of tears they say he was engaged to a young lady but just as they were about to be married she was drowned accidentally if this be so how beautiful in him to remain constant to that one lost love so many years for he is now quite grey headed monday feb 8th 1864 willie left us again this morning we had a very pleasant morning in school the children all did very well loring was a little provoked about his spelling but soon overcame it it has been a long time since he has been in one of his violent passions with me dr mcdonough and dr furness came over yesterday after supper only stayed a short time dr furness twisted and turned about as if he were very uncomfortable and i could scarcely keep my eyes open i was so sleepy and dr mcdonough had not much to say so the evening was not very pleasant there was a very sick man over at the hospital so they could not stay long mr haddicks said they expected him to die today poor fellow how i pity them it must be so hard to die in a hospital i must stop writing from necessity my ink is all used up it is some dr mcd gave me and i have no more fit to use i am ashamed to ask for any more though the dr is so kind he would not hesitate to give it to me wednesday feb 10th the other evening after i finished writing i walked out in the hall and saw the children all in the grove playing so merrily that i went out to join them we played puss in the corner until we were tired and then as we were dancing around singing sweet beans and barley grows miss may saw a buggy coming out and telling the rest of us we all stopped to wonder who it could be it was mr gordon come to see about his teams crossing the river the teams camped here that night and mr gordon left with them the next morning yesterday afternoon we went to the funeral of mr moore mrs lidwell's brother who died monday evening the funeral was very small there were but three or four besides the mourners miss mary and i did not go to the house as we had no conveyance our buggy and ambulance were used by the family but we walked to the grave which is only about a mile and a half from here george and loring went with us we arrived about two hours before the funeral procession came and the time of quiet waiting prepared me to feel the sadness of the scene the burying ground has no enclosure of any sort around it there are a few graves each surround either by a neat paling a rude rail fence or a little sort of roof built over it the dead leaves lie thickly over the ground over head the pines sigh a low requiem which alone breaks the stillness and takes away from the desolation of this rude and lonely spot in sight is the rude church blackened by time and now all fallen into ruin i was deeply touched by the sight of some sweet violets blooming on a mosey grave poor miss anna moore the tears came in spite of my efforts to restrain them when i saw her silent weeping and thought how desolate how lonely she was in seeing the last remains of her father lowered into the grave today is ash wednesday we had school this morning but i took no dinner and spent several hours this afternoon alone with my bible and my thoughts thoughts sad enough when i reflect on my many many faults on the times when i swerve from my right path i had no ink when i wrote before this is little better than none i mixed the dregs of my inkstand with some watery stuff i had and used before i got the other it is too dark to see any longer must put up my book thursday feb 11th we have spent such a pleasant day dr mcdonough has been with us from soon after breakfast until a few minutes ago and he and miss mary have been singing ad practising a great deal of the time last night he and dr furness spent the evening with us and dr d appointed this morning as a practising time so we expected him and did not go into school he came accompanied by mr kimball a great surprise to me i had never met him but twice before and then only by accident he only stayed about fifteen minutes said he wanted to get to vienna tonight he brought me a message from as he said an old friend of mine miss sallie brantley it was that she sent her best love and an urgent invitation to come and see her i feel quite acquainted with miss sallie brantley though i have never seen her i have heard her spoken of so often mr henry reynolds brother of loring's god father and capt thomas also called but did not come in mr reynolds called to know if i had heard recently from his sister mrs veader gave me two letters he had just received from her i was glad to hear from her and to know that she is well mr reynolds said that if i would direct letters to savannah via shreveport putting five ten cent stamps on it it would probably go safely by mail i am so glad to find any way to send a letter this is the last page of my journal book a book which has been with me and been my faithful confidant in so many scenes and in so many different moods i don't know what i should do without my journal it is such a relief to me to write here and this book will always be of peculiar interest to me as the one which holds the record of our eventful of our important journey i shall always like to be able to recall it in all the particularities which i have written down here and which i might gradually forget without this record oakland tuesday feb 16th 1864 willie came home friday night quite unexpectedly he was in monroe hauling corn across the river went away early the next morning mother spent friday with mrs seale brought as some magnolia seed i have not planted them yet saturday morning i set our plants or rather the roots out on the shelves i don't know whether they will revive my geranium is dead i was going to set it in the garden but on taking it up found the roots quite rotten i was not very well saturday and this discovery of my poor dead flower was too much for me it made me so sad it seemed to me to foretell evil to my friend from whom it took it's sweet name i suffer much from debility and low spirits the last few week sometime i am so overpowered by melancholy and find myself in such fits of abstraction that i fear i am losing my mind i must struggle more against it sometimes my body feels so weary and weak and my mind and heart so sad that i can scarcely sit up and feel cross and pettish whenever i am spoken to i think it comes from the state of my health it is exercise i need and i am determined not to neglect this duty any longer as i have done saturday evening mr baxter came he is an old gentleman from georgia not personally known to father though they are mutually acquainted by reputation and have corresponded he and his wife stayed all night here a year ago while father was in virginia and he stopped the other evening to know if we had heard from him but finding father at home and it being late saturday evening he accepted father's invitation to remain with us till monday dr mcdonough cam over saturday night stayed quite late as he thought it would be the last evening he could hear miss mary sing willie was home saturday evening again so that we had quite a company mr baxter told us all some more bad news about the lawlessness and the scarcity of provisions in texas and he and father agreed in thinking georgia the best place for these times or as father emphatically said once before the best place in peace or war mr b came down here to invest some money in lands on the ouachita river he did not do so on examination and inquiry in monroe so he told mother as he passed back to texas this morning sunday morning i was so ill and weak i was obliged to lie down for an hour or two after breakfast was much benefitted by my rest and well enough to eat heartily of roast duck at dinner when dr mcdonough joined us he returned to the hospital in the afternoon but rejoined us after tea to tell us goodbye but while here he received letters from dr furness who is on a visit to mt lebanon telling him that dr f had obtained leave for him to remain here until he came back probably about thursday i found myself scarcely able to sit up in the evening and though the company was very pleasant i rejoiced when we came to our room monday mother was confined to her bed with a bad headache resulting from cold this prevented our having school we were quite lonesome with mother sick and father and willie away father went to millhaven monday morning is not coming back till tomorrow after dinner dr mcdonough came over gave me some ideas on drawing and colouring and made me desire to learn to draw more earnestly than ever miss mary and he practised an hour or two commenced to learn the beautiful song sleeping i dream love it is such a favourite of mine the doctor stayed till after supper we appointed wednesday evening for a horseback ride the last one i shall take in a long time for i am going to send mollie down to millhaven to pasture on the cane thursday she is getting quite poor i spent some time yesterday copying an air which dr mcd improvised an the piano and to which he has written some words i like the air quite well find it difficult to copy from his playing it he does not know the notes of music and cannot write it himself i have not seen the words yet he promised to bring them over this evening it is a hymn for peace he says the wind blows quite cool today though the sun is shining brightly we had a hard rain sunday night the days have been warm and springlike for a week or two past but vegetation has scarcely begun to develop itself the oaks and other forest tress show no buds as yet i suppose this is owing to the frosty nights i have a beautiful pink hyacinth in bloom today it seems to me i never saw such a beautiful shade of pink the violets we blooming again i gather a vase full every morning mother's peas are coming up and so are some few other vegetables but the work in the garden progresses slowly there is so much to do the garden has never been laid out at all until this year i can write no longer now am going this evening to see miss anna moore thursday feb 18th oh it is so cold i have just returned from a walk in the garden with father and though i was well wrapped up i was painfully cold when i came the thermometer stands at 34 in a sheltered place this four deg higher than it was this morning however so we may hope that it will be pleasant again by tomorrow night this cold will put vegetation back again i do not think the fruit trees are sufficiently far advanced for the fruit to be injured i am sure ours are not tuesday evening on my return from mrs lidwell's i found mrs bondurant and mrs marble here before they left a negro boy came up to know if two ladies could stay all night after some little demurring mother consented to take them they were mrs moore and her daughter miss nichols refugees form tensas parish mrs bondurant was slightly acquainted with them and they had a great deal to tell and to hear we found that we had stopped in front of their house about five minutes one day while we were travelling and this circumstance slight as it was made us feel less like strangers they had a dreadful time coming through the swamp broke down once five or six miles from any house and had to ride that distance on mules with only a shawl for a saddle they were quite pleasant miss lucy nichols was very young and very small and very affected appeared like a spoiled only daughter among three older brothers but very good humoured and lively the next morning mrs moore charged me repeatedly to make willie get acquainted with her sons one a lieutenant in the tensas cavalry and one in the commissary department and her last words were to willie repeating the same charge her lieut and her commissary are equally indifferent to me after mrs moore left mother started for monroe to meet father she took georgie with her we had all assembled in the parlour for school finding rose had neglected to make a fire in the schoolroom and willie was putting on his over socks and comforter by the fire when dr mcdonough knocked he spent the day with us which passed quickly and pleasantly in playing and singing and trying songs among which last was his hymn he brought the words over and miss mary learned the air quite correctly we gave the doctor some boiled shoulder and cornbread and cow peas for dinner with some fried eggs for an entree it was all we had and he seemed quite content the evening was so chill and cloudy that we could not ride dr rolls sent for dr mcd in the afternoon near dark it was late when father and mother and little georgie came home they were very cold doctor mcdonough spent the evening this morning we had school again all my scholars behaved well and consequently i feel quite bright tonight i had a good time for reading this evening have been interrupted for several days saturday night feb 20th have just returned from a ride with the dr he came over this morning to ask if i could go this evening i had just sent mollie away this morning and thought i could not go but the dr proposed my riding on dr rolls pony and as i wished very much to ride i consented to what i have never done but once before ride a strange horse the pony was rather rough but i enjoyed my ride very much indeed the weather moderated a good deal last night and it was a delightful evening bright sunlight with a pleasant fresh west wind we rode some distance principally through my favourite wood paths i feel a little fatigued and somewhat stiff it is so long since i rode any on my return i found mrs bondurant here she only stayed a few minutes after i came the doctor did not come in is coming over after tea father is looking very badly now is not sick but overcome with a dreadful debility i have so recently passed through it myself that i can fool with his perfectly he is very much troubled in mind about what is to become of us thinks a little of sending us all to kentucky so that the children can go to school i hope earnestly that he may not decide to do it to me the very idea in insupportable i think it would be better for the children to go on even as they are now rather than for us to be thus separated from him and willie willie was at home last night left this morning we shall not see him for two weeks or more again he is gone up to bayou bartholomew an a keel boat to bring down some corn most of the soldiers from here have gone down to columbia now to protect the negroes who are working on fortifications there now there is some rumour that headquarters will be moved there then we should see but little of willie tuesday feb 22 1864 the birthday of washington an anniversary sacred to the memory of freedom alas how is it now polluted this is the day appointed by the infamous banks for his election for governor and other state officers of louisiana a mere farce the flimsiness of the pretence must be apparent to every mind for the legislative assembly is to have full power except where its decrees conflict the will of lincoln made known as he shall see fit by proclamations from time to time oh that we could free ourselves from this bondage from this disgraceful this heavy yoke when will the time come when we shall be rid of this impudent invader if i were only sure of our final victory it would not be so hard yet resignation is our duty however great the trial we children are quite alone today father and mother have gone to monroe dr mcdonough left monday morning we miss him so much he was here so constantly before he left spent the day and evening with us sunday we parted with sincere regret on both sides mr peterson came out yesterday took dinner with us brought life on the ocean wave which he had copied for miss mary he copies so nicely spoke of his baby says he thinks it is the greatest treasure in the world the weather in fine and warm again i hope we shall have no more cold mother miss may and i went to mrs craig's yesterday evening something was said about our school when mrs craig asked me if i did not want another scholar she was in jest but told her in earnest that if she would send margaret i would do my best for her she is just miss may's age and a nice sensible girl i like her very much she is so plain and industrious and intelligent too friday feb 26th 1864 we had quite an excitement here yesterday evening i was sitting reading when i heard a terrible scream from georgie mother and i were both frightened and started up i ran with several of the servants to the place from whence the screams came and found george up in the other grove with mr heddicks and loring they had erected a machine called a flying horse consisting of a pole supported on a stake by a pin which allowed it to revolve freely some boards were nailed on the ends of the pole and on these two persons were to sit one on each end while another pushed it around george and lory had gotten on these seats but the pole being made of pine broke and poor georgie fell the pole came down on his ancle and sprained it badly he was very much frightened as well as hurt we brought him up to the house bathed his foot in cold water and afterwards finding it much swollen rubbed it with some hot liniment it does not pain him now but he cannot walk on it the fine weather still continues i have been eager to get out in the garden all day but have not been at liberty until now have felt quite lazy all day and very dreamy had a very vivid dream this morning just before rising of my dear friend valeria and have been thinking of her all day it seems to me i can see her before me and very often in spite of my sober reason when i lift up my eyes i expect to see her beloved form this morning when i was thinking of her it seemed to me a long narrow vista opened before me and in the distance was her familiar figure as clear and full as when i last saw her more than three years ago how vivid my imagination is sometimes these impressions are so powerful that i feel like ascribing to them a kind of spiritual reality mother brought me a little bunch of violets and geranium leaves from may stevens the other day her geranium is putting out finely i want to go in and get a cutting from her but we have but three mules here one is sick and the other two are ploughing dr furness spent the evening here the other day was quite agreeable i keep thinking whenever i see him of his neglect of the soldiers these couriers here say that he does not care anything for them and i have heard him make several remarks which i thought rather unfeeling one notices it more by contrast with dr mcdonough who is so kind and conscientious monday feb 29th i rose this morning long before day and have some leisure time before breakfast to write last night we were joyfully surprised by willie's coming home we did not expect him for several days poor fellow he was quite troubled had worked very hard to get back to monroe before the twilight should make another trip on account of some of the railroad negroes who were on her and who were very much dissatisfied but when he got to monroe he found that the twilight had come and gone and that four of the negroes had left her at monroe two willie thinks may have gone entirely the other two he supposes to be at millhaven willie had promised his squad to give them a holiday at millhaven as a reward for their hard work but when he went to the government clerk to get the order he found him locked up playing cards and when he got access to him he would not give him the necessary order then willie had no horse to come out on he went all over monroe and trenton and could neither hire nor borrow one then being in a last extremity he went to capt seale's and lucy lent him her pony he arrived at home about eight o'clock quite tired is obliged to go to vienna today to see capt oliver about the negroes and we have nothing here to ride but three lazy mules to ride any of them would be torture willie will have to borrow or hire a horse from dr temple and he hates to borrow a horse the weather has changed so suddenly yesterday morning it was very warm but in the evening there was every appearance of a violent storm the wind blew cold from the north and we found a fire very comfortable indeed it rained last night and is very chilly this morning margaret craig came saturday for me to alter her hat as i promised i went to immediately and finished lining trimming and all some hours before dark i succeeded beyond my hopes it was the prettiest shaped brim i have ever made and as miss edgeworth would say was vastly becoming to margaret we have mrs temple's backgammon board and chess men now and father and i are learning to play chess we are learning from the encyclopaedia brittanica were so fascinated with it saturday night that we did not read any but sat up till after ten playing chess ten is a very late hour for us poor little georgie had a chill friday night and the fever never left him till late saturday evening he looks very badly but escaped his chill last night i hope he may get better now his leg is improving he walked on it a good deal yesterday but in the evening complained very much of his knee which was much swollen
friday feb 3rd 1865 oh it is such a beautiful beautiful day so warm and sunny with white clouds passing over the sun and veiling the landscape in a dreamy light the birds are singing the little chickens chirping about the yard and the sunny air is full of insects yesterday and for four days before it rained slowly steadily until everything was dripping the sky was as gloomy the earth as disagreeable as were our prospects oh that our national sun might thus shine forth it is so hard to believe in the existence of yankees and war when all around is so bright and beautiful i can scarce bear to recapitulate the events of the past day or two but i must begin wednesday as for several days before it rained and drizzled all day with occasional heavy showers we were pursuing our usual avocations listlessly and wearily and the day was darkening into evening when mr gordon came up on his return from his expedition to delhi he was dressed in a complete suit of yankee clothes very ugly as they all are he had not succeeded in getting anything except twenty eight yards of calico and a little coffee i was not sorry for i did not desire to get anything from the yankees nor through mr gordon he brought a package of yankee papers full of the march through georgia and the unsuccessful attack upon fort fisher they were gloriously repulsed how sad that it was not an enduring repulse well to my recital thursday morning were sitting quietly at breakfast the pouring rain had degenerated into a slow drizzle and it did not at all raise our spirits i was suffering one of my sick days and felt hardly able to stand we had been at the table but a short time when emmeline came to say that some one wanted to see father he found that it was a messenger from the steward of the hospitals who had sent for father to hook up his ox team immediately as the hospital was going to move father of course made a short answer to this insolent demand and came back to breakfast the man went back to the hospital and returned very soon saying that if the order was not complied with he would bring over a force and press it this unwarrantable and impertinent proceeding was neither unexpected nor alarming and father told then to bring over their force in the mean time the wagon had been driven off to the woods we learned from the second messenger that the yankees were expected at monroe and that was the cause of the sudden move after finishing my breakfast i went up stairs with my pupils whom i with difficulty recalled from the lot they being in a state of high excitement about the threatened impressment we had not fairly commenced school when the force arrived and at the first word of permission my pupils broke away down stairs the men looked for and found the wagon but to no purpose as the driver had loosed and driven off the oxen they returned to the hospital and my pupils returned to their lessons after the fuss was over father and mr gordon rode to town a man who was driving some government cattle came in before they left to ask permission to put his cattle into one of our enclosures he said that the yankees were really coming to monroe and all the quartermasters and commissary stores were being brought out as fast as possible accordingly we soon saw the road filled with government teams driving on through the rain and sometimes sticking in the mud i found it quite impossible to bring loring to any degree of attention to his studies however i continued to try georgie learned his first lessons quickly and well and i soon dismissed him mr shields called by at about ten o'clock he was on his way to homer had been up all night packing and said he supposed the yankees were in monroe as they were reported within four miles when he left he left some account books with us and took letters to miss may and eva and some books for them loring had not yet learned one of his lessons when he ran again greatly excited by a herd of cattle which had by mistake been turned into the yard and were madly running to and fro as the negroes tried to get them out loring begged to be allowed to go and help and after that i found it impossible to get him in again so i closed the school room and brought my palmetto plaiting down in the dining room the day was miserably rainy the ground was surcharged with water and it seemed to be oozing out at every pore all was confusion people coming and going and everything in disorder the hours were unnoticed in the confused jumble and i don't know what time it was when mrs seale's negro man came out with her wagon loaded with meat brought here for safe keeping and bringing a note from lucy saying that she would come out and stay with us while the yankees were here if we would send in the ambulance as she had no conveyance the note further said that the yankees had stopped at grant's mill the night before and robbed mrs grant of everything she had our ambulance had gone to texas to carry one of our servants mary who wished to be with her husband who was at the iron works so of course we had nothing to send after a while things quieted down a little loring came in and read some in rosamond and george was just beginning to read when a buggy drove up to the door i came out and found lucy who had driven out with adjutant mcguire this is a young man who was at home in trenton on furlough from alexandria and was of course obliged to leave on the approach of the yankees after assisting lucy out and taking out her packages he drove on to find an asylum further out in the country he gave me a letter from willie which i was very glad indeed to get lucy said she had a dreadful ride out the roads were exceedingly muddy at one place the horses plunged breast deep in the mire it was raining all the time sometimes fast then slow i was still miserably weak but got a little excited after dinner by the insolent pertinacity of those hospital people who came over again for our yoke of oxen which had not been driven off i regard the conduct of the doctors in this proceeding as in the highest degree ungentlemanly father might have had no objection to their taking his team had they asked it properly but he will never submit to unwarrantable impressments as father was not at home we could of course do nothing but the oxen were cut and they were a long time trying to catch them as we were talking about it one of the children came in saying that there was a soldier out at the door mother went out soldier indeed he deserved no such honourable name it was capt griffen a renegade georgian whom i mentioned in my journal last summer an old schoolmate and intimate friend of mother's in savannah he is now a yankee cotton speculator who has no motive but to get rich out of the war i had never seen him before but at the mention of his name my choler rose and i left the parlour in disgust before he dismounted i had just been reading an account of the yankee march through georgia and my feelings against them always bitter were raised to the highest pitch i felt it impossible to meet one of their hated nation after a few moments father came up and went to drive off the hospital men immediately afterwards major buchner and a certain major o'connor came up and were invited in by capt griffin this major buchner is a southernor and a confederate officer but one would never think so from his intimate consultations with these yankees this major o'connor it seems is a renegade from natchez formerly a rich planter now like captain griffin a yankee cotton speculator i have seldom been so angry nor i think so justly angry as at these visitors i am never loud in my anger but mother saw it and was i think displeased she said i ought to treat with politeness those who were here in our home by father's invitation they were none here by father's invitation except captain griffin whom father met on the road and casually asked as an old acquaintance though he no more approves of his present course than i do who hold him and his courses in abhorrence mother naturally feels inclined towards him his parents and hers were close friends and he was one of her childhoods companions but i cannot even in consideration of her inclinations repress or conceal feelings which i consider it a principle to cherish i avoided these honest men until evening when joe seale and an acquaintance of his came up they said the yankees were in monroe when they left mr lockett the post master from trenton came out about dark and asked to stay all night of course he was promptly answered in the affirmative glad to see some one to whom i could be polite i lavished all my attentions on this honest little man who has steadfastly kept his sandy whiskers and shrewdly twinkling eyes in his post office at trenton through the viccissitudes of that fallen city we were sitting in the parlour the yankee party were at dinner in the dining room after a while mother came in and was followed by capt griffen to whom she introduced me as her oldest daughter i rose coldly but he put out his hand and slightly hesitating i accepted it i cared not to disguise the feelings with which i regarded and withdrew to the window with my paper how can i but hate the yankees when they exulting over what they think the approaching downfall of our country their papers are full of their boasts fort fisher has fallen one costly and extensive armada and army did indeed fail but the yankees have money have men in abundance they brought armada and army back and after three days of constant bombarding they stormed the fort by sea and land they were once driven back our troops our noble troops fought desperately hand to hand from one defence to another but they were at last overpowered yes many a gallant southerner fell there and the yankee flag now flouts the sky where ours used to wave fort fisher is theirs savannah new orleans vicksburg are theirs hood is defeated lee threatened and the yankees exult the insurrection they say is about to collapse our country is divided and the sentiments of the people they say are union a just providence does now indeed punish us grievously but we are not yet deserted we are not yet fallen our day will came our day of triumph i certainly believe will come but should it never arrive should we miserably fail because and only became we would not will our freedom it matters not to me i never will i never can in thought or word submit to these detested enemies or cease to wish to detest them i do not fear them here it matters not that they come to an insignificant place like monroe but it grieves me to the soul to think of georgia thus desolated and of all our defeats in the east we had a house full thursday night captain griffen major buchner maj o'connor mr lockett joe seale and his young friend and lucy were all here i came in the parlour after supper but we all retired very early and i was glad as my head ached wearily this morning lucy was not dressed till quite late and we took our breakfast alone after all the rest had finished gradually they all dispersed capt griffen and his companion went into town maj buchner went away in a few hours lieut stubbs came in and stayed till after dinner when he and father went to trenton to hear the news mr lockett also went in saturday feb 4th capt griffen came back yesterday evening about sunset and father and lieut stubbs came soon after they had not gone over the river as there were no flats they said there were only about one hundred and eighty yankees or two hundred at most who had ridden into town and out again without dismounting they had not troubled anything in monroe but had taken all of mrs mason's meat and had dinner at her house they had no wagons nothing except what they carried on their horses col harrison was in town when they came narrowly escaped being captured they chased him about a mile down the river but he and his companions were mounted on good horses and they bore them off safely it is misting this morning and i am afraid the sun will not shine all day capt griffen left soon after breakfast father and lieut stubbs went to monroe left quite late lucy was very anxious to get home and was greatly relieved this morning when a negro boy brought a note from adjutant mcguire saying that he was going to trenton and would take miss lucy if she wished she did wish and said is it not kind in him to bring me out and take me in again i answered no according to my idea he is highly favoured by your company as for me i think a young man highly favoured when i look at him the lieut called for lucy before she had finished her late breakfast i hear the hospital horn i had hoped they had left altogether but they have all come back the quarter master's trains and all are coming back i shall put up my book until father returns i do not feel at all like writing this morning tuesday night feb 7th we were so joyfully surprised last night it was the first night we had been without company since wednesday and after i had read two chapters in our history of the revolution lory went to bed and father and mother played backgammon i took up a book and had read a little when i heard willie's well known voice it thrilled through me instantly and exclaiming it is willie i ran through the hall followed by mother and father by the time willie reached the house antony and four or five of the other negroes were around him and lory was out in his night shirt oh we were all so glad we brought him in in triumph he had ridden nearly fifty miles that day had come up to col mcneil with some guerilla prisoners and then got leave to come and get his clothes poor fellow he needed them badly enough his pants were quite ragged and his undershirt in strips his coat was buttonless and threadbare his socks were a sight he had ridden all day through mud and sleety rain and had stood guard for five nights previous so he was quite tired but we sat up quite late he had had nothing to eat since morning and of course supper was the first consideration then we had so many questions to ask and he so much to tell he looks very well indeed and fleshy enough but not so much so as i expected from antony's account he is in good spirits full of the praises of capt buchner and the tensas cavalry he says they have been doing considerable good down there in tensas parish and they are well supplied with everything says if the tensas cavalry had been here they would have given the yankees some fighting what a fine thing is esprit du corps i have been quite busy today lining his hat and then knitting a helmet or visor which he says is very comfortable and he needed one very much during the past severe weather the clouds broke away last night at last and today it has been clear and tolerably cold i must go to bed now am the only one up in the house willie retired very early on account of his extraordinary fatigue and father was quite tired having been busy all day making willie a pair of spurs he leaves thursday the joy of his coming has not worn away before we begin to dread his leaving saturday feb 11th willie left thursday morning after a very early breakfast i did not feel his first departure so much as this i seemed to feel more that he was really a soldier and going to danger but i could not wish him to stay home longer and we had the pleasure of seeing him well supplied with all that a soldier needs i am so truly thankful that he is strong and well and cheerfully inclined to fulfil his duty he is such a dear kind brother i was so happy while i could have him in my sight it now seems almost like a dream that he has been home father went to monroe with him and there he heard from col harrison that the company is ordered up to columbia willie took prince with him wanted antony to stay with flora about a month longer until the mud dried up a little in the swamp i left off my account of the yankee raid last saturday before we knew anything about it the facts as i have been able to gather them are about these there were somewhere about two thousand of them in all of whom a few only came to monroe they left in great haste on account as is supposed of an intercepted dispatch of col harrison from which they learned that marmaduke's cavalry were in the vicinity they committed few depredations about monroe we heard that they had taken all mrs mason's meat and robbed mrs willson of all her clothing but neither report was true they did not take anything from mrs mason and took from mrs willson only three old blankets and broke some mantel ornaments and other china they went to mr john scarborough's and commanded him to climb up in his smoke house and take down a ham of meat he answered them with a curse and said he would not do it to save their lives they then acted in a very insolent manner and finally knocked him down with their guns mrs scarborough became so much exhasperted at their treatment of her husband that she struck one of the yankees in the face she supposes that they must have also struck her as she afterwards found her arm very much bruised but in the excitement of the broil neither she nor her husband knew it it appears from mr gordon's account that the people in his neighbourhood were struck with a panic many of them moved from their houses some into the swamp and others stayed in some cars on the railroad running them as far down the track as they could the people in monroe were also exceedingly alarmed mr gordon says that the yankees left a good deal of meat and some blankets which they had taken at the house of an old man in his vicinity telling him to keep them until they came back but those who had been robbed of these things were taking them back again willie said he heard of the yankees insulting several ladies and burning a great deal of corn in prairie merouche a place some fifteen or twenty miles back from monroe and near oak ridge they also destroyed the distillery of a whiskey maker somewhere about there he had had all his whiskey rolled out into the woods and his negroes and horses hid away they made him tell where they were and opened all his whiskey barrells and took away his horses and negroes but little sympathy is felt for him and the respectable portion of the community are heartily glad that the distillery is destroyed but i must leave the yankees now to note the course of our affairs since last saturday morning it rained at times through the whole day when the darkness was beginning to come on lieut picot rode up and asked if he and his friend lieut flournoy could stay all night they were running from the yankees for there was an alarm spread in monroe saturday that they were coming back and it produced as much excitement as their actual coming had done this lieut picot is a member of the court martial now sitting at monroe and he stays at judge lemmy's when mrs lemmy was out here she talked of him a great deal of how polite he was and how modest and agreeable of course being so favourably prepossessed with him and the evening being so rainy mother took him and his friend in father and lieut stubbs returned about dark and there was a mr whyte here who lives in trenton and had charge of maj buchner's wagons so we had quite a house full again this lieut flournoy is a cousin of a lieut lucian flournoy who was at monroe a year ago and who was a great beau and favorite of the ladies he was an old acquaintance of dr young's family i had met him several times and had heard of him a great deal i liked this one quite well he is a young married men seemed very fond of his wife and child and was quite social and agreeable he manifested a feeling heart when speaking of the evils of war and the suffering of the soldiers poor fellow he looked quite shabby his pants were faded quite green and his worn coat was closely buttoned up he is not one of our bright gray coated officers but this disposed me to like him lieut picôt we found as mrs lemmy had said a modest polite young man he is a brother of a capt in harrison's old regiment who is very much respected and he is a nephew of mr faiz of whom we heard so much from mrs dwight lieut picôt was acquainted with mrs dwight they remained here until monday morning as the weather continued cold and rainy and lieut picôt was expecting a chill sunday he remained in bed all day however and kept it off lieut stubbs left sunday morning i had never seen him before he was out here this time though i had seen and liked mrs stubbs i like him so much he is quite handsome and has such an air of frankness and honesty with much good nature he is very natural and agreeable in his manners and conversation so that one readily feels at ease with him he called again wednesday evening to get his saddle bags which he had left here on sunday capt reynolds called here tuesday afternoon was on his way from homer where he had been to try and get a place for his son's wife she lives near alexandria and the last time the yankees were there they took all her jewelry and her's and her children's clothes and threatened their lives so that she is naturally anxious to get to a place of security capt reynolds looks very very badly he drinks to great excess and will i am afraid fall a victim to his intemperance he spoke of mrs veader's death as a loss only to those she left a gain to her he had recently heard from his son who is first lieut in capt williams company of engineers he was then commanding the company capt williams having been absent a week or two we have had fine weather since tuesday morning but the roads are of course still very bad shuder bridge is washed away again and the stage is not running i wrote a long letter to miss mary and eva yesterday telling them of the late stirring events lieut stubbs promised to call for it this morning and take it as far as minden as he is going to shreveport mr craig has had a petition for a detail going the rounds of the military authourities for some time and last week it came back with respectfully returned disapproved by gen'l smith endorsed on the back thus the hopes of his family were disappointed he is a miller near here and an industrious honest and patriotic citizen his family is very large and his wife a delicate woman they are entirely dependent upon him for their support mother desired to make one more effort for him and father thought the appeal had better be made to gov allen to exert his influence so i wrote under their direction and in mrs craig's name to gov allen enclosing the petition and lieut stubbs is to carry it i hope it may prove successful as many a detail is made with far less foundation of equity and justice gov allen has shown himself so attentive to the welfare of the citizens and so considerate of the needs of poor women that we may reasonably hope for his favourable influence wednesday feb 15th i have gained an hour this morning by getting up by mistake long before dawn the sun is now just risen it is a beautiful spring morning the sky is so clear the air so soft and the birds sing so sweetly that we quite expect to see the trees in bud instead of quite bare as they are this weather is particularly delightful after the two or three weeks of cold and rain we have had mother has been quite sick ever since saturday her sickness though it proceeded from nothing more than a boil on her nose has kept her in bed for three days the boil caused a great deal of pain over her whole face and head and being accompanied by a very bad cold it was no slight matter mother was much better yesterday and will be up today i hope mr noble our old neighbour was here saturday night he told us that the yankees committed great depredations about bastrop they were very insulting to several ladies but committed no actual violence upon them col benton told mr noble that the yankees stood over mrs benton with a loaded whip and compelled her to unlock all her trunks and drawers they tore up all her clothing and when she at last escaped from them she locked herself up in her room to preserve herself from violence several parties came to her door that night but did not get in mr noble says that none of the people who had shown kindness to the guerillas were robbed at all from which it is supposed that some of them must have been among the yankees mr brinton came up late sunday evening and remained all night while we were at supper we were greatly surprised by the entrance of mr barr he left for homer the next morning i sent a letter to miss mary and eva by him he came up to monroe with a yankee prisoner and obtained permission to go home for a few days father left with mr brinton monday morning for millhaven as mother was sick we were very lonesome indeed i never found mr brinton more than endurable until sunday night he is very self conceited and though he has been south ever since he was twenty he has the manners and accent of a yankee still he is a great talker and talks in a pompous declamatory manner not very agreeable but i believe he is a staunch southern son in his principles and he manifested this in his conversation the other night which makes me like him very much it is so refreshing to meet with a man of good sense who while he sees and deprecates our misfortunes and errors yet believes that we will not be subjugated unless we will it and that reconstruction is only a sophistry which means subjugation there are many rumours now about peace and many hopes i do not feel that there is any prospect of an honourable peace and can of course have no hopes however much i wish it i feel perfectly safe to trust that president davis will never betray the good or the honour of the confederacy they say that commissioners are passing between washington and richmond and there are many rumours about that old delusion recognition and intervention from england and france we shall see father came home last night i was rejoiced to see him for i was afraid he would not come until today i received a letter from miss mary and eva last night they are well and contented miss mary has commenced taking music lessons says she thinks she has no talent for music but is determined to practice her finger ends off if need be for mother and i they have had much bad weather and they say have gone to school through cold and rain i must put up this and go and see about breakfast as it is getting on toward eight o'clock
march 2nd 1862 sunday as yet we have heard of nothing but reverses fort donnelson was taken by the 17th last month since that nashville has been surrendered by the civil authorities and now columbus is threatened by an army of 100,000 men rumours are all around we know nothing certainly except that the yankees are advancing and our troops retiring it is hinted that only enticing the enemy forward i hope it is so i cannot be sure of anything except that i would rather die than see our armies humiliated by flight our country ruined by submission submission why do i speak that disgraceful word why do i think it for a moment victory or death is our only alternative worse than death would be our conquest by the yankees that is now the most hateful word in our language father has been in new orleans all the week we expect him back tonight friday was a fast day the first act after president davis inauguration as president of the permanent government was to appoint a day of fast and prayer it was kept very strictly in monroe all the stores and other places of business was closed and the church was crowded we fasted here had no dinner at all no meat for breakfast school was also suspended mother and grandma went into monroe to attend church grandma remained with aunt jane we received mr john green's wedding card today his bride was miss skipwith of mississippi we have been having delightful weather for the past week yesterday the first day of spring was bright and warm i walked down to the bayou and gather some sassafras and haw flowers the little violets are beginning to peep out in all directions peach buds are about to burst and nature all around prepares to burst her fetters this morning we were waked up by a severe hailstorm it was of slight duration and was succeeded by rain it cleared off before dinner and now the wind whistling round the corners the fires upon the hearths and the sounds of the axe at the would pile do not seem much like spring vegetation not far enough advanced for this cold weather to do more than retard its progress among all the sad news we hear lately there is one thing which has not yet suffered reverse this is the wonderful little sumter the exploits of the gallant captain semnes still call forth our admiration lincoln's large staunch war vessels cannot succeed in capturing the leaky little craft or prevent her destroying their laden schooners first in one hemisphere then in the other she carries her bright flag unsullied sunday evening march 16 1862 we still hear bad news or at least we have heard of no decisive victory there in a report that gen'l price has defeated the yankees in arkansas but everything about it is vague one thing we are sure of our battering ram the virginia sunk one of the blockading ships on the potomac last week and badly disabled two more rumours of an approaching battle on the potomac reach us virginia is under martial law also memphis and new orleans the whole country is excited and every body astir two companies are forming here to leave in the course of two weeks mr pierce has joined one of them a cavalry company he will go if he can get a horse john and angus ridgill leave for the war this month perhaps have left already john wrote to ask willie to join them willie's health was much better and he concluded to go and wrote john word that he would father was away at that time but has returned he thinks of getting an appointment from government if he does he says willie must stay at home if he does not he will wish willie to go i don't know what to wish i can't bear the thought of willie's going away and yet i am anxious for him to serve his country i feel sad all the time my only comfort is in my bible where we are told that if we continue patient we shall at last be victorious when i think what a glorious cause we have or how much less we have suffered than other nations who were still victorious i feel strengthened but sometimes we cannot think of all this father left us last sunday intending to go to new orleans and richmond before he returned but last night he came back very unexpectedly he said that the heavy rain we had last week washed some of the eastern railroads so that he could not go on so he thought he would spend sunday with us he leaves tomorrow again he may perhaps be appointed by government to build forty miles of railroad as a connecting link between selma and the southern road if he does he will be away from home all the year we received a letter from captain marks last week telling us what he wished for the company's summer clothing mother is trying to get the cloth we shall soon be very busy we keep on studying steadily i do not learn as fast as i wish but i am too impatient i do as well as i can expect the weeks pass away so quickly it seems to me i do so little sunday night march 23rd 1862 we are sitting up tonight thinking that perhaps father may come and as i am not sleepy i take the opportunity of writing a little when father left he expected to be gone three or four weeks but was detained at desoto by the high water the river has been rising for some time and now threatens to overflow father wrote to mother friday saying that if he could arrange his business so he would come home and spend sunday with us he wrote again yesterday saying he could not leave as the water was over the track in some places and we must not expect him till he wrote again but mother thought perhaps he might come tonight we have a very cold windy week wednesday night we had a perfect storm of wind and rain many trees were torn up and blown down since that we have an almost constant cold wind grandma spent the week in monroe came home today willie had three chills this week but he is taking cholagoque again and will have no more i hope we have not yet heard any news of importance from the war mr pierce was here this morning the company which he joined has broken up he has not decided yet whether to join the other company which is made up or go and join the blues sunday march 30th 62 father returned wednesday night but left again this evening he has just gone this time i hope he will not be delayed for i hate to have his absence in anticipation the river is now at a stand i hope it will soon fall major bry and miss hannah spent the day with us there is no news of importance from the war mr pierce is here this evening we have had delightful weather for the past week everything looks lively and beautiful nearly all the trees are dressed in tiny young leaves and the dogwood begins to look quite white though the flowers are none of them fully matured willie has not had a chill since saturday if he will only continue his cholagoque he will fully recover angus and john ridgill have gone to the war
wednesday march 4th 1863 i have neglected my journal very much indeed lately i do not know why it in but i have become very reluctant to write at all lately except to miss valeria i suppose it is in some degree owing to my corresspondence having been so very irregular lately here it is the fourth day of spring and i have not yet welcomed it in my journal though i have longed for it so much for i feel as if the painful thoughts and sad remembrances which this winter has brought will be in some degree dissipated by the mild air and flowers of spring for who can be entirely sad when nature is bursting into life and beauty around oh how lovely is spring i am almost sorry to see her development so quickly does she pass away merging all her bright freshness into the voluptuous dreaminess of summer the peach trees have been in bloom for some time and the oak and dogwood buds are plainly visible but the air has lost that delicious warmth and softness which it had a few weeks ago it is really cold this morning last night we had a heavy frost willie went into town yesterday and procured seventy two trees from dr calderwood's nursery they are nearly all apple trees only eight pears he is going to set them out this morning mother sent to mrs bry's last week and got some cuttings and some flowers which are planted in our little garden our heliotropes have all come out beautifully and my geranium is getting to look quite green again i had them all carried up stairs last week mr myrick spent the day with us sunday the 22nd feb'y left for georgia the next week we sent a number of letters by him he said that father would probably return with him in april so we now look forward anxiously to april it is now three months and a half since father left us he was never absent so long at a time before julia compton spent last week in our neighborhood she stayed three days with me the rest of the time with carrie and the miss dawsons we had quite a gay time took several horseback rides and spent one evening all together at mrs dawson's miss mary compton spent monday with us went home in the afternoon i promised to go up there friday and stay till saturday evening willie is getting quite fond of the young ladies company enjoys his rides with them very much and i observe he is more scrupulous about his dress than formerly mrs brinton spent yesterday here with her youngest son this is miss mary's birthday so we have no school she received no present except a little pincushion from eva which pleased her very much not only on account of the present itself but the spirit which prompted it i fancy sometimes that eva is becoming less fretfull and bad tempered though at other times i think i am mistaken patience and time these are the only remedies i finished corinne this morning it is indeed a beautiful book we are all reading home influence and mother's recompense together have nearly finished it i received a letter from miss valeria week before last answered it by mr myrick every letter from increases my love and esteem for her oh if i could but see her even for a little while it would be such a pleasure i have another of those painful and troublesome boils under my arm it is almost well now march 12th 63 we have just received a letter from father it is the first we have had in more than a month he is quite well or was on the 6th of february the date of his letter and i thank god for that but he says his duties are very arduous and very annoying and that he has been more than once tempted to resign but was withheld by a sense of duty he says that he had been expecting for two weeks to leave for home but had not been able and did not that expect to start for a week he must have been again prevented oh how we long to see him it is so cold today and has been so since monday it is hard to bear after the delightful weather of last week we were at mrs compton's yesterday evening rode back home by starlight with miss fanny dawson and virginia and adam young march 23rd 1863 i have at last paid my long promised visit to the bayou last monday willie drove me to mrs willson's and leaving me there went on to bastrop i was a little anxious about my welcome for i had not seen any of them for several months and i was not quite sure how they would receive me but they all welcomed me very warmly indeed i had intended to return on tuesday with willie but mrs willson and her daughter insisted that i should not and i found them so agreeable that i consented to prolong my visit until thursday morning i will write an exact account of every day for i have an hour before school time and i feel quite like writing monday afternoon miss julia willson miss tabitha scarborough and i went to ride on horseback we had a delightful ride along the side of the bayou which is now very high but oh how i missed my dear little mollie as soon as i mounted it seemed so natural to give her the rein and say get up mollie but instead of her charming galop my pony paced along very quietly and pleasantly we rode about four miles to an indian mound where we dismounted tied our horses and ascended the mound it is situated just at the mouth of bayou de leard and we could look down the river some distance the water looked still and beautiful in the light of the setting sun over the narrow neck of land just opposite we could see the overflow a watery expanse stretching away as far as the eye could reach it is the plantation of mr goodrich and his house is just opposite the mound he sent over a flat for us and we went over to his house for a few moments here we saw mrs scarborough who was spending a few days there crossing over again we rode home did not reach there till it was quite dark on dismounting from our horses we were met by dr strother he greeted me warmly as miss sarah tabitha and i exchanged glances i had just said that evening that i liked to be called miss wadley by new acquaintances dr cummings and mr shields were in the house they took tea and spent the evening i found their company quite pleasant i do not like dr cummings much nor do i think him handsome perhaps i expect too much from him but there is an expression of effeminacy and indolence about his mouth that i cannot like we did not leave the parlour until twelve o'clock that night the gentlemen remained at mrs willson's and had a great deer hunt the next day tuesday julia tabitha and i went into monroe we called at mrs judge bry's saw mrs mason she has the most emaciated form and deathly expression i ever saw on any face we dined at mrs stevens there was a meeting of the d d d's a young ladies company in monroe in the afternoon after which we went home to mrs willson's while were disrobing we heard the voices of judge scarborough and mr shields in the hall below they had just returned from the hunt we soon descended and heard all the particulars how they had been several times nearly mired up in the woods how the party had become separated and lastly how mr shields had seen ten deer and shot several times without killing one about half past seven or eight the two doctors arrived in wofull plight and without having had any better success than the others they soon left for town but mr shields remained all night wednesday morning we spent quietly at home i taught tabitha and agnes willson how to nett they were both very much pleased with the work in the evening we rode on horseback again we went through some beautiful woods where beneath the gray moss which hung from all the old trees there were many beautiful dogwoods and haw trees and some jasmines and honeysuckles in full bloom we gathered some for mrs willson who is passionately fond of flowers but these flat woods cannot compare with my beautiful hills we returned from our ride very much fatigued and putting on our calico dresses went into the parlour where i threw myself on one of the sofas which stood invitingly near and the others established themselves comfortably in some arm chairs around in a few minutes mrs willson and julia drew up the card table and insisted that i should join them in a game i do not like cards and am perfectly ignorant of the science of playing but i was obliged to take my seat at the table we had just commenced playing when we heard a knock at the door and soon the servant brought up word that several gentlemen were in the hall this of course created quite a confusion mrs willson went down and received them soon they were ushered in and i was introduced to lieuts cobb and flournoy and capt martin the evening passed very pleasantly i was very much pleased with lieut flournoy found him very agreeable though his attentions were much confined to julia the gentlemen left late and my head was not laid on the pillow till one o'clock again thursday morning we went in to mrs stevens soon after i arrived there a steamboat came up with a band of music on board and was received with shouts of joy we could not imagine what produced so much excitement mary was not at home mrs stevens said i must go up on the balcony upstairs i was reluctant to do so as there was a wounded soldier up there but she insisted and i followed her lieut lacy was on the piazza his leg supported on a chair he was all afire with excitement at hearing the martial music we soon found that all the music and excitement was caused by the fact that gen price was on board mary soon returned and we were all talking about the boat when mr wade and dr cummings came over to see her pass up we went out on the piazza and the doctor pointed out the gen'l to us he waved his hand very politely dr cummings told us that julia and tabitha went on board with him and were introduced to the gen and his son in the afternoon mary and i took a delightful walk up the river bank it was just about sunset and the river was beautiful the banks too looked so green and all the trees were clothed in the soft verdure of spring mary and i were filled with calm happy delight we better acquainted in that one short walk than we would in days of indoor life i like mary very much she is so good in her family and yet she is by no means dull as some very good people are on our way home we stopped at mrs mcguire's mary's great aunt and saw some beautiful flowers mr ray came in while we were there he enquired after father as every one did who saw me mary and i had quite a race home and in consequence our dress was somewhat disarranged my hair was all down and we remarked while smoothing our hair that we hoped no one would come in during the evening as we did not feel like dressing come said mary it is so warm let's go out on the gallery oh yes i said and we went out into the hall who should we see but dr strother standing quietly in the door i think he must have heard our conversation for we spoke in quite a loud tone of voice at first sight of him we stood still in surprise and then we all three laughed of course an evening thus commenced could not but be spent agreeably the doctor stayed till quite late i was very much pleased with him he has such frank pleasant manners and converses so agreeably friday miss sarah garrett spent the day at mrs stevens just as we were rising from the table mrs knox came up to visit mrs stevens her horses had run away about two miles from monroe and could not be stopped until just as they were dashing into the livery stable they were caught by the keeper miss knox her daughter came up soon after she had been riding on horseback and was much frightened about her mother friday evening was spent very pleasantly in conversation and singing we walked out on the river bank after supper the sky was bright with stars which were reflected in the glassy surface of the waters while a house on the opposite bank was brightly reflected with all it's lights and seemed to the excited imagination a beautiful palace on the shore of some peaceful lake saturday mary and i went out to make some purchases intending to go down to major bry's afterwards but we met him and he told us that his little grandchild had died that morning and that he was just making preparations for it's burial so of course we did not go we called at mrs wade's spent a very pleasant hour in her company and then about twelve o'clock mary miss knox and i went to mrs garrett's where we met miss fanny hardy and at dinner col bartlett the commander of this post who supersedes gen blanchard and capt thomas miss hardy is a very pretty young lady very much like mrs drake in her manners in the afternoon we were sitting in the parlour when mrs garrett's little son came in and whispered to his mother mr wm wadley has come i did not hear what he said but i did hear mrs garrett when she exclaimed miss wadley your pa has come i bounded to the door all agitation and delight what was my disappointment when i saw willie instead of father he said he did not wish to hurry me but we would not have time to got home if we did not leave soon so we took leave of mrs garrett and returned to mrs stevens immediately here i found a most beautiful bouquet which mrs wade had sent me i bade all goodbye and left after obtaining a promise from mary that she would come and spend a week with me as soon as miss knox left her i had passed my week very pleasantly and gaily but i was glad to be at home again and see all the loved ones around me and oh how beautiful my dear old hills look to me all clad in the soft verdure of spring how dear this oakland is to me almost as dear as our old home from the west windows of the hall the prospect is perfectly beautiful i ask no other happiness than such a home as this surrounded by my loved ones and feeling the pure joy of a heart and conscience at peace with god and the world sunday i was very much fatigued and had a bad head ache in consequence of the late hours and excitement of the past week mother willie and eva went to church and i spent the greater part of the morning in reading and resting about one o'clock johnny davis and berk seale rode up they remained until the afternoon johnny davis said he was going to vicksburg on monday and would take any letters i had to send i wrote to father and to miss valeria i had just received a letter from miss valeria saturday morning i know she will be surprised to get an answer so soon tuesday march 24th i commenced my school duties again yesterday i am so glad to see that the usual routine of home does not appear distasteful to me after my week of pleasure i had feared it would i was busy all the evening in setting out violets a little before sunset eva and i walked over to mrs dawson's found miss fanny in bed she has been very sick mrs dawson asked me if the country did not appear dull and lonesome after having been in town i said oh no the hills appear more beautiful than ever to me and our place seems a perfect elysium a second paradise mrs dawson looked quite amazed i received a note from miss mattie newcomb yesterday evening it was full of high sounding phrases and affectionate endearments she wishes me to come up and spend a week with her i shall not do so as i cannot spare another from my school but i will go up there and spend the day soon it is now raining commenced sunday evening and has continued at intervals ever since wednesday march 25th yesterday evening miss mary lory and i went out to ride on the way back an old gentleman rode up behind us miss mary and i were trying to avoid the mud and he addressed us telling us there was no danger of miring we then rode on faster and left him behind but hearing him speaking to loring and thinking it looked impolite to leave him in that way we checked our horses he soon came up by my side and said col wadley's family i presume i said yes he then said i saw your father in jackson the other day of course then we were all excitement i asked him if he was acquainted with my father oh yes he said i am mr coleman coleman i repeated col coleman from the swamp he said yes the same i had met him before but should never have recognised him again he said father was well but as busy as a bee he could not possibly come home now mr floyd was camped at mr noble's place and he called to col coleman we then came on home met a negro man who usually brings letters from the railroad asked him if he had brought one yes m'am who was it from mr wadley i believe m'am i loosed the rein on mollie's neck and in a few moments was at home and reading the letter father said nothing about coming home i cannot wish him to take all the fatigue of crossing the swamp now but it is hard for him to be so near us and not to see him mr floyd stayed here last night he and willie had early breakfast this morning willie left for the swamp mr floyd for texas we expect willie back friday monday march 30th 63 when willie returned on friday he brought us a letter from father it was dated vicksburg and was written in such haste that we could hardly read it father says he cannot possibly come home now every moment is busily occupied and it would take so long to cross the swamp mr dawson brought the letter he says father was well mr dawson there is great risk in crossing the swamp now of being taken by the yankees it was with difficulty he escaped them he also says that the poor soldiers in vicksburg are suffering very much for want of food their bread is little better than pounded corn and their meat they will not eat it is beef and nothing but gristle oh how my heart bleeds for them and it might all have been averted if proper steps had been taken a month ago i feel so utterly powerless to do anything for them but if i can do nothing else i can bear without murmuring the great trial of my father's absence i know he is doing all he can for them friday was fast day we kept fast and i attended church in the morning no work was done by the field negroes all day mother had a severe sick headache friday and saturday yesterday it changed very cold indeed and last night was like winter saturday night we had a very high wind which blew down many trees there were three large trees one oak two hickory blown down down in the grove back of the house
friday march 4th 1864 willie returned very unexpectedly last night he had sent a note to me in the evening saying that he would not be able to come before his next trip on the boat and that we must send antony down with his clothes but last night after supper we heard his well known whistle and his walk walk to pompey the government clerk in monroe had received news that the yankees were coming up to harrisonburg and that he must move the government stores from monroe a few miles back in the country willie left quite early this morning on this service may be back tonight i hope the yankees will not come up as far as monroe our troops will be obliged to retreat i suppose there are so few of them we hear something about an attack on mobile by land and water simultaneously but it is only a rumour dr furness came over last night we were just finishing supper and as father and i had been playing chess our nearly finished game was left on the stand as i was putting the men away dr furness naturally said something about playing chess and father proposed we should take a game i checkmated him whether by his indulgence or not i don't know today is miss mary's sixteenth birthday and the children have begged a holiday so i am free to follow my own devices i finished the last volume of cosmos yesterday have been more than a year reading it it has given me a great deal of pleasure and information though there are several parts which i cannot now understand by reason of my imperfect knowledge much that he says about magnetism was beyond my range and about geology too i mean pure geology the names of the different kinds of rock and their classification but there is one thing the book has done for me without doubt it has made me feel a sincere respect admiration and if i might so far presume a love for its authour the very name of humboldt seem grand to me now that i have finished cosmos i shall read more in my french than i have lately done and i hope soon to commence my blair's rhetoric that has been tantalizing me on my shelf for so long the study of language and of composition is delightful to me wednesday march 16th i did not know till just now that it had been so long since i wrote here i don't remember all the remarkable events that have taken place in that time and shall not attempt to recount them mary stevens and miss sarah garrett made their long anticipated visit to me on thursday i was very glad to see them and enjoyed the day very much mary took me quite by surprise by saying that i was to go home with her however on considering that it was thursday and that i should enjoy a visit to town very much i concluded not to oppose her design we had a delightful ride in the evening was springlike and i felt happy in the enjoyment of the ride and the blue sky and the bright air and the pleasant face opposite me we called at mrs seale's found them all at home and saw mrs seale's flowers which are coming out beautifully i spent a good deal of my time in town in visiting had several calls to return went with mary to her french lesson one morning and wished more than before that the teacher were nearer us they have only four in the class and i like the mode of teaching very much i learned one or two little things about the pronunciation in that short time i was under the influence of the light at any rate my resolution to continue improving myself was very much quickened i went to see mrs dortch the morning before i left town i have not lately passed a pleasanter hour then the one spent in her bright room she was so agreeable and so cordial miss barnes too i was glad to see mrs dortch's little johnny is indeed a sweet little follow with his fair hair and skin and bright blue eyes played chess while i was in town with john stevens he don't know how to play very well but of the two games we played he was victorious in one father came in for me monday morning called for me after dinner but just as i was running across the hall to get ready miss lou hanna came to call on me and she remained so long that it was not until quite dusk that we arrived at home the place looked very pleasant in the moonlight and the house seemed so large and homelike i was glad to be at home again though my visit had been so very pleasant i forgot to say that i went to church on sunday heard good and fervent sermon from mr mcguire mary's grandfather it is the first time i ever heard him preach he was with as at grandma wadley's burial and i thought of that when i heard his voice in prayer i could not restrain my tears when he prayed for all our absent friends wherever they may be or whatever their situation there was one in my thoughts as she ever is where is she where is she on my return home i found a note waiting me from mrs morancy affectionate as her letters always are i have some friends that i know love me very much and i return their affection but i can always think of some friend they love better than me with valeria i am esteemed and loved more than any other friend she has or can have she wrote me those words and i believe them as much as i believe that long before she told me that she was my one friend we commenced school again yesterday all the children did well and they have done so today too except that i had a little bit of trouble about loring's reading he is now reading abbott's history of alexander it is true there are a good many long words in it but with a little help he can get over them quite easily and i think the book much better for him than these little reading books we have he was very much annoyed before school from the consequences of a fit of disobligingness he had and when i called him to read began to talk about how everybody was cross to him and how he would not be kind to him if i would always be encouraging sister may to be cross to him and finally begun reading by jerking out each word in a slow sullen tone which is peculiarly irritating but after talking to him a little while and telling i should certainly speak to mother if he did not improve in his manner of reading he commenced and read five or six pages well and with great interest his usual lesson is three pages and when he had finished that i was about to close the book what was my delighted surprise to hear that he wanted to read more it was the story of bucephalus and he was much interested speaking of bucephalus reminds me that willie has sold or rather swapped his fine horse caesar with dr temple he won't let the dr come near him i was so much amused the morning after willie sold him miss mary and i were sitting in the parlour reading when them came a hello at the door miss mary went out and found a negroe boy with the petition please ma'am dr temple says will mr wadley please send a hand up there to help catch that horse mars willie sold him this morning dr temple had bought the horse but he had not bought antony willie has lost his pony he went off the boat one night and before willie could get out went off in a run he thinks he will certainly get him again i hope so he is such a fine pony and so necessary to willie now we have not seen willie since early thursday morning when he left for columbia on the twilight we think it came up this morning and hope to see him tonight it seems like so long since he was here dr furness was over last night appeared quite pleasant more so than i have ever seen him before miss kate brantley and her sister mrs heard were here thursday night i was away and did not have the pleasure of seeing them the weather is chilly and quite windy like march but all the oak tress are in bloom the dogwood begins to look white on the hillside and the jessamine wreaths perfume the hollows spring is near at hand yesterday i saw one of my heliotropes peeping up it's little green leaves in the garden friday march 19th 64 we were surprised yesterday evening by a visit from dr mcdonough we were all in the parlour father and i were engrossed in chess mother was knitting and miss mary playing and singing for the courier who had asked to hear her when the knock came mr haddox who was sitting next to the door answered it i thought i knew the voice but would not say so i have been so often mistaken in voices and steps lately we were all heartily glad to see the doctor he looked jaded and ill no wonder had been riding a day and a night in the stage he is going down to delhi to settle up his business with mr smith's wife mr smith has gone away to vicksburg and is in the employment of the yankee government dr mcdonough feels very badly about it they were intimate friends we kept the dr with us all night he retired early on account of his headache and fatigue eva miss mary and i were sitting alone in the parlour when we heard the galop of a horse we cried out willie has come and ran to meet sure enough it was he he looked very well but was troubled at not having found pompey is afraid he has lost him altogether willie is now performing the duties of clerk of the boat the steamboat twilight in addition to his other work i am sorry he has this last place i am afraid it will not prove an elevating one i am not afraid of willie's taking any of the vices of gambling or drinking or smoking or anything else like this he has a natural dislike to all but the tone of his companions mind and manners can scarcely fail of having some effect upon him i love him so well my dear kind brother he left immediately after breakfast this morning don't know when he can come back the yankee gunboats are in red river and the twilight keeps her steam up ready to run up to camillen if they approach nearer we hear rumours of a threatened attack on alexandria and of a great victory gained by lee over butler in virginia but everything in uncertain tuesday march 22nd we have such dreadful weather since i wrote last it commenced on saturday which was a dull gloomy day and quite chilly but saturday night we had a most violent storm of wind and rain and the morning dawned cold and cloudy growing more cloudy and cold as the day wore on with occasional falls of rain the night came on with a cold slow rain which increased to a storm monday it was very cold all day and about dusk we were electrified by the sight of falling snow this changed into a driving sleety rain but this morning when i rose from my bed rose who was making my firs said look out of the windows miss sarah see how pretty it is it was pretty indeed but the cold beauty of winter it was not yet light and white patches of snow gleamed here and there down and up the hillsides wherever a few boards or logs furnished a resting place the roofs were all white and by the glimmering twilight i could an the snow lay on the great arms and tiny twigs of the oaks forming a contrast to the yellow blossoms which i knew were there though i could not see them snow on the 22nd of march i could scarcely believe it as the morning light advanced the dogwoods and the snow vied with each other in whiteness but the sun rose clear and brilliant to our glad vision so long wearied with clouds and darkness and the snow disappeared like frost work the dripping from the roofs sounded like rain it was so strange and pretty to see the clear fast falling drops shining and changing in the sunlight it is not warm yet but is pleasanter than it has been for several days once more we all say oh i hope this will be the last of the cold weather i hope it so much bright beautiful spring when will you come again how long will you sicken me with hope deferred all winter i have sighed for spring but i am afraid we shall see her shorn of some of her many beauties when she comes at last this alternately cold and warm weather is spoiling all the flowers as well as fruits willie spent the night with us saturday was obliged to go to fordsville on government business sunday morning but came back to dinner father is making some gloves for himself out of some very nice buckskin which he had dressed on the place i think he will have a very comfortable serviceable pair of gloves i wanted to help him make them and had intended to do so but a most inconvenient rising came on my thimble finger saturday and i have not been able to sew any since i have been making a pair of corsets lately which have taken a good deal of time and trouble i cut them out from a pair of mother's without ripping them up and think they fit very well taking this into consideration they will fit very nicely indeed when i have made a little alteration which i contemplate we have commenced reading dickens old curiosity shop aloud i like it very much but should like it better were the horrid disgusting quilp left out or at least modified are there really any such monsters in mind heart and person all combined i hope not i cannot believe there are what a beautiful story is that of little nell and the old man so pathetic in it's simplicity we have only read a little way in the book have been so much interrupted find it growing in interest as the different characters come on i have another story book on hand now two at a time is more than enough but this is a borrowed book and i have to take it now or not at all it is say and seal by the author of the wide wide world and written in much the same style simple quiet and religious throughout i like it and think it does me good though there amy be some faults in style and wording i am sure the book shows throughout an earnest desire in the authouress or authouresses to benefit her readers both for time and eternity there are many books of which we cannot say as much friday march 25th 1864 the evening of good friday i spent the morning as usual in school george and loring both gave as some trouble and tired me very much the dinner bell rang before we were through i took no dinner and after i had finished one or two things in the school room came down here to spend two or three hours alone with my god oh how i feel my negligences and weaknesses and how my trials sink into nothing before the solemn thoughts which this day brings up in my mind yet i am not able to sustain my soul in her flights my flesh so weak and my mind too i have just been walking a little in the garden to rest myself but my head feels so weary mother and i went to spend the day at mrs seale's yesterday i did not want to go but father wished it the wind was high and keen as a sharp sword and it blew directly in our faces so that the ride was very disagreeable but i was very glad we went for we saw willie he was just starting for camden we saw him only a few minutes he looked so well and was so kind expects to leave the boat at camden and return by land it is reported that the yankees will be here before many days but some think they will go to shreveport and leave monroe unvisited was there ever such a dark period in a nation's history before sometimes it seems that all is dark all is east of the mississippi the soldiers are deserting by scores the officers are most of them cowards or knaves and the people seem to have lost patriotism even the shadow of patriotism to be high in rank in this army is almost synonymous for high in corruptness to the east of the mississippi lies our only stay our only hope i hope all from there but we hear nothing but vague rumours i hope strongly but the end seems afar off and in my darker hours i am tempted to believe it uncertain sunday night march 27th 1864 the last hours of easter sunday are passing away it has been a happy one to me the day was beautiful and all through the morning and evening too the wind among the tree tops has seemed to be repeating in glad tones christ is risen christ is risen how can i be thankful enough for this unspeakable gift for the means of grace and for the hope of glory after breakfast the children had gone down into the garden i went there too for a few of the white violets that grow so plentifully near the little water course that runs at the foot of the hill there i found georgie and together we walked up to grandma's grave we sat down on the leaves leaning against a tree and listened to the continual anthem of the wind among the pines my heart was filled with grateful happiness as i listened and as i felt the warm rays of the sun the budding trees and shrubs looked high against the blue sky and the little birds twittered their sabbath songs from branch and twig loring and eva saw us from the garden and came to join us we sat there some time talking of christ and the resurrection solemn but happy themes as we walked slowly to the house we met miss mary and john and stopped to gather some of the little turkey berries at the foot of the beech tree their red colour delighted the little ones my little bunch of violets had been increased by so many and various gifts that i had a pretty boquet when i reached home the morning was spent in reading the service and the bibles and in rest which fell into sleep for about quarter of an hour i found myself refreshed by my little sleep and after dinner read a short sermon then talked and read to the children and then we took our bible and prayer books up to grandma's grave where i read them the affecting story of christ's judgement and crucifixion out of the gospel of st john they learned some verses and then we took a very pleasant walk the sun was enveloped in clouds when we arrived at home and we sat in the hall all together until the cool wind sent us to the parlour a story or two to george and a little reading followed and then the supper bell rang i wish we might spend every sunday as well as this one i am tired though and must put up my book which has now kept me longer than i expected when i began march 31st thursday the month is going out in stormy wind an it came in how it sighs and whistles round the house just as it has done all day blowing the sand and leaves in whirlwinds it seems as if it must blight every bud and blossom but in spite of it spring is now coming in earnest the dogwoods are bleaching whiter and whiter every day and the beautiful and varied green of the young foliage brightens the hillside father and i took a ride yesterday evening gathered some jessamines and i returned with my hands full of the graceful fragrant wreaths i love the yellow jessamine so much i am rejoiced to see some tiny green buds coming out on those i planted in february the buds are coming out on our few rose bushes too and the violets are again blooming if this cold blustering wind will only cease with march and make place for the gentle april showers all will be well i never saw a more disagreeable march there have not been more than three calm days in the whole month today just after dinner i thought we were going to have a violent storm the clouds gathered very darkly in the west and the wind swayed the tall pines like reeds oh how beautiful the yellow oak tops and the fresh green of the gum trees looked against the dark sky i sat by my window dividing my attention between the scene without and lamartine's chute d'un ange after reading a longer time than before i raised my eyes and was dazzled by the glory of the sunshine the clouds were breaking away on every side the blue sky shone in brilliant contrast with here and there a little fleecy cloud i could not see the sun but his beam lay bright an the hillside and glanced upon the waving tree tops and lighted up the mass of dark cloud which still rested on the horizon in a moment there flashed on my soul the beautiful words of job and now ye cannot see the bright light that is in the clouds save the wind passeth and cleanseth them i was so glad for those words then for i was tired and disheartened i had had such a bad time with loring had to take him in school after dinner the first time since last summer i am getting to be quite a milliner if misfortunes should reduce me thus far might set up a shop after a short apprenticeship father and i rode to mrs wynne's saturday evening in the course of conversation she mentioned that she wanted me to fix over her little daughter's hat wanted it turned down like margaret craig's on hearing that it was leghorn i thought i could do nothing with but little mattie's face turned so grave and her mother had such a disappointed air as she said she must smooth out the ribbon and put it on again herself i thought i would try and do what i could i was at work on it nearly all of yesterday afternoon for the ribbon required much smoothing and even washing but after all it looks like quite a pretty little hat now mrs mays asked mother the other day if she would come up and spend the day if i would show her how to sew her palmetto hat that will be equivalent to doing it myself i have read two or three lectures in my rhetoric it so delightful to me i have been playing chess this evening and reading so long in the old curiosity shop that my eyes are quite tired and i feel as if richard swiveller's balmy could descend very gently on my heavy lids
saturday march 4th 1865 i had no idea that i had neglected my journal so long however it is not much matter everything goes on so quietly we have had a great deal of rain it has not been fair for three days at a time in two weeks i have been taking horseback rides on flora whenever the weather and roads would permit i enjoy these rides very much indeed i have been seized with a perfect mania for gardening this spring and am very much impeded in my operations by the wet weather we are having a very late spring the oaks are not yet in bloom my violets are blooming finely and the rose leaves are bursting out i have a lovely pink hyacinth in bloom too and some narcissus my dear geranium is quite dead root and all i have got a cutting from mrs seale which i think will grow i have it in a pot in my room i imagine that i can see the tiny little leaves growing a little i have also a cutting of the lemon verbena on which i see the buds about to burst i sent to mrs willson for the spires she promised me it is in full leaf and the flower buds we developed but she was so kind as to take it up very carefully and i do not think it will feel the transplanting i spend my recess in the morning in the garden when the weather permits and i think with lory's assistance i shall be able to keep it in order prince came home thursday night very unexpectedly to us all he came to bring home willie's mule on account of the prevalence at the glanders among the horses of the company he tried today to swap willie's grey mare with one of the doctors at the hospital but did not succeed he is to go back as soon as he can and take one of willie's mares which is not of much value willie sent me a letter by prince he is quite well and in good spirits and was very comfortably fixed in a house but the company had removed to try and get rid of the glanders the news about peace and the hopes some entertained are all come to nothing i hope it has finally convinced every man of any sense that there is no such thing as reconstruction and i hope that odious word may henceforth be banished from conversation lee is not com in chief of the confederate armies i hope he may prove equal to this situation as he has ever before been equal to his duties we know there must be active operations going on in virginia and so c now and we hear many rumours some favourable others not we know nothing certainly i have great hopes mr templeton was here last night on his way from texas says the roads are very bad the stage has been very much interrupted lately i have not received a letter from miss mary or eva for nearly two weeks i expected a letter from them by capt seale but he stayed so long they thought he would not call and sent their letter by mail capt seale went up to the wedding of miss julia scott and mr groves he returned wednesday evening we sent miss mary a pair of shoes also a calico dress for her and eva which mr gordon got when he was in the swamp father rode all day yesterday in the rain and a great part of today to get willie a round jacket his coat is too heavy for this mild weather wonderful to tell father at last succeeded in getting from the post quarter master capt oliver enough grey cloth for a jacket an pants also seven brass buttons and nine horn ones he got the tailor who is detailed for the regiment to cut the jacket for the moderate price of twenty dollars money was very plenty a year ago but now it extremely scares there is hardly any new issue on this side the mississippi and fears are entertained that we will soon have no currency father has scarcely any money as he can collect none that is owing to the railroad either from the government or from private individuals mr noble is here tonight and i escaped from the parlour to write my long neglected journal i must stop now however as i begin to be sleepy having sat up quite late last night writing to willie and to my dear valeria i could not wait any longer for a letter from her tuesday march 7th i am so very very tired i have commenced to learn to card and spin and i never tried anything as difficult to me or so very tiring i determined to learn some time ago because i thought it had become a duty but i disliked very much to commence and had a very good excuse in the want of spinning wheel and cards now however father has bought me a pair of cards and mrs whyte has lent me a wheel so i went down to mrs mary's yesterday to take my first lesson i was more awkward at carding than i thought it possible to be and little more skilful in spinning i have been at work ever since dinner and have done a great deal better i think i should like spinning quite well if it were not for the time it takes i think i shall advance quite slowly in the study of criticism i think the trouble i have in learning to spin will make me more patient in teaching the children or rather will make me more ready to sympathize with them i never remember having learned anything which was at the same time difficult and discouraging i forget one exception music two soldiers from the other side of the mississippi only a month from richmond took dinner here sunday one was a very good looking and polite gentleman i suppose an officer from the quality of his dress he is going to return in two weeks and promised to call and take letters for us he did not tell us much news said that it was probable that charleston would be evacuated and that a battle would take place near columbia whither gen lee had gone we may look for victory where he is this gentleman came from richmond to jackson by rail road which is better than we thought it is nearly dark and i am so tired i can write no longer i have a boil on my leg in addition to my fatigue and that makes me feel it more saturday march 11th dr mcdonough came tuesday night it was a very pleasant surprise i was indeed glad to see him he is still here and will not leave until monday he sleeps over at the hospital on account of the night mare which he has so badly that he dislikes to sleep alone but he has spent every evening with us it seems like pleasant old times except that miss mary is not here i rode to monroe this morning with father spent a very pleasant hour with mary and mrs stevens the affair of the party which i had some trouble to account for to mother was as i thought easily explained monroe is in great excitement now the rob roy capt griffin's boat has come up laden to the guards with goods and provisions of every kind even things which we could make here the street is full of barrels and boxes and crowds of men many of whom stand gaping and cringing as if they had never seen a boat before and would stoop to anything to get these creature comforts they say that these goods are to be sold freely and openly to all the citizens we hear that an order has come from richmond prohibiting the cotton trade and ordering an investigation of the matter i hope it will be carried out we saw capt griffen this morning he came up to us as we were waiting for the flat said i was riding such a fine horse i ought to send to new orleans for a bridle i told him we could make them at home we have had heavy frost for the last two nights and i am afraid there will be some tonight i hope the cold will be over by tomorrow the river is beautiful now it is unusually high monday march 27th 1865 i have just returned from monroe went in saturday principally to go to church sunday as mr lawson the episcopal minister from bastrop was to be there he was there and i enjoyed the service and the sermon very much after service mrs dortch spoke to me and introduced me to mr lawson and he was very kind and said he would come round and see me in the afternoon he did so and i told him about how i had wished to see him and to enter the church he said he would come down again in about a month and baptize me then he stayed and talked a good while i cannot define my feelings now nor then i was much excited and i am now feeling the effects of it it all seems so strange to me so strange to hear one talk to me upon this subject which has always been wrapped up in my own heart which has been such an ever present thought but seldom or never found expression it is like a precious happy secret which has so long been ours alone that it makes us lonesome to share it with others i know any other course would have been criminal in me with my belief and i humbly i already feel the blessing of my course but there are many other things which make me feel sad now my heart is swelling with tears there are some whom i love so much that do not feel with me on this great subject there are other things too though this is the saddest i never felt so much how much society in estranged from godliness perhaps not the hearts of many of its members but the habits and conversation of society i do not regret those vain things of the world but it is sad to feel alone among those whom we wish were friends i will only try to do my duty to act and speak as my conscience tells me i ought and i must be very careful to keep watch over my own secret sins god knows how many they are oh how can men speak lightly of his name and his worshippers above all how can women women who have so much to suffer who have so much to fear i don't know whether i ought to attribute it all to my religious feelings perhaps it is also much to my secluded life but i find but little pleasure and much embarrasment in general society i do not look for sobriety i do not expect or wish to exclude gayety but is there not some favoured society where gayety may be refined by taste and intelligence and regulated by decorum where wit may be indulged without offending our maker i know it is unreasonable to expect in every one a friend but it seem to me there might be more politeness and as much pleasure if undignified raillery and tasteless nonsense were banished i have not been away from home before since miss mary left i feel very lonely to return and not find her here when i feel thus disappointed in the world heart full of sad and joyful things then i think of all these i am so far from and whom i wish for so much mrs dortch's baby was baptized yesterday she said she wanted me to be it's god mother but did not know i was there mrs dortch is so sweet and good i love her very much i called on mrs jackson and her daughter saturday mrs jackson is a beloved sister in law of mrs morancy i found her and her daughter both very pleasant called a few minutes at mrs bry's to return mrs leighton's book saw mrs willson and miss nannie there was not prepossessed with miss nannie there are many pleasant anticipations among the young people in monroe about a wedding which is to take place next wednesday the parties are miss sarah garrett and captain chambliss it is expected to be quite a gay affair i am not invited cannot imagine the reason mother is quite troubled about it is not enough to affect me it is only a slight perhaps only forgetfulness from one who is nothing to me
monday april 1st 1861 father returned home friday night in a storm of wind and hail the hailstones were very large but fortunately the shower was short and did not damage the fruit at all spring has now ascended her leafy throne and her sway is complete the little blue violets are fast disappearing and all the trees have leaved out almost entirely mr john green the engineer of this road was here saturday night and part of sunday morning all the time i found myself making not perhaps comparisons but comparing him with mr robt or as we say little mr green and i think nearly always excepting of course the point of stature in the favor of the latter i think mr john green not quite so polite certainly not so polished as mr robt but more talkative and easier to become acquainted with altogether the taller mr green has a lighter mind and perhaps less sterling qualities father thinks them both excellent persons and to father's opinion i nearly always lean sunday afternoon we walked up to our place which is now bought and then to dr young's it is so delightful to have a home in such near prospect i am thinking about it nearly all the time they commenced clearing out the undergrowth this morning father willie miss mary lory and i went up there and spent about half an hour in looking at them and directing them how to cut willie seven or eight hands there and the clearing will soon be completed father has drawn the plan of the house it is to be all on one story a hollow square with a court in the centre and piazzas all round inside and out the number of rooms is twenty counting in dressing rooms bath rooms storeroom pantry and so forth father has projected innumerable improvements and beauties to be placed on our two hills i hope they will be realized father left us for vicksburg this afternoon we are expecting aunt jane tonight wednesday april 10th 61 aunt jane has been here nearly two weeks and will probably remain two more since i wrote last we have had a great deal of rain willie went to monroe a week ago today with a team to haul out the boiler for their mill it commenced raining wednesday night rained thursday and poured down thursday night in consequence of this the creeks all overflowed their banks bridges were reported swept away and the mud was perfectly apalling poor willie got wet and cold could not move the boiler more than a mile in two days and thought that he would never attempt to haul a steam boiler again pa was away at vicksburg uncle moses at monroe and we sat here and heard the rain and suffered in think how they must suffer friday the rain held up a little right after breakfast mother went over to mrs adams to help them quilt and aunt jane and i accompanied by loring and eva went down to steep bayou which is just a few steps from here to see how the water had risen we found a cotton waggon and the stage at the bridge in a perfect quondary the first bridge was not overflowed but all the low land around it was inundated the further bridge for the bayou there doubles round and makes an i island was reported to be swept away at length the stage driver plunged in and we seeing the rain coming hurried back into the house all day the rain poured down without intermission though it lightened a very little towards evening we were sitting down quietly after dinner i reading waverly and miss mary and aunt jane listening when we heard a familiar voice holloa whoa we jumped ran out to the door and there was father dripping wet he had ridden all the way from monroe in the rain he went to the fire and we left him to change his clothes hardly had we got out when mrs adams buggy drove up with mother while she was getting out the galloping of horses hoofs was heard and turning round we beheld willie urging mollie to her greatest speed dressed in a thin pair of summer pants and without a coat he dashed into the house and almost his first sentence after saluting us was sadie i have lost your letters they were some which i had sent to be mailed i was too glad to see willie back in safety to care anything about my letters saturday and sunday father remained at home we have had no rain since friday until this morning yesterday we had all just set out to visit our place before father went in to monroe we had passed out the gate and were walking up the road when we met mr raoul we were all perfectly astonished but very much pleased to see him he said that he had come up to vicksburg intending to go out to meridian on the southern road with mr smedes and mr green but that mr smedes had put it off until friday and as he had a spare day he concluded to come out and see us he returned to the house with us and took some breakfast and then we all walked up to the place mr raoul thought it a beautiful situation for a house he and father both went to vicksburg this morning i think this will be a real rainy day it commenced before breakfast and has continued ever since i do not mind it so much now as willie has brought the boiler nearly to the mill but i would rather it would not rain until he had it all the way thursday april 11th ah me shall i ever finish recording the accidents of this unhappy year poor willie is the sufferer this time he has cut his foot not dangerously to be sure but seriously enough to prevent his walking for two or three days he was driving a plank under the waggon wheel yesterday afternoon with the eye of an axe when the helve broke the axe flew off upon a plank and then rebounding cut through his boat and wounded his foot near the joint of the great toe cutting one or two small arteries he immediately mounted a mule and came home when he arrived his foot had bled nearly a quart and was still bleeding profusely his whole boot and the clothes which he had wrapped around were full of clotted blood mother immediately sent for dr white who arrived in a few minutes stopped the blood and bound up the foot it is doing very well now but willie is so restless and anxious to attend to his business that we can scarcely keep him still the boiler is at last at the mill after having been nine days on the way i am not very well all day yesterday that is after 10 o'clock i was confined to the couch with a dreadful headache uncle moses came this morning we expect father this evening i must go now and the papers uncle moses brought he says we are to have war thursday april 18th 61 i am afraid war is inevitable ft sumter is ours by surrender ft pickens has been reinforced and was to be attacked on the 15th the president of the united states has issued a proclamation which may be considered a virtual declaration of war and which must irritate the south he refuses to recognise the claim of the southern confederacy to a place in the family of nations but considers secession rebellion and commands all persons forming this combination to disperse and regain their position as peaceful citizens of the united states in twenty days he says that the rights and property of all peaceful citizens shall be respected this proclamation was issued before the charleston guns had compelled the surrender of ft sumter since then from the tenor of the dispatches we may suppose that lincoln has wavered a little oh how melancholy how melancholy is the state of our country never since the death of cain was such unnatural uncalled for war where is the reason of the north fled she has utterly withdrawn her light what do they purpose what benefits can they have in view that they will introduce all the horrors of civil war into our country think they that they can compel the south into a union which they have so perfidiously disregarded oh rather will every man woman and child perish upon the soil that gave them birth and from which they draw their sustenance rather than call down the curses of our free forefathers upon the degenerate race who could stoop to ask admittance again intoo a union of name when there is hatred and treachery in the hearts of those with whom we have been united my heart shrinks and all my bravery seems to fly when i think of what may come upon us but we are in the right and he who ruleth the earth and who is king however much the people rage together he will protect us he protected our forefathers who in the first revolution a little band of patriots dared to withstand the hordes which englishmen sent to subdue them and though our enemies are greater in number and in resources than we we have truth on our side and truth must prevail recruiting officers are all around the country it is humbling to see them reeling with intoxication and urging with profane tongues the cause of liberty and independence yet these mean instruments must be tolerated for the great end which we have in view mother's half brother horace holton is serving at ft morgan father went to new orleans tuesday he will not return until saturday night mr john green spent the day here sunday and took dinner with us on tuesday the cleaning is still going on up at our place willie's negro men are getting out sills the place looks more beautiful to me every time i go up there which is about once every two day sunday april 21st father returned last night he is looking very well but is not so bouyant as when he went down truly it is a blessing to be allowed to spend our life in those quiet shades especially during such troublous times as these bitter indeed must be that spirit which away from the haunts of men with the never ceasing hymn of the forest swelling and softening around is not soothed out of all but the rememberance of sorrow how the hush of the sabbath has fallen on everything even the birds sing in subdued strains so as not to interrupt the beautiful harmony which the wind makes in the tops of these lofty trees war with all its unutterable horrors is half forgot as i sit quietly in my little room and my heart swells with thankfullness for our blessings not the less intense because it is subdued by the thought that god stands this day the god of battles and the dispenser of justice and that our only reliance is upon him in these quiet moments when faith triumphs over unbelief i can truly say thy will be done oh lord i feel that god rules justly and mercifully a very sorrowful accident happened yesterday to a man who was getting out timber for uncle moses a large limb lodged in a tree and fell upon this man as he was walking under it crushing the bones in shoulder and injuring his head so severely that he died in less than an hour willie and uncle moses have gone to see him buried this morning they say he is a lone man without friends or relatives to care for him but a few short months ago willie himself narrowly escaped a death so sudden and so painful can he ever cease to thank god for his goodness virginia has seceded general scott has resigned his position as commander in chief of the united states army and tendered his services to virginia his native state tennessee has offered us troops the requirements of president davis have been fully met by the confederate states our people have determined to fight to the last and lastly we have right and liberty on our side if war must come we are prepared to meet it father says if he were a younger man he would have been among the first to offer his services to the government as it is if the north prosecutes her madness so far as to enter our country of course he will enroll who knows what may be before us but whatever comes it is woman's lot to wait and pray if i were a man but i am not my spirit of ten makes me chafe at the regulations which it is right a woman should submit to and i will not encourage it by giving way to vain wishes and vauntings if i were a man friday april 26th this is one of my dark days one in which i feel the the burden of humanity pressing too heavily to be borne the future looks threatening the present is clouded with doubt and uncertainty our country is in turmoil and danger and our family seems like a ship floating upon a troubled sea with no particular destination no particular interest in any thing only to keep afloat i know i am doing wrong i know i am murmuring when i should be thanking god for his blessings to us for are we not fed and clothed and sheltered safely are not we an unbroken household band mother father brothers and sisters all are here but oh i am so weak so wicked i struggle against it but cannot overcome when when shall i learn to trust providence when shall i cease to care about the disappointments of this world father returned in safety last night there is no news except that general scott has not resigned nor does he intend to father went to monroe this morning the mississippi is rising great fears are entertained of an overflow
april 13th father has been gone two weeks today and we cannot hope for his return until next sunday the time passes so slowly while he is gone i never can bear for him to be away but i think i feel it now more than i ever did before oh what a time is this the past week has been one of feverish excitement tuesday we received news of a great battle near corinth miss every day since we have been hearing scraps of news from the battle field on wednesday we were triumphant conquerors but the enemy reinforced by sixty thousand fresh troops was preparing to attack us all is uncertainty and dread rumours of every kind are floating around but i believe we must be victorious my heart sickens when i think that under this beautiful blue sky with god's heavensent air breathing warm and fructifying around while the birds sing and the green leaves wave as if to praise their creator thousands of men are mingling in mortal combat and groans and shrieks sounding amid the roar of artillery and the trampling of cavalry the picture is too dreadful how many mothers and sisters wives and children sit in despair or suspense this day oh if there be a retributive justice what shall be the fate of those wicked men who have sent their myrmidons to bathe our land in the blood of it's children but if they die in body their names shall live in our memory and when in after days the stains of blood have been obliterated from the figure of freedom we shall remember and generations after us shall bless those who died for their country willie has gone to monroe this morning to get the news we can scarcely wait for and yet dread his return we have not heard from father since he left the whole country is in such a state of excitement and the railroads so thronged with soldiers that the mails cannot be relied upon sunday april 20th the battle at corinth was another added to our victories but the work is yet but begun ennemies threaten us on every side and we must soon hear of another great battle the yankees have stormed and taken fort pulaski and surrounded island no 10 so that we surrendered we daily of skirmishes and an approaching fight in eastern virginia and of a threatened attack upon new orleans now we need bravery and coolness and now i believe our rulers and our people art showing it gen'l johnston was killed at corinth every one mourns him the conscription law has been passed and thirty days from the time it passed every male between eighteen and thirty five years not legally exempt must be enrolled in defence of our cause we are waiting anxiously for father to return it is three weeks tonight since he left and we have only heard from him once two bridges have been burned on the route and huntsville ala is in the possession of the yankees so that he cannot come by the most direct way willie looks for him with much impatience to decide whether or not he shall go to the war willie says he cannot stay at home though if he applied he could easily get exemption from the conscript law on account of his arm and his ill health i hope the latter is getting better he has not had a chill in a long time this has been quite a cold day fires have been necessary for comfort it rains a good deal last week and this morning cleared off cold it seems as it we shall never have settled warm weather this is easter sunday at the commencement of lent the yankee papers said that in forty days the stars and stripes should float over new orleans their boast has not been verified god grant i may never see the day that such a thing shall happen miss mary's and my little violet bushes bore their first flowers this week april 27th father returned home last wednesday night we were rejoiced to see him he had great difficulty in getting home the roads were so crowded he did not enter a passenger car from the time he left jackson until he returned at one time he found the train under the control of a regiment of south carolinians and he went to the superintendant of the road with whom he was acquainted to try and get a passage the superintendent told him he might go if he could get in so father went back and crept cautionsly into the baggage car where he was unobserved by the soldiers but the col of the regiment was late and when he came the conductor refused to run the train saying that there was danger of a collision so father got out as quietly as he got in and waited till the next day when they took the freight train schedule and went on we have just heard such sad news there are thirteen of the yankee gunboats moored at the new orleans wharf they have given the city four days in which to remove foreign property and residents and women and children the four days will be out on tuesday and what will happen then we cannot tell some say the city will not resist others that it will the forts below the city are still in our possession they keep the transports from ascending the river they say that the gunboats came three abreast gov moore is expected at monroe father left this evening if new orleans is taken he will not go there of course mother is busy making up willie's clothes he expects to leave when father returns i sewed on his shirts yesterday it is melancholy work my heart sinks when i think of it but i try to keep brave i received a letter from miss valeria day before yesterday mr mcnair was killed in the battle of corinth also mr richarsdson whom we met at amite horace was killed in a skirmish on the peninsula poor horace i had hoped he would live to redeem the errors of his early life his officers spoke highly of him if new orleans is taken the yankees will probably soon have command of the river i cannot bear to think of it i wrote to miss valeria this morning i felt as if i was writing a farewell and now that the letter is gone it seems as it i were cut off from her never did i feel the value of her friendship as i do now
wednesday april 8th it has been more than a week since i wrote any here and yet the week has been full of events to me we have had school only a few days out of the seven for i have either been visiting or receiving company a great part of the time tuesday i attended a little sociable at mrs dawson's it was very pleasant indeed we passed the evening in dancing music and conversation the young ladies of our circle were all there with quite a number of gentlemen for these times there were lieuts flournoy conrad and holland captains martin and o'ruke and dr's cummings and compton besides adam young and willie wednesday we all took a walk down to the bayou spent an hour or two sitting under the shade of a beautiful beech tree or rambling through the surrounding woods and returned home in time for dinner then the same afternoon we rode in to mrs seale's and came bank by moonlight thursday i believe was spent quietly at home in the afternoon julia compton came over and remained all night mother spent the day in monroe friday morning miss mary and maggie compton and carrie young and adam came over miss mary and maggie had that morning walked down from their place after staying several hours they all julia included went over to mrs dawson's in the evening i was not at all well and lay down several hours saturday miss mary and i were busy nearly all day having upstairs swept and dusted and putting up shades and arranging the furniture in the hall which we shall use as a summer parlour mrs compton had a party of young ladies and gentlemen at her house in the evenings and invited me very cordially but i had several reasons for declining one was that i was not well enough to go i forgot to say that willie left us thursday for a business journey into the back parishes monday i spent the day with a whole party of young ladies at mrs seale's the misses dawson the misses scott the misses frazier and miss slack were there besides mrs seale mrs norris and lucy in spite of all this company there seemed to be a pretty general ennui monday night i was surprised and waked out of my sleep about half past ten or eleven o'clock by some one calling at the front door i sat up in bed half asleep and a little frightened and called out who's there a traveller what do you want i want to stay all night mother said tell him no i called back you can't stay it is too late but i will stay those words were rather alarming but fortunate for my presence of mind mother recognised willie's voice i then said oh willie i know it is you come in we were very much surprised to see him so soon he said he could not buy anything government agents had advertised for every thing and he thought it was wrong to take it from the soldiers who need it so much even if he could get it mary stevens and miss knox spent the day with me yesterday we had a very pleasant day indeed mary and i called at mrs dawson's the young ladies were at home we found miss mary and maggie compton there they had just left our house about an hour or more before mother received a letter from father last monday he was just on the eve of leaving for virginia said he would not reach richmond before the first of may as he had a great deal of business on the road he said he would try and come home about the first of june if the yankees were away from the swamp then it is almost impossible to cross to vicksburg now the yankees have been and are still making demonstrations around richmond madison parish father says he has been trying to get time to write to me but has not been able to do so yet i have not expected it but father is so kind so thoughtfull oh can i ever love him enough i must now close this long journal for we go into school again this morning and i want to read some before i go thursday april 16th have been expecting mary stevens out all the week but she did not come and wrote me today that she could not come next week as she was to have company i have been feeling weak and sad all the time for the last few days suppose my sadness arises partly from the state of my health without being sick at all i find my health is less robust than it has been for a year no wonder i have received letters from several friends during the week one from mary waters this evening she says that miss ginnie has been in new orleans for the last four months that they have only heard from her once she writes that banks is very different from butler encourages every one to express their opininions she is afraid he will convert some by his kindness we received some papers the other day from father containing voorhee's speech it is beautifully written and the sentiments are noble the language is more polished than vallandigham's but not more decided willie saw johnny davis today he says mr myrick is at natchez sick is threatened with typhoid fever i hope he will not have it he is just on the eve of marriage to a young lady in the swamp saturday april 17th we have just received a letter from father he was at augusta was quite well and about to leave for richmond yesterday evening carrie young virginia dawson and i took a ride we met mr kimball a few miles from trenton and carrie asked him to ride with us he did so virginia and i managed it so that they should ride together all the time except a little way from steep bayou coming home when virginia and carrie sang and i rode along with mr k found him quite agreeable and intelligent in conversation eva lory and i rode again this morning i have commenced my morning rides again fancy i can almost feel the improvement in my strength already willie and mr axley went down in the swamp yesterday took two negroes with them to get some corn there was no other way of getting it and so willie ventured though it is rather near the yankees we expect them back monday or wednesday yesterday john was very sick we sent for the doctor he said had inflammation of the bronchial tubes he is much better today has been running about the house all day
april 5th tuesday night i have not had time to write any here since the month came in on the first we had as usual plenty of april fools some very successful others very nonsensical saturday was a very happy day the brightness and the warmth of the weather made us incline to joyfullness and then about ten o'clock in the morning we were delightfully surprised by willie's coming he was in fine health and good spirits and we were so glad to see him in the afternoon he drove me out in the buggy to try his new mare she trotted very well and we took a very pleasant drive indeed loring and i rode part of the way to trenton with willie we were very sorry he could not have stayed all night sunday the weather was cold cloudy and stormy we had a short but beautiful storm of wind and rain in the evening after which the sun set quite clear yesterday we had quite an early breakfast for father to go down to millhaven we missed him very much yesterday and today and were rejoiced when soon after dinner today we heard the buggy willie came with father is going to stay until day after tomorrow when he leaves for homer the twilight is going to be returned to it's owner and willie reports to capt oliver the quarter master at homer i shall thus have an opportunity of sending a letter to mrs morancy i know she will be glad to see willie willie and i took a very pleasant ride together this evening i always enjoy a ride with him so much the woods are beginning to sport their spring robes now the dogwoods which were not blighted by frost are now dazzling white in the sunlight our hillside is brilliant with them the jessamines are falling fast but the honeysuckles are just coming into bloom father brought us some bad news today mr peterson has gone to the yankees i was astonished and sorry to hear it he is not an american and has not been here many years this may be an excuse we have so many disloyal persons amongst us now the public sentiment in louisiana is very much demoralized patriotism is a virtue out of fashion and one that is looked askance at the universal sentiment in that this side of the river at least is lost to us and there is even now and then a low murmur that we will soon be altogether subjugated oh we don't think enough of what subjugation really means far from us be such a thought father says he saw a man today from the other side the river who said that all were hopefull over there and fighting on with a good heart oh how i wish we were there saturday night april 9th 1864 this may prove to have been a memorable day in our lives for today our long deferred fears are realized the yankee gunboats have come up to monroe and the yankee pickets are out an each side of the river we know no particulars as to the number of boats or the men and we can only vaguely conjecture what is the motive of their coming but i must go on and give a connected account of the events of the past few days first wednesday was john's fourth birthday and it was also the day set for shearing the sheep so the children begged a holiday which i was very willing to grant for willie was going into monroe in the morning and i wanted to wash his palmetto hat and do sundry other little things while he was gone the morning passed quickly and pleasantly and the afternoon brought willie with the welcome announcement of a visit from mary stevens and mrs tucker on the morrow thursday morning rose bright and clear and it was only ten o'clock when our visitors came we had a very enjoyable day i am too sleepy now to say any more about how it passed in the latter part of the morning the sky clouded over and soon after dinner the rain commenced and continued all the evening i was very glad of an excuse to keep may all night but while i rejoiced for my own sake felt badly on mrs stevens account for she was alone with james and louis mary and mrs tucker went back early in the morning with an appointment from me to spend the day with her today i worked steadily all day at sewing father's hat but could not quite finish it last night was willie's last night at home and we sat up quite late this morning we were ready for our visit to town soon after breakfast the carriage which father has just mended drove up and willie stood at the door to tell us goodbye dear brother when shall we see him again our hearts would have been sad if we could have foreseen this yankee expedition as it was we thought we should see him soon again and felt quite happy as we drove slowly along in the bright sunshine admiring at every step some new beauty in the opening springs now it was the bright green beech trees now the brilliant white dogwoods or some fragrant clump of honeysuckle and again the glistening green huckleberry leaves or the tiny flowers in the grass thus happily and quietly we rode along until we came to trenton and were greeted by the alarming intelligence that the yankee gunboats were a short distance below monroe we kept on to the lower ferry however left the carriage on this side and crossed the dancing little waves in a skiff went up to mrs stevens found them excited and somewhat distressed james was quite ill had been taken with bleeding at the nose and all efforts to check it had been unsuccessful for several hours it had at last ceased but he was very weak mrs mcguire had gone to the plantation and mrs stevens had no one to advise with i felt quite calm but miss mary was very nervous wanted to come back home immediately after going down town and hearing particulars father thought we had best come back so i got a geranium cutting from may one of the chief objects of my visits and we can back the bright morning had changed to cloud and a cold wind as we drove home we shut one of the carriage windows drew our cloaks closer about us and thus we came on slowly miss mary went to sleep father to reading and i to reverie the way seemed short to me of course mother was much surprised to see us back again and still more so to hear the cause the stage did not go in to monroe this evening was within a few miles of it when they heard the news and turned back the only passenger on board came here to spend the night and from him we heard that the yankees have come lieut pugh has come in since i commenced writing he says there are three gunboats two barges and two transports he is camped very near here tonight with a squad of pickets i am so sleepy i can't write any more i forgot to say in my journal the other day that the couriers left here on the fifth of this month sunday evening april 10th 1864 this has not been at all like sunday fatigued by the excitement and exertion of the past weeks i slept until much later than usual this morning lieut pugh and his brother came to breakfast which was quite late his brother tolerably tall with fair complexion and blue eyes and a pleasant modesty open countenance quite different from lieut pugh who is quite small black hair and eyes and a rather swarthy complexion which however does not give him a manly air his manners are quite pert and somewhat affectedly careless soon after breakfast father had prince make the ambulance ready to drive him in to trenton with the gentleman who stayed here last night his name is j a roberts he is going to virginia where his friends are had been living for a good many years in arizona but took refuge in texas soon after the war commenced his health is very bad and he shows it he had such a large heavy blanket woven by the narvahoe indians it is as thick as an ingrain carpet and very prettily striped with white black and blue it was large enough for two blankets being sewn in the middle he said it was too heavy for him and gave half of it to father it is quite an acquisition so good in travelling the whole blanket before it was ripped weighed forty five pounds father asked the gentleman to write to uncle david after he got into mississippi or georgia and tell him that we were well he said he was not willing to take any letters in case of being searched by the yankees wanted to try and get them to take him dawn in one of their transports we grew very impatient as the hours passed on to one o'clock it was nearly two when father came accompanied by a strange man and with his hands quite bloody we were all excitement until he could sit down and tell us the story he said he had gone on very quietly until he nearly reached trenton there mr craig who was very close behind called out that he heard the yankees were coming up to trenton and he turned round and came back home father however thought he might as well go on and did so when he arrived opposite mrs seale's he saw a party of yankees thirteen in number with some uncommissioned officer at their head they were talking to a knot of ladies among whom were mrs seale and lucy father stopped then too and the officer began to ask him if he had seen a confederate officer mounted on a white horse pass up the road father told him he had not seen a white horse since he left home it appears that a captain brigham said to be a bravo sort of a man had been cavorting round below trenton in sight of the gunboats had been seen from them and was the cause of this party having come on shore after speaking to the yankee a little while father asked mrs seale if she would not like to take a ride down to the monroe ferry she took her bonnet and went with him father did not go over to monroe left mr roberts at the ferry and returned up to trenton when he got up into the town he found that this party of yankees were going into the stores and houses not private dwellings searching for this captain brigham and for arms they found some old muskets and some rusty swords and two kegs of powder went into the post office and took out all the letters except those addressed to ladies a rare act of courtesy indeed father stopped up in trenton sat there in the ambulance to see what was going to happen them was a mr turner in the post office who had come down to trenton that morning with his buggy they took his buggy to carry their arms and powder down to their gunboats with mr turner asked them to send it back they said they would not but if he chose he might ride down to the boat and bring it back himself so he got in beside the young yankee who was driving in the mean time one or two yankees had gone up the road a little way and as they returned prince who was walking up the street overheard them say to the commander that there were some confederates up the road he said they would go down and gather some horses and then go after them prince also overheard one say to the officer why don't you take that ambulance to carry the arms down he replied that that gentleman was using it and he would not trouble him well having taken two horses from citizens who were there they all went down towards monroe and father and prince faced slowly back towards home they had advanced only a few yards when a loud report which they mistook for a gun from the boat arrested their progress they waited for further developments pretty soon the two horses the yankees had taken came running back father thought they had been frightened and thrown their yankee riders pretty soon they heard another report a real gun this time and in a few moments here came one or two of our soldiers saying they had had a skirmish at first father did not believe it but lieut pugh soon overtook him and he found that it was really so it happened thus as the yankees went on down with the buggy in front our men some dozen or so on horseback dashed round the corner and the parties met unexpectedly i reckon to both perhaps our men might have taken the yankees prisoners as the latter were on foot and taken by surprise but the buggy with the citizen in it arrested their fire in the words of mr turner the horse turned right round towards the river the young yankee either jumped or fell out of the buggy young pugh called out charge some of the men discharged their guns the keg of powder exploded between my legs where it was sitting the horse plunged and i jumped out i thought i would light on my feet but came flat down on my face and when i picked myself up and looked round i expected to see at least two or three lying dead on the ground but not one either yankee or confederate was to be seen i don't know where the yankees went to some of them might have jumped over the bluff but i didn't think to look and see and had i thought i wouldn't have looked for fear they would shoot up at me how the powder came to explode no one knows or how the horse got his leg broken it appears that none of the yankees were hurt one of our men was severely wounded he was supported on his horse out to a house about three miles from trenton father laid him on a bed and examined his wound it was just above the hip we heard yesterday evening that dr whyte said it the ball had passed through the liver and that his recovery was doubtful it is sad to think of a life thus lost for worse than nothing the only effect upon the yankees after their fright was over was to exhasperate them they threatened to shell the town but afterwards replied to the entreaties of some of the citizens that on reconsideration they would not do so unless our forces returned that if they saw a rebel soldier there again they would certainly shell the place rebel indeed proud invaders when shall we teach you the bitterness of that word again mrs temple and miss anna moore came over in the afternoon about four o'clock we were surprised by seeing major waddill ride up he had come to monroe on business not expecting to meet the yankees i suppose his business is of a somewhat important and difficult sort i don't know what mother and father invited him to spend the night he went to meet an appointment but returned about dark is a very elegant and agreeable gentleman my short acquaintance with him disposed me to like him very much he is very fond of his family and is a great money maker looks quite jaded probably from fatigue and anxiety combined we are preparing for quite a battle an red river now probably it has taken place before this i scarcely dare to hope much oh if we could but gain it it would so reanimate the sinking spirits and revive the hope that is almost dead i mean always on this side the river from what we hear we have no right to distrust our troops on the other side we hear that forrest and morgan are again doing brilliant things forrest has lately taken and destroyed paducah columbus ken and union city it was nearly dark this evening when lucy seale and mrs norriss rode up on horseback i was alarmed thought they were coming here for refuge from some impending evil lucy looked the picture of troubled alarm wanted to know if father had an ox wagon or any kind of wagon here that he could send for their trunks they were afraid that our men might go back there and that the town would be shelled father had nothing but a cart and promised to send it in tomorrow morning mrs norris had been in to monroe that morning said that the gunboats were not going to stay but a very few days the river is falling so fast as to render a longer delay dangerous capt frank garrett and a lieut hardy were taken prisoners were about town in citizen's dress and someone i suppose informed of them it is a disgraceful thing they ought to be heartily ashamed but mrs norriss says they took it very pleasantly probably they did not reflect that if the yankees chose they might consider them as spies and hang them instead of parolling them an they promised and as they very probably expected when they put themselves in the way father brought me a very cordial sweet note from miss sallie brantley in answer to one i wrote her inviting her to visit us she was on the eve of starting for minden on a visit of three months said she would with pleasure accept the invitation when she returned home in july monday april 11th father went into trenton this morning in company with the cart that went for mrs seale's trunks mrs seale concluded not to send them out today father did not go over to monroe says the yankees appear to be in considerable commotion caused probably from the surprise yesterday father said there were a good many negores on the bank with their bundles who had run to the yankees he says he saw some ladies and children carrying chickens to the boat to barter for coffee sandy who drove the cart was on the bank when the skiff came on shore to get the chickens says the yankees gave one pound of coffee for four chickens sandy asked the negro who was in the skiff if any body could go on board that boat that chose meaning the gunboat the negro said no asked sandy if he wanted to go to stay sandy told him no that he had had no hand in bringing on the war and was not going to have anything to do with it maybe none of our negroes will go but we don't know what might happen it would i feel be far better for them to stay with us but they don't know that and i don't blame them in the least for being dazzled by the false idea of freedom ours go on just exactly as usual as yet one who was hired in monroe is gone to them we hear the same who got drunk and was so impertinent to willie the day we started to georgia and whom we sent back from the la fourche there are six gunboats and no transports we hear now the two that were sent up for the twilight returned today without her and sent up a smaller boat i suppose of course the rest will remain until this one comes down it is such a warm delightful afternoon the view from my open window is beautiful the trees now in their prettiest spring garb the foliage just enough developed to present charming varied tints of delicate green and to let us look through the moving screen to new beauties beyond the dogwoods have not yet faded but the leaves on them are fast mingling green with the hitherto spotless white oh how beautiful the earth is well may we exclaim man alone is vile i do not feel at all well think i must have taken cold my face burns and my throat is quite parched and i have a feeling of nausea and slight lightness of head which is very disagreeable we went into school again this morning after our long recess margaret craig did not come as i expected probably on account of the yankee excitement i do not feel at all afraid am just beginning to realize that they are indeed in monroe we have no fear of their coming out this far tuesday april 12th 1864 i have determined to keep a faithful journal of all i see and hear while the yankees remain at monroe maj waddill left here yesterday morning after breakfast to meet some gentlemen on business he returned with them there were three not long afterwards and after spending an hour in apparently earnest and animated conversation they all left together soon afterwards maj waddill's servant returned with a note from his master stating that they were going on an expedition where they not be likely to meet with much refreshment for the inner man as he expressed it and would be obliged if she would give his servant some bread and meat to cook for them it appears that this note was only a polite subterfuge to avoid asking for a lunch for his hungry companions emmeline told mother afterwards that she had heard one of the gentlemen say he had had nothing to eat for many hours mother was very sorry that she had not known it when they were here she had sent them a bountiful lunch however ready prepared supposing that they were really going on an expedition maj waddill returned at night said that one or two of those gentlemen with him lain in the woods all night with nothing for breakfast but a glass of buttermilk and a crust of biscuit mr ludeling from monroe had come out to see maj waddill in the morning said that he was never placed in such a humiliating position in his life as when in town he was sitting in his office one day since they came when a yankee came up an the pavement before the door and walking up to major bry who was standing there made him an abolition speech said that he was an abolitionist of the deepest dye that there were four classes of men the aristocrats or slave holders the negroes or slaves the free negroes the mules and lastly the poor white men that he wanted to abolish the slaveholders exterminate the slaves so as to give an opportunity for the poor white man to rise this with a good deal more in the same formed his speech i dare say these are the true sentiments of many a one tis not the welfare of the poor negro they seek they are taking all the cotton they can find without pretending to pay for it one or two companies of our men were going about burning all the cotton a week or two ago but the citizens were at that time very much opposed to it and a good deal was hidden away maj waddill is keenly interested about cotton being the owner of a large quantity says the yankees have probably gotten two hundred bales since they came maj waddill says he heard that they forced away one of mr lasar's negroe men though he begged to be allowed to remain with his master this is i suppose an unusual case at this raid i mean i dare say by far the greater proportion have gone willingly poor creatures i pitty them from my heart lieut pugh was here this morning it was after we had gone into school and i did not see him brought a fine turkey which he asked mother to have cooked for them they took it from mr stamper an old countryman back here they met his this morning going in to the river with bale of cotton some eggs and this turkey to trade with the yankees of course took the turkey themselves and i suppose turned him back with the rest this evening a man came over here from the lieut for a pair of scissors to cut hair and soon afterwards another came to know if rather had any hand cuffs that they had two yankee prisoners i am afraid lieut pugh is not very trust worthy i mean for a commander he appears too rash this taking of the prisoners may very likely bring the yankees out here unless they suppose our men in much stronger force than they really are never mind we can be brave i hope in actions as well as words a man from the company of pickets has just come to return the scissors says that the men were not taken from the yankees but are two men whom they took up on the road who say they belong to our artillery and whom they suppose to be deserters lieut pugh's company or rather squadron is camped over here at dr young's house i am so glad they caught those deserters how mean they must be they were probably going to these gunboats they say that several men from our guerilla band over in the swamp have deserted and come in to the yankees i have been playing chess and writing so long this evening that i shall not have much time to finish the cuffs mother left for me to do i have not read any french this week have been sewing and mother has been reading no name to us this is a book miss maggie calderwood sent me the other day when i returned say and seal i had hardly time to read it but could not resist the temptation as it is by wilkie collins i am as much interested in it as i was in the woman in white the weather brilliant and warm the hills around are beautiful i can find no words to express the enchanting picture like loveliness of the fresh and varied tints when i look out i can't take in the scene as i want to do and i sigh to think how short a time it will last friday night april 15th i have allowed two days to pass without writing the news the yankees are gone and i have been so busy that i have not been able before to chronicle this great event we heard the news tuesday evening and on wednesday morning father and mother went to town the yankees had indeed gone taking all the cotton they could get and from five hundred to a thousand negroes almost everyone in monroe lost their house servants and some lost all on their plantations mrs stevens had not one house servant left except her old carriage driver cuffy mrs tucker's little servant girl did not go but every one of mrs stevens did the day that mother was there mrs tucker and mary prepared the dinner their servants did not leave until monday night and left everything prepared for breakfast scott was very honourable she has her misstresses silver in her charge but took none of it away with her i am so sorry for mrs stevens as i said before she has many companions in misfortune mrs garrett is the only lady who lost none five of the railroad negroes left three of whom we thought the most faithful nate little cuffy and ike who all especially nate behaved so well on our way to georgia i believe he was promised a captaincy perhaps that allured him we lost but one negro little emmaline who was hired in monroe with her husband a railroad boy and left with him before leaving town the yankees burned the court house the railroad bridge over the ouachita and one other small public office they did not trouble private property at all except to take all the cotton they could find i was surprised to hear of so many negroes going it is said that one woman killed her little baby who was very sick and she knew would keep her from going many left their little babies on the plantation to go but let us leave this sad and sickening topic for one very dear and happy to me wednesday evening eldridge came back from homer and brought me two letters one from willie and one from mrs morancy willie's letter was very delightful to me is so affectionate he says he arrived in homer about eleven o'clock sunday morning and had gone to church then on the back of the envelope he says that he had been to church that night and that he wishes that i could be there this week they were going to have preaching every night oh my dear brother are my long cherished hopes my daily prayers to be realized shall i see him happy in the way that i have desired for him with a great desire god grant it may be so i wish no better thing for him than that he may feel the love of christ in his heart mrs morancy's letter was affectionate as ever she tells me that willie's staying with them says mrs barr would take no excuse she writes of the happiness of mr bowmar barr and his wife in their baby boy i feel with them in this deepest purest joy it seems strange to think that mr barr is no older than willie mrs mays spent the day with us yesterday came for me to sew her hat i was showing her about how to sew one for her little bay and had so many interruptions that i only finished the crown of her hat have not worked any on it today but shall try and finish it tomorrow it has been disagreeably chilly today fires were comfortable even at noon father and i took a ride this evening saw such a beautiful haw tree in full bloom and gathered a quantity of the fragrant white wreaths some of them are shedding their perfume through my room combined with that of a rose that mary sent me the other day my little geranium is living and growing my valeria it means so much to me as i look on its two delicate little leaves i am scarce refrain from caressing them am only with held by the thought that my caress might hurt it but my writing is becoming almost illegible my eyes are tired and i must prepare for bed wednesday april 20th i did not know so many days had past since i opened my journal book i have been intending to write every day but have not had time monday i received a long letter from willie by maj waddill and sat down to answer it immediately after dinner it gave me great pleasure described his habits of spending his time was going that evening to mrs bennett's to tea and from there to church i was surprised by a letter from miss mattie newcombe it was full of expressions of affection for me of truly kind feeling for willie i have just been answering it shall i say what lies on my mind yes surely here i don't like her extravagant sentimentalities to me when she has once or twice seemed wanting in common attention to my feelings and seems often constrained in my presence i have been disappointed deeply in her and i cannot sincerely respond to extravagant expressions yet i do feel truly grateful for hers and her mother's kindness to my dear brother and i know mrs bennett would not leave anything undone for his comfort if he needed it so how could i write otherwise than affectionately to her and how could i do otherwise than say that i wished very much she would come and see us i do like her very well and i should like to see her and after their warm welcome to willie i should be unkind and ungrateful not to extend the same to her but it troubles me that i have written to her as my dear friend than which i could apply no better save to my dear valeria but let me take up events again margaret craig came to school monday i find her well behaved and intelligent as i expected and better informed than i hoped she is the most deficient in reading writing and arithmetic the reading can soon be improved the fault is chiefly in having been taught to assume a stilted unnatural manner the writing will be improved by practice the arithmetic is the most serious difficulty but she is attentive and desires to learn i have put her with eva who is just commencing both written and mental arithme i had to put her back in the latter and if margaret is any slower to comprehend than eva it will be a wonder mr barr was here yesterday evening brought a little note from his sister asked me to go up with him tomorrow i should like to go but don't feel that i ought finished mrs may's hat saturday after a hard days work have been busy at odds and ends and writing letters every afternoon this week hope to commence reading again tomorrow we have finished no name some parts of it we very fine but as a whole i do not like it as well as the woman in white miss mary lory and i had a delightful walk yesterday evening for flowers we gathered our hands full of haw black haw and honeysuckle and they were so beautiful we have three vases full in the parlour and i have two boquets in my room one of wild flowers and one such a sweet one of roses violets and a lovely cluster of white haw our beautiful and sweet roses are blooming finely now i have gathered six or seven in the last three days must go now to water my geranium i am a little troubled about my dear father he looks badly has a dreadful cold in his head i hope his spirits will rise after this great victory at mansfield it is a second manassas oh how thankful i am it was so unhoped for we did not dare to hope even to check the yankees and now we have triumphed driven them back it is said they have blown up two of their iron clads and it is thought that perhaps the whole fleet will be lost the red river is falling so rapidly and they have obstructed it near the raft by sinking one of their boats which grounded there coming up the traitor governor's wife was on board the transport with a number of officers wives who counted on a pleasant excursion to shreveport what a disappointment to them sunday evening april 24th i am often troubled about the course i ought to pursue towards the children in my daily intercourse with them i have been thinking much about it today and i am afraid i have not been kind enough to them i don't mean that i have ever failed in love to them indeed it is this very love this intense desire that they should grow up virtuous happy and well bred which makes me so eager to help them and i see so many things every day to reprove that i fear i have reproved them too much perhaps i have been too rigid and have not made allowances enough i ought to make them when i am so full of imperfections myself i will try to be more loving in manner as well as in heart i will try not to use authority but persuasion and to pass over slight faults however irritating they may be to me oh i do so want to make them happy and yet i often seem to produce a contrary effect what can i do i can trust in my god i can try always to keep my peace with him if i could do this i should never go wrong monday april 25th this has been a delightful day and how sweet is its close the last rays of the sun are streaming in at my open window and glistening on the foliage which clothes the hillside with almost the luxuriousness of summer verdure for the woods look like it was summer though it has for several days been quite cold we need rain and had great hope of it friday and saturday but it is quite again now saturday father miss mary and i went into monroe we spent a very pleasant day we enjoyed seeing the gardens all flushed with roses which seemed doubly beautiful to us because we had seen so few i went to see miss maggie calderwood when we first went in spent a very pleasant hour or two with her and then drove to mrs delary's for miss mary but found her at mrs jos mcguire's stopped a few minutes there miss mary had determined to spend the day with her while we were looking at the roses in the garden father and mr duvall walked up i had not seen mr duvall before since we left him at millhaven when i drove up to mrs stevens mary met me at the door with her usual sweet smile and kiss the rest of the morning was passed in pleasant conversation and in looking at their garden which was one bed of bright flowers all the morning was not thus passes though i heard some sad news the death of mrs dortche's brother capt martin in the last battle and several others that i knew by name but not personally i had no friend to be killed it is true but my heart bleeds for those who have been so bereaved by the many many killed in that bloody fray which has preserved to us our peaceful homes captain martin died nobly the colour bearer had been three times shot as the third one fell he stood near him and raised the flag in his hand he had not made more than three steps before he fell two balls had penetrated his stomach and one his shoulder he lived for several days said that he had wished if it were necessary to give his life for our cause and that if he saw the way before him again with the end in full view he would not hesitate poor mrs dortch his glorious death cannot now comfort her she must think those sad words he died in his glory but oh he has died we hear many rumours but know nothing certainly about the position of the enemy the time before is anything but a time of rest the war cry resounds on all sides its distant notes come from virginia from kentucky and from the shores of the atlantic while nearer home its thunders appall us what has this year in store for us oh that it may bring peace how calm how soft this evening hours the distant cooing of the dove the chirping of the little chickens under my window the bright rays which shed a soft dying light over all how can believe that this evening so many are losing in mortal strife or groaning and tossing on the wounded soldier's pallet my room is perfumed by a glass full of roses and pinks on my desk our friends in monroe gave us so many roses when we came away they did not know what a precious gift it was i filled a large bowl with them and i never saw a more beautiful boquet or rather pyramid of flowers we hung over them in extasy and came again and again to admire and enjoy our few rose bushes in the garden are blooming beautifully father had a trellis put up before the piazza the other day and we have commenced to train the honeysuckle on it the jessamine is not grown enough for that yet it is putting out finely eldridge returned from homer last night brought a letter from willie and one from miss mat newcombe willie says he hopes to be able to come home the last of this week i hope he will we shall be so glad to see him again it seems like two months since he left instead of two weeks he is in good spirits dear fellow sent home a new mare says he hopes we will have peace in time for him to drive his greys this fall i wish it might be but i can hardly hope it miss mat seemed not to have the slightest idea of any tinge of coldness in my letter to her i am glad she had not hers is as warm as the last says she and her sister hope to come down soon i was very much disappointed by not getting letter or even a message from mrs morancy i expect she is going to write by willie friday april 29th this long day is almost ended i have been so weak and sick all day that i shall welcome the shades of evening it is eva's birthday and in honour of her we have holiday this morning immediately after breakfast we all took a little walk to gather flowers got a quantity of the beautiful graceful blossoms of the old man's beard tree and in coming home stopped at dr young's and gathered our hands full of the honeysuckle that grows over the piazza we have the parlour full of flowers two small boquets and two large ones i did not enjoy the walk much when we reached the old man's beard tree i felt too badly to stand up and the walk home was a painful effort after arranging the flowers i took my seat in a large rocking chair with lamartine but though i was very much interested in the pathetic story of jocelyn i could not read a dreadful weakness overpowered me and i felt exertion impossible while even quiet was pain how glad i was that this was a holiday i lay down on the sofa in the parlour and everything about the room was so quiet the breath of the flowers so sweet as the gentle breeze bore their perfume to my couch that i could not but feel repose and after several hours spent between waking and sleeping i took up my back again a little refreshed but very weary still mr barr came here on business about the iron that he is getting from the burned railroad bridge stayed to dinner is coming back to spend the night with us i was very much indisposed to see anybody but roused myself a little feel better this evening hope this dreadful lassitude will be over tomorrow i have been expecting and hoping for willie all the week i wish so much he would come tonight i expect him very confidently there is no reason to prevent his coming they are doing nothing at homer mother went up to mrs brinton's wednesday for her spinning wheels did not return until yesterday to dinner we missed her very much indeed she took loring with her they brought me a beautiful white texas pink wild pholx the first i over saw brought two roots of the traveller's delight i set them out but scarce dare to hope they will live after having lost so many vines it has been very warm for several days past summer is here in earnest now we need rain very much indeed if it would only rain everything would grow beautifully i water my little garden every evening my delicate little geranium has begun to grow quite fast has lost all it's old leaves and has three green healthy looking new ones the two heliotropes are also doing very well our few rose bushes are blooming abundantly i gather a large bunch of roses every morning the good news from the army still comes in we heard of a gallant exploit of price's today the taking killing or dispersing of three thousand yankees have no particulars yet forrest is still doing good service in tennessee and kentucky our prospects are good at richmond all sides look bright after the great darkness which has so long hung over our beloved south i have just come from witnessing the children's little party they had a table set under the trees down at the foot of the gently sloping grove and there the four sat eva loring george and john all as happy and contented as possible miss mary and i sat and looked on eva is fourteen today i often look at her and think how different she is from me at that age she is a perfect child with all the naieveté of ten years old she has no idea of self control lately in my moments of bodily weakness the sad thought comes over me that i am losing my youth it is more a hypochondriacal fancy than anything else i expect i have never had any beauty i have always known and sadly known that i was ugly but i have lost my color my eyes are often surrounded by a purple band of coloring my hair used to be the only beautiful thing about me and now it has fallen out till it is not more than half as thick as formerly i can't walk fast or walk at all without being exhausted by it and these frequent seasons of unconquerable lassitude incline me to fretfulness i fancy that my voice is getting shrill it is not so strong as it used to me i know oh what a terrible picture it is only to relieve myself that i draw it it may provoke a smile in some better day to read over these querolous complainings no one would recognize these changes but myself and therefore they must be in a great degree imaginary i can't bear to think on the want of energy i perceive in myself i find it an effort to keep myself properly dressed it in true i have not much to dress in but i might look better than i do must go and change my red calico for a thinner dress saturday night april 30th the rain the longed for rain has come at last and how softly it falls upon the thirsty earth how i wish it were day that i could watch it it is delightful thus though and i will not be so ungrateful as to wish for anything more the smell of the rain comes up from the earth speaking its gratitude all the evening the clouds have been gathering and since supper the rain has commenced gentle at first but growing faster and faster it sounds like one of these delightful slow and general rains i hope it will last all night i have such a beautiful bowl of flowers again father went to monroe this morning and mary sent me a boquet and a note saying that her aunt was sick in bed and that she was quite uneasy about her and this evening miss maggie calderwood and miss laura barnes brought me a large and beautiful boquet i did not see them miss mary and i had walked over to mrs lidwell's to see miss anna moore and they met mother as it was very late and they had come principally to see mother on business they did not come on they brought a note from mrs dortch requesting mother to take her to board this summer mother refused of course it would be too great a care entirely for mother in these times and in her health i have felt miserably again today but hope i shall be better tomorrow this rain is so delightful there was a young lady here this evening who is on her way to missouri their ambulance wheel broke and they stopped to have it mended she was in new orleans when it fell has not seen her mother for four years her father has come for her and she is going home with him had been staying in shreveport had met mrs mcclay and mrs walker there said she thought that none of gen walker's staff were killed in this last battle willie has not come yet i have been hoping and looking for him all day
sunday night april 16th it has been a lovely easter sunday and i have spent it happily but am almost too weary now to write as i have felt today the sun has shone brightly on the fresh green of the spring foliage it was like a summer day and is now but little cooler than a summer evening i was so rejoiced last week so overjoyed at receiving two letters from my darling valeria i am rewarded after my weary waiting i had almost grown tired of hoping for them how often it is that we receive blessings when expectation has almost failed these letters are so like my friend her beautiful spirit breathes through them it is somewhat like seeing her only far less happy how just a foundation has that friendship which time absence even silence can but strengthen and how worthy is its object she speaks of trials of troubles but with no shadow of discontent to dim her serene cheerfullness her letters tell me of her unvarying affection how invaluable it is to me oh i can never be grateful enough that our correspondence has been renewed i hope i am not presumptuous in saying providentially renewed i know i thank god for this blessing most gratefully in the same mail with valeria's i received a letter from lois we have wished so much to hear from georgia this letter is the first we have received and it is too short to satisfy us hungry as we are for news grandma and lois are still safe the yankees acted as we had imagined they would the country is desolated in their track what hurts me greatly is that uncle dole and aunt latire with their families have gone north i understand from lois letter went with the yankees a great shame but not unexpected uncle dole's wife was just from there and aunt latire also the ties of relationship are not strong enough to bear such a shock henceforth we shall be as strangers uncle david suffered from the yankees his mill was burned and mules taken his negroes i suppose as a matter of course he was himself taken prisoner but escaped he had sent aunt may and the children about six weeks previous himself accompanying them as far as memphis lois wrote no further particulars i wish more than ever to hear directly from them i cannot help feeling sorry that aunt mary has gone though it may be for the best and i know she and uncle david are true to us lois says the yankees behaved very badly in our old neighbourhood our old friend gen robison suffered much from them but more from himself he returned from sandersville one evening in february quite intoxicated and according to accounts from his negroes fell off the piazza and broke his thigh lois said he suffered greatly and she feared he would not recover we are all very sorry to hear this bad news lois writes of the sudden death of another of our old neighbours honest mr mcafee i had hoped to see him once more i am too tired to write any more have been too busy for the last month to indulge in journalizing it has been as much as i could do to write my letters of which i have written a good number and quite lengthy ones thursday april 20th i am depressed almost to despair life seems to have lost its interest earth it's beauty of what use is courage under difficulties hope in misfortune when courage can no longer avail hope no longer cheer day before yesterday father returned from monroe with a countenance expressing the news before he spoke richmond is evacuated and it is reported and universally believed that lee and johnston have surrendered and also forrest if this is true all is lost lost my god what a word our country gone i feel as if all were gone i had never felt the possibility of this blow all that makes life glorious what virtue can be left to one that has no country even resignation seem like treason to our principles it is like darkness it is so terrible have our brave soldiers fought for nothing died for this no not for nothing if it be indeed so if this dreadful calamity fell upon us yet have they not died for nothing i cannot regret our course better die protesting for our liberty than tamely submit the bitterness is that we might have won it was never before known that such a people perished and shall we perish shall we indeed perish i received a letter from willie poor boy he writes so gayly his letter expresses such bouyancy such confidence in and devotion to our glorious confederacy i fear its glory has fallen i think i ought to try to feel less bitterly may god help me this is a sore trial my country has been my great love my pride my life yet even this is little to him what are nations in his sight is not it impious in me to rebel against his power worse than foolish to set my opinions my wishes against his will am i indeed now regarding my wish to devote my life my most cherished feelings to him to have no other gods to bow down to no other idols and these dear ones i have a duty to them i ought not selfishly to forget this i must not dishonour my holy religion by failing here especially now ought i to excel in faith to be joyful in hope instead of this terrible despairing grief next sunday mr lawson is to be at monroe again and i am to be baptized if no preventing occasion occurs mrs dortch is to be my godmother thursday night i am more composed now than when i wrote the above was called away about some household affair as mother was absent the night finds me more able to say thy will be done it seems that nothing more is left for us now i am afraid to hope yet it is impossible to banish hope entirely and even if it were i am utterly unable to realize a calamity so great and to me so unlooked for however this may be i feel that i must not now give myself up to these thoughts in a few days i shall stand at god's altar it befits me to think of this to prepare myself as much as possible for this wednesday april 26th monday evening father and i rode to trenton and were met by capt reynolds who told us the astounding news lincoln and seward are killed the first in the theatre the other in his bedchamber it is an event so little like modern times that it could not be believed but on the most satisfactory evidence it electrified us it must electrify the world it is the first note of new drama what will follow heaven only knows it is utterly impossible for me to imagine it must have a powerful effect i hope that the words of the actor booth may find an echo in every southron's hearts while he clasps afresh his weapon let him cry sic semper tyrannis virginia's glorious motto let it be our watchword oh that it might be this news awaked us from the stupor following on that of lee's surrender jimmy stone came very unexpectedly and spent saturday night with us he brought a full confirmation of the dreadful news he had just returned from a trip to the river and while there he had received yankee papers containing the entire correspondence between lee and grant terms of surrender and everything he had heard the salute at vicksburg two hundred guns it seems that no evidence could be stronger than this yet mr brinton was here this morning and says he does not believe it for he saw a soldier an extremely well informed one from the other side of the river who says it was fitzhugh lee not the general in chief i hope it may be so yet i can hardly hope it seems that even yankee mendacity could not extend so far father has gone to millhaven will be back this evening and may bring some more news father like a steadfast man as he is is not bowed down though deeply grieved by the news mr gordon was out saturday spent the night with us very much depressed the water floating his cotton away he came up to get lumber for boats the waters are very high there is not often such an overflow mr gordon brought me several letters one from willie two long and deeply interesting ones from valeria i have commenced answering them but it takes a long time to answer such letters one of them was three months on the way where can it have been the weather has been cool enough for fire night and morning fortunately no frost i received a note from miss eliza baker saturday evening saying that mr lawson would not be down until next sunday so we did not go in jimmy stone left sunday morning for camp again says his regiment will fight to the last he looks very well indeed willie was well wrote in good spirits poor fellow his letters make me feel pitiful coming as the last two have after this sad news oh that it might be false
friday may 10th it is quite a long time since i have written here not because i have been very busy not because i have been sick as my last entry makes it appear probable only i have not felt like it and then i might as well not write anything as such entries as my last few thoughts and reflections indeed they seem very sensible when i am writing them but when i look over them afterwards i do not know whether to laugh or blush but i must be careful not to go on with a page full of them now for uncle jim is going up to the place and i told him to call me when he was ready i have spent the last weeks rather taking long walks in the woods painting a little sewing a little and talking a good deal well i have been to the place and returned miss mary and i just in time to escape the dark and after resting and brushing my hair for supper i sit down to write a little on our way up to the place i saw mrs reynolds out before the door milking and stopped to speak to her she told me some news carrie young the doctor's eldest daughter came home with him night before last she is six months older than i am and was to have graduated at nashville tenn next month her mother spent the day here wednesday and said she did not expect her until the last of june her coming was therefore very unexpected father went to vicksburg tuesday we expect him back tonight uncle moses was there yesterday he says that they are afraid that the levees are broken up above the river is rising more slowly and they do not apprehend an overflow our house is begun or at least the carpenter is engaged the spot cleared and staked and a shelter erected to work under we are only to have three rooms this summer one a future school room which is to be larger and more finished than the other two which are to be moved if father decides to remain and erect a house upon the place we have to move from here by the first of next month father tried to get our time extended but could not and a few days since a lady told mother that mrs bry sent her word she should be out here the first of june and wanted her house uncle moses and willie's mill has commenced sawing aunt jane has been sick for the last ten days she suffers much but is not dangerous mr elbridge pierce came out to the mill wednesday he is to help willie he is not very well now having been sick with chills for some time tuesday may 14th father has staid at home three whole days that is he has not been anywhere except to the mill and up to the place oh it will be so hard to have him go away again he says he must go to new orleans either this evening or tomorrow i will begin and give the record of the days since friday saturday afternoon i went up to mrs young's to see her daughter carrie whom i found very pleasant although i had a slight feeling that my manners might seem a little brusque by the side of the tall sedate boarding school young lady who being just from school has not had time to settle into our country ways she is quite tall and slender with a small face and features dark eyes and hair and a very good complexion with no freckles what a contrast to me short thick square faced and large featured grey eyes reddish yellow hair and a complexion once fair but now between tan and freckles almost brown i do not mind all the rest but as i looked at carrie i said to myself as i have often said before if i was only tall father came up to dr young's and walked home with me dr and mrs young and their daughter came as far as our place where we stopped to see how the builders were getting on they have erected the frame of an out house which we are to occupy at first but which is afterwards to serve as kitchens and servant's rooms while we live at the school house sunday we were as usual all together with the addition of some visitors mr pierce came up with wilhe in the morning and stayed some time though he could not remain to dinner on account of an engagement in monroe he had just gone and father and i had come in here he to look over some papers and i to read the morning service when some one came to the door and said mr john green has come how provoking was the first exclamation which sprang to my lips but i checked it and after i had finished my reading followed father out on the piazza mr green has joined a company in madison county of this state he is a private the company is called the madison infantry his conversation was upon the subject of soldiers and soldiering generally and was on that account interesting to me he left some time after dinner late in the afternoon miss bry with a young friend called to see us they had been spending the day with mrs adams their call was short and on both sides a very little constrained yesterday morning father took us all down to the mill in the carriage one of the springs of which was broken and which father spent several hours in mending his trade is that of a blacksmith and though he has had no practice for many years he has not forgotten how to shoe a horse or weld a piece of iron i spent the day in watching father looking after the children and sitting in the mill observing their motions before we left they commenced to saw and miss mary and i amused ourselves very much watching their operations uncle moses was the only one who really understood what was to be done and it was really laughable to see him run from the boiler to the engine then to the saw then to the end of the log where an inexperienced negro was turning the wrong way then up stairs to look at the cistern every little while vociferating orders in no very mild tone of voice mr pierce stood attending to the engine willie working alternately at the saw and the log the sawyer a deliberate ignorant man looking on as if he was astonished out of his knowledge by uncle moses rapid movements and last of all the negroes looking very curious and trying to do their best though they were constantly grinning at the novelty of a steam saw mill a few days will get them in better discipline and then we may find something to admire as well as to amuse we came home in time to go up to the place and see what was doing father has a carpenter two white men and a negroe up there at work on our shanty aunt jane has very sick today i was quite alarmed this evening for mother went up to see mrs axley our carpenter's wife whose sister's child is dead and i did not know what i should do if she were to be siezed with one of those hysteric or fainting fits which she has had since her illness i have interrupted my writing often to go to her and have just come away she is in bed with a high fever probably from her exertions in vomiting father has been at the mill all day it is time he was returning now we had a heavy rain last night and it has been quite cool all day we had a little fire this morning tuesday may 21st aunt jane has gone to monroe she left saturday in the carriage and bore the journey very well eva met uncle moses yesterday and he said that aunt jane was just as sick as she was here father returned from new orleans sunday night and remained at home yesterday he expects to leave for vicksburg today but john was quite sick last night and he may not go we were afraid last night that john had the cholera infantum but he is a little better this morning mother father and i went up to the place yesterday evening and from thence to dr young's we rode home in the big waggon the place is getting to look more cultivated the shed for us is not half done yet and those for the negroes not commenced and we have only ten days more in this house i received a letter from miss lou garrett last night she invited me to come down to handsboro and see her quite an impossibility it is quite cool this morning but was oppressively warm yesterday and the day before friday may 31st 61 the last day of the month a month passed with but little improvement to me i have idled away too much time which might have been improved mr and mrs horne leila and howell came to see us monday night and after a very pleasant visit as far as we were concerned left yesterday afternoon father has gone to chatanooga to attend a railroad convention he will probably go to savannah and will be gone two weeks a long time and which it saddens me to think must be passed without him he left yesterday afternoon with the horne's mother accompanied them to monroe and visited aunt jane who mother thinks is looking very well indeed mr axley father's carpenter has been sick for a week father has engaged another carpenter who will begin work
sunday may 4th 62 father has been away ever since last sunday he stayed at de soto nearly all the week and then went down the country in search of some government officers with he has business the river has risen so high as to cover nearly half the railroad with its waters the last we heard from new orleans was that the yankees had demanded its surrender and that all the confederate flags should be hauled down and the stars and stripes run up instead mayor monroe said in reply that in compliance with his request gen lovell had withdrawn his forces from the city as they could not successfully resist the enemy that he the mayor was no military man that if he had an army at his command it would be presumptuous in him to lead it to the field and that he knew still less how to surrender a city filled with women and children and unarmed citizens the city was at their mercy but that as to hauling dawn the flag of their adoption and substituting the hated one of their invaders there was not a man in his constituency so dastardly that his hand and heart would not be palsied at the thought of such a thing and in conclusion he said that he wished them to understand that the people in new orleans while unable at this moment to prevent you from occuppying their city do not transfer their allegiance from the government of their choice to one which they have deliberately repudiated and that they yeild simply in obedience to that which the conqueror is able to extort from the conquered the yankees had not entered the city the forts below still held out commodore duncan says that he will not surrender so long as there is a shot in the locker i hope he will keep his word none of the enemy's transports had passed up and no more gunboats we heard yesterday of a battle at yorktown it was a dreadful battle the dispatch said that we were in full pursuit of the yankees and that their escape had been cut off by the virginia but sad to tell gens lee and joe johnston were both killed general and president davis was in command a battle is daily expected at corinth both armies are concentrating their forces and will move as soon as the weather allows roads to dry a little we have had a very wet spring since may came in it has been very bright warm weather however sunday may 18th 1862 oakland our first sabbath in our new house how still every thing is the sawing and hammering is hushed and from the grove we hear the twitter of birds mingled with the noise of chickens and occassionally the lowing of stock how blessed is the sabbath in it we leave the busy walks of life in it there sometimes seems to shine a light like that which shone around saul and which makes our secret sins appear before us at the same time that it reveals the saviour in all his beauty i feel a calm today which is refreshing to me for awhile the great sorrow of our times is partially lifted from my heart i am afraid i have sinned in being too anxious about our future i know i am not willing enough to submit to the will of god whatever it should be i am too impatient and cannot wait for the bitter bud to unfold into the flower redolent with sweetness but i will try and be more trustful we moved here thursday and ever since then i have been arranging my things and getting ready to settle into our casual quiet study life which we commence again tomorrow our home is so pleasant and it is so delightful to be at home that i tremble sometimes lest it should be taken from us i hope i shall in any case not love it so much as to forget that it is a home which is only to serve us for the brief period of our earthly life we are very comfortable here and we find it quite pleasant to live upstairs as we do now we have four large rooms besides two large dressing rooms and a wide long hall which is our sitting room it has eight windows four in each end in one end we have a flower shelf in each window on which we have placed our small collection of flowers i transplanted my heliotrope friday it was growing beautifully and had a bud on it but transplanting it caused it to wither and i had to cut off many of the leaves it has livened up a great deal today miss newcomb and miss bennet have been spending the last week with carrie young i have seen three times i was over there yesterday evening the family were very much delighted by the arrival of their uncle col young from the war we have reason now to keep constantly in mind the transitory state of human affairs and the need of a more stable hope for every day deepens the gloom hanging over our country the victory which was reported to have taken place at yorktown was only a false report it is now said that norfolk has allen and that we have burnt the virginia in order to keep her from falling into the hands of the yankees new orleans is in their possession and their gunboats are coming up the river it is reported that there has been a little battle in virginia in which we were victorious it now seem as if it would be a long time before we can have peace i can bear it so long as it bring us peace and liberty at last father has been at home all this week he is obliged to leave tomorrow i dread to see him go even for a day how much more for such an indefinite period willie has the chills again he had one day before yesterday it seems impossible for him to go to the war mother received a letter from grandma holton yesterday it is very sad horace came out of the skirmish safe but was killed by a sentinel whom he himself had put upon guard and told to shoot any one who came near horace passed by and by some sad mistake the sentinel fired and killed him immediately grandma writes that before his death he was much changed and seemed very penitent for the errors of his youth bernard is worse
oakland may 16th 1863 just a month since my last entry in my old book what a busy month it has been i cannot record all that has happened but will give a few items about the 20th of last month mrs stone a lady from the swamp came to mother to get board for herself and family for a week they had escaped from the swamp in haste and at night lost all their clothing except what was contained in one small trunk and abandoned their house and furniture entirely to the yankees and negroes mother was very reluctant to take them but they urged it and she could not refuse persons in their situation so they came mrs stone miss kate rebecca and jimmy and johnny they are a very pleasant family have no small children rebecca is eleven years old and a very nice good little girl mrs stone has been here very little of the time and johnny and jimmy have been away a great deal miss kate is a very sweet young lady so unaffected and agreeable mary stevens came out and spent a week with me last month as she promised it was a delightful week to me that is as pleasant as anything of that kind is now when there is a continual trouble upon us all monday evening we were all looking at gen'l walker's division which was passing and had just returned from the grove when a gentleman rode up and inquired if we could accommodate mrs maclay wife of the adjutant inspector general he said the gen was at dr young's but they could not take mrs maclay mother said yes and they soon drove up mrs maclay and his little girl nannie she travels all around with her husband has an ambulance nicely fitted up and is quite as comfortable as possible under the circumstances she remained here until this morning her husband major maclay was in the old army all gen walker's staff were camped over on dr young's hill they were young men and were quite agreeable we saw a great deal of them several came over every day tuesday evening we had a little soiree invited the misses dawson carrie young and julia compton besides the gentlemen of the staff mr axley fiddled for us and we danced and spent a very pleasant evening the company did not leave until past two o'clock thursday we dined at mrs compton's with the same party went to dress parade in the evening but were too late went again yesterday evening and saw col flournoy's regiment parade i had never seen it before and was perfectly delighted i went in the ambulance with mrs maclay and took all the children miss mary went with maggie compton major maclay was very kind to get us a good position and then to stand by and tell us about all the evolutions he is such a very pleasant man i like him very much and his wife is also very plain and agreeable last night we were at mrs dawson's until twelve the evening was quite pleasant the starlight was beautiful major french drove me down in our buggy he is a very pleasant man so kind and yet gay enough and intelligent besides him there were major mason major stone captain galt and captain smith all virginians except major stone from arkansas we had some quite pleasant incidents happen in connection with these soldiers saturday one came here for his dinner and after dinner asked for some music miss mary sang for him and he seemed very much pleased the soldiers were then on they way to alexandria but after the news of the fall of that place reached us they were ordered back and this soldier in company with another stopped here on sunday for some water they had some water and milk and rested awhile and then went on after saying that they wished it were not sunday so they could hear some music we also regretted it on monday haw's brigade passed and we went down in the grove to see them eva and rebecca stone were at the fence giving water to the soldiers poor fellows tramping along the dusty road they looked so warm that mother had buckets of water carried down to the fence for them they crowded around the buckets like bees and seemed so grateful among these was the second soldier who came on sunday he said he would like to hear some singing and eva told him to come up to the house and her sister would sing for him we laughed and thought no more of it but looking in a few minutes we saw three men riding up to the door sure enough they had come for the music so we came in and gave them some they stayed about an hour and we found that the prominent one of the party was of the georgia family of tuckers all of whom we had heard off and had met some mother gave them some milk before they left and miss mary and miss kate put some flowers in their hats when mr tucker went to tell us goodbye the tears came in his eyes as he asked to know the name of those to whom he was so much indebted the division is composed of strong fine looking men well clothed and apparently well drilled the camp looked so nice yesterday evening when we went there it was all swept so nicely and the men looked cheerful and busy some were shaking out their blankets some cooking some playing marbles some watering horses and engaged in all manner of diverse occupations but though the sight was cheerful yet it made me feel sad i think in these scenes of those that are gone forever major french and major mason came over this morning to bid us goodbye we feel very quiet today after having so much excitement as we have had for the past week mrs stone and jimmy are in delhi getting some negroes from their plantation willie has been as busy as possible for the past week arranging to have the railroad negroes brought over this side of the river they are here now about seventy poor willie is getting quite pale and thin again i hope all this fatigue will not make him sick again the weather is quite cool for this season of the year it is warm at mid day but the mornings and evenings are almost cold tuesday may 26th 63 we have three more lodgers now really our house seems quite elastic we thought it full to overflowing when mrs stone came but now we accommodate these ladies very well willie gave up his room and took an unfinished one on the north side of the house mother would not have taken these ladles but the circumstances of their case were so sad she could not refuse mrs barr and her daughter mrs morancy are both widows mrs morancy was only a wife eighteen months and her husband died recently she has a little baby eight or nine months old mrs barr has lost two grown sons within the last two years was obliged to leave her plantation and lost a great deal her house with all her furniture was burnt by her negroes a few days after she left it her family now consists of her widowed daughter a young lady daughter miss julia and mr bowmar barr and wife they are all scattered about the two first here miss julia at mrs dortch's and the young couple they have only been married three or four months are keeping house at a cabin on dr temple's land i an so sorry for them the cabin is built of logs without any ceiling or a single window how hard it is for families to be separated in this way we are really fortunate in our lodgers they are all such pleasant people mrs barr seems to be a very sweet lady her troubles though many have not soured her disposition at all
tuesday may 3rd 1864 i have just finished my late dinner after having been asleep all the morning sunday evening mother miss mary and i went to see mrs hawkins a poor woman whose only child is very ill we found the poor little girl at the point of death as we thought yesterday evening mother and i went down again the child was no better and the poor mother was quite worn out with watching and care she had no one to sit up that night and i resolved to stay mrs lidwell afterwards came over and we persuaded mother to go to bed exhaustion conquered her and she slept soundly all night while mrs lidwell and i kept watch the poor little girl has been sick in bed four weeks and for a week past has taken scarcely any nourishment she lay quietly almost all night i felt so sorry for her she must be a beautiful child in health her eyes are large and black and she has silky golden hair even attenuated as they are her features are beautiful she is only six years old has been afflicted since her infancy with a partial deafness and dumbness caused from scarlet fever her head is now drawn back and paralized so that she keeps it constantly in a painful position it seems like it would be a mercy for god to take her to heaven but our poor earthly eyes cannot see this just before day mrs lidwell thought she was dying and woke up her mother the poor woman wept and sobbed in an agony of grief we stood by powerless to comfort or help while it seemed to me that my breast heaved in unison with every sobbing laboured breath that little sallie drew in about a half hour she rallied a little and we left mrs hawkins with a promise to return this evening the morning was fresh and beautiful the sun was just rising and his earliest rays fell on a scene of exquisite freshness and beauty gilding the shining green leaves of the oaks and the dusky tops of the pines above while the wheat field and the road lay in dewy shadow as i walked slowly homeward i thought of how many such mornings i have risen and looked out on all this beauty many a time with a glad worshipping heart but ah too many times with a dimming care and a heart full of my own little daily troubles not thinking of how many wake every morning to bitter or despairing sorrow i am afraid i have been too selfish and have confined my cares my hopes too much to the circle of home i might have done much more at least i might have thought much more and might have prayed and trusted more than i have done father went to millhaven yesterday morning we do not expect him back until tonight perhaps he may not come then willie has not come yet mr barr is going to send a servant to homer thursday and i shall write to willie by him mr barr spent last night here and breakfasted with us this morning loring and eve were a little unwell yesterday and the night before have recovered now the weather has been quite cool since the shower we had saturday night last night we were afraid there would be frost but there was none night i returned from mrs hawkins late this evening her little girl was still breathing oh how sorrowful to see her lie thus her breath coming gaspingly and her poor weary eyes seeming dimmed by the shadow of death i did not think she would have stayed so long soon she will be one of heaven's angels our father knows when to call his children home when i look at this dying little child how all my cares my sorrows and my restless yearning fall away from me what matter is it what troubles we pass through if we only bear them so that we shall be taken to god at last wednesday may 11th i have not had time to write any for the last week and am now filching a few minutes from my sleeping time last thursday evening we were delighted by the arrival of willie and miss mat newcombe and her sister i was so glad to see willie he looks perfectly well and his visit has given me great pleasure the young ladies too i like them so much better than when they came down they are both very pleasant and amiable girls i think mattie has a very sweet disposition thus do my feelings change with acquaintance i ought never to form a hasty judgement we have been to ride every evening since they came sunday we went to town to church miss mary shep willie went to the catholic and mattie and i to the protestant church we heard a very feeling sermon from mr mcguire and one which affected me deeply it was decided saturday that i am to go to homer with the young ladies we leave tomorrow mattie and shep spent monday and tuesday in town we have all been working hard today getting me ready for my visit i had two dresses to make they are beautiful patterns but are from yankee land and i shall not on that account take pleasure in wearing them should not have taken them but that father had bought them and wished me to wear them and i thought i could not disregard a positive duty for one which is perhaps doubtful mr gordon brought the things from vicksburg some coffee tea cloth and actually some fruit i am ashamed to write it i could not bear to eat those things the night after they came i went to sit up at mrs hawkins and at father's urgent request took an orange with me which i shared at midnight with the other woman who was watching with me then at supper the next night i was afraid to wound father's feelings by refusing the piece of pineapple he offered me but it did me no good mrs hawkins little child died sunday i have not been able to go to see her since have not had a moment to spare we had a little rain monday i can't sit up any longer it is already late my next date will be in homer i feel like i was going far off can't bear to think of taking leave of them all for two whole weeks tonight when i was thinking about it the thought came over me suppose i was called to the last bitter parting suppose god should call me to him oh the bitterness of that hour but thanks be to god who giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ
tuesday june 4th willie is not well he was taken with a very sore tongue saturday afternoon went to dr white who gave him a wash and some pills his a little tongue is a little better but is still very painful indeed the new carpenter has gone to work and our shanty seems in a fair way of building after all mother has undertaken to board the carpenter he is a yankee but has been south five years and now classes himself with the southerners we had a delightful rain yesterday it came just in time for the gardens were quite dry and the roads very dusty i am writing before breakfast having risen at half past five to be ready for the early breakfast which mother has on the carpenter's account the morning is delightful everything looks so cheerful gilded by the morning sunlight the birds too are singing very sweetly afternoon mr john green has just left he came to bid us goodbye his company leaves saturday or monday captain george wardell father sent mother a letter by mr green saying that there is a rumour that invasion is threatened on the north of arkansas and that if this rumour is true willie must mount his horse throw business to the winds and fly to defend our homes and yet willie is sick my heart turns faint as i write it his tongue is worse and he thinks ulcers are forming in his throat oh if it should be the dreaded canker mother will take him to monroe this evening to consult a doctor there may god in his mercy avert this trial saturday june 1st willie's tongue is much better the improvement became perceptible yesterday last night we had a joyful surprise miss mary and i were in our night dresses when rose came into the room exclaiming miss sarah and miss mary come and see your pa i ain't fooling you he is come hardly believing her we went into the room and there sure enough was father i have not seen him yet this morning and do not know what news he brings mother's drygoods from new orleans came up the other day and we are all quite busy sewing miss mary and i went to mrs axley's yesterday to have some things fitted mr axley is still sick the weather as may be expected in june is warm thursday was a very oppressive day home june 19th 61 once more i feel that i am justified in using the word home and though our home is very rude and very much crowded still a feeling of satisfaction comes over me when i think that for the first time in more than three years our house and land little as it is is yet ours but it has been a long time since i have written any and i must briefly note the events which have occurred since june the 8th in the first place willie has gone back to the mill his tongue is apparrently well but his voice is still very thick and the shape of his mouth is a little impaired father went to vicksburg sunday afternoon but returned thursday morning and then we commenced moving father slept up here thursday and friday nights friday after dinner i came up and spent the evening in arranging furniture and clothing and saturday night miss mary eva lory and i slept here father of course remaining with us and willie sleeping at mr bry's as a protection for mother we walked down to breakfast sunday morning and spent the day at mr bry's truly we were all glad of the rest which the sabbath afforded father laid down the greater part of the day and i was very tired sunday night we came up here to sleep leaving mother as before monday morning walked down to breakfast again and rode back on the wagon in the afternoon mother came up and monday night for the first time we all slept to together under the roof of our new home it really would be amusing to a person not initiated into the customs of southern country people to have seen how we lived our house is a long low building divided at one end by a partition into two rooms the end room which is occupied by mother father george and the baby is about 17 feet square and has two windown and two doors the room in which i am now writing is appropriated to miss mary eva lory and i besides rose who sleeps on the floor and george's puppy who cannot bear the cold night air and is therefore obliged to be taken into our room these are it's occupants during the night it is our sitting room in the day this room is about 32 feet long and has four windows and three doors it has no ceiling but some planks are laid at irregular distances on the rafters in order that all unnecessary trunks and boxes my be piled upon them for the sake of my amusement in some subsequent hour when we shall have exchanged our present residence for a more roomy one and when i may have become partially oblivious to our present state i subjoin an inventory of the furniture contained in this last mentioned room there are two bedsteads two wardrobes three bureaus one large chest one grand piano with stool one couch two washstands with towel horses three large trunks and one small one two kegs of nails one rocking horse one box of tools one side saddle and a great many chairs besides this there are numberless bandboxes baskets and toys lodged on the tops of the two wardrobes and on the boards overhead before spoken of i count four trunks three valises a box of sash five pillows and one bolster a broken table and a frame for a couch musquetoe net eleven book boxes and one chair these pretty well fill up our room not to mention a row of nails for dresses which are kindly overshadowed by a chintz curtain another row for hats caps coats and bonnets and still another for sundries to fill up the picture it must be reccollected that the walls of our home are of rough undressed weatherboarding without a ceiling that the rafters and the posts of the house are of pine stripped of its bark but otherwise undressed and that neither windows nor doors have aught to close them but are merely openings in the wall we have now curtains but until monday we had not even these besides the house i have described we have a kitchen which is set upon blocks and the boards nailed on about two inches apart which gives it the appearance of a large birdcage between the house and the kitchen connecting with both and walled like the latter there is a room which we use as a dining room and in which we keep the safes we have as yet no storeroom nor stable the mules and horses are kept at mr bry's still but will be removed with uncle jim to willie's old camps tomorrow we have not any well yet but get our water from dr young's sallie is still at mr bry's and will not come up here until she finishes the weeks washing father a negroe man and a boy raking up the leaves grubbing up the roots and cutting down the bushes in our yard this is a very pretty place though not as beautiful or as susceptible of improvement as the other hill upon which i hope father will build a permanent residence i rode down to mr axley's with father yesterday i rode railroad at first i was rather afraid as it has been nearly two years since i was on horseback before and railroad is very tall but i soon became quite easy and enjoyed the ride very much father went to vicksburg yesterday afternoon we expect him back tonight mr axley did not come to his work this morning he must be sick again i hope he will soon for we need his services very much ah i am nearly on the last leaf of this old book this book which has been my companion for almost two years which has been with me from louisiana to canada and which has been the repository of many feelings both of joy and sorrow i cannot close it without one brief sentence concerning my country on sunday we received the latest news affairs in virginia remain the same both parties are concentrating their forces but there has been no fight beyond a few slight skirmishes but developments are being made in another direction missourri at last has spurned the yoke of the cowardly tyrant of the united states her governor has issued a proclamation for state troops to repel the lincolnites if kentucky would but follow this noble example what might not the result be but mother calls me to walk with her goodbye dear journal this is my last entry in this book and for the first time i feel how dear it has become to me home sunday june 23rd 1861 this is my first entry in my new journal book the leaves are all fresh and fair let me try to keep them unsullied by evil thoughts and the record of evil actions yet to do this and still keep a faithful record my life must be pure i would that one mighty effort might achieve this then should i achieve it but as this may not be i must watch against the little trials which tempt me to daily sins our first sunday at our new home has been past as usual alltogether willie stays here now he has sold his interest in the mill to mr pierce and will stay there no more this morning after breakfast rose went over to mrs young's to enquire if the doctor had come she brought word that he had not and that carrie was sick in bed mother thought i had better go and see carrie so miss mary and i went over we found that it was only one of rose's exaggerated messages and that carrie was no worse than usual only she had taken some medicine which weakened her and consequently she had not yet risen we stayed nearly an hour but she did not come out she has not been well since she returned home i have been spending today very quietly trying to strengthen myself against the incursions of fretfulness and illtemper which so often cloud my horizon i am often tried since we removed here i can have no privacy or quiet and i have been so much indulged in both since my earliest years that they are almost necessary for my happiness but i can only conquer myself this trial will be useful to me it is very warm the thermometer at 95 every one of the family except me are lying on beds and couches or leaning back in rocking chairs with palm leave fans trying to keep cool the rays of the sun beam down with intense heat and when we go to the south door the air is like a blast from a furnace to me there is something exciting in this intense heat vicksburg tuesday june 25th 61 we father and i left home yesterday afternoon for this place i have been dreading for a long time to have my teeth examined by a dentist lately one of them commenced to ache i could no longer put off the evil day and so i came to vicksburg with father we arrived here safely this morning i have just come from dr miles have had four teeth filled and some tartar removed it was not half as bad as i expected being more tiresome than painful dr miles was so gentle and kind that i suffered nothing from fear the corners of my mouth are the greatest sufferers they feel as if stretched out of all shape i have been lying down to refresh me a little before the evening we rose so early this morning that i felt a little dull but am quite bright now mr green came in to see me after dinner father had business over the river and left me to entertain him alone his visit was very pleasant indeed he converses so easily that one cannot feel embarrassed in his company he is very anxious to go to the war and thinks he will go said he would be back to see us tonight i must dress for supper now tis nearly dark and father must find me ready when he comes he did not know the dinner hour and came in so late that he had not time to eat his dinner night mr green came to tea has just left he has decided to go to the wars is elected captain but the company is not yet full
sunday june 1st 62 this is the first day of summer a summer which promises to bring sadness to us evils thicken around and the clouds are no longer gathering they seem about to burst god grant it may be with blessings not with cursings we hear news constantly of some weak rash act some cowardice some treason in our confederacy our enemies seem to be gaining ground but it may be a delusive dream but still i love to cherish i believe we shall prevail i believe that god has not and will not forsake us the yankee gunboats have commenced firing on vicksburg damaging some churches and private homes but nothing more father brought home last night a sermon of dr lord's on the last infamous proclamation of the yankee general butler it makes one's blood boil to read it can we believe that such men will prosper the war and public matters occupy my thoughts so much that i scarcely think of noting down the events of our quiet life this week however has not been so quiet as usual monday i spent the day with miss newcomb and miss bennett found carrie young there i enjoyed the day very much brought home some flower roots and cuttings and also evangeline and trelawny's last days of shelly byron the former i read yesterday there are many beautiful passages in it the latter does not deserve to mentioned in the same paragraph it is as far as i have gone hardly worth reading tuesday night father came home thursday evening we went down to see the misses bry who moved out this week this morning major bry miss puss and her brother and sister came to see us yesterday evening we had quite a little tornado and a heavy shower mr bennett who was on his way home from monroe stopped in from the rain he in a very pleasant man i gave him jackson's tallulah other poems to take to mrs bennett she is a georgian and every georgian's heart must warm over those poems yesterday evening father brought home a buggy it is a very nice little one and very convenient it seems strange for us to have a buggy we never had one before willie grandma and georgie have gone down to the mill in it this evening willie had a little flower bed fenced off for us last week and we have all been very busy in it this week we have a good many cuttings in it and some flower seeds planted sunday night june 8th father left us this evening he did not know exactly where he would go or how long he would be gone he may possibly go to richmond before he returns every thing is uncertain vicksburg still holds out we have heard many reports but do not know whether to believe them or not there is report of a battle near richmond in which we were victorious oh if it is but true they say also that jackson has crossed the potomac and that the marylanders are rising to throw off the northern yoke a gentleman of respectable and honest character who has arrived at monroe says that that infamous proclamation of gen butler's was issued in consequence of the ladies of new orleans have sent back the cards sent to them by mrs butler have americans come to this though his nation bears the detestable name of yankee still i blush for them thursday i rode mollie for the first time i can now mount her without fear and am delighted with her miss mary and willie spent the day at mrs noble's yesterday uncle moses and his family perfectly well
friday june 5th 63 here is a beautiful little poem a translation from the german which mrs morancy has lent me to copy sweet earth that holds my brightest treasure be wept upon by gentle skies blest grave that keeps the lovely thing from her sweet dust let violets spring dear winds that sweep the tiny bed breathe lulling music o'er her head hush thy wild voice of fear great storm fright not the little sleeping form beat not the turf to cause her pain weep quiet tears sweet summer rain weave thou a fairy shroud dear snow for the bright flower that sleeps below drop richly here sweet sun set bright and dress my child in raiment light green leaves make whisper o'er her rest and soothe her dreams on earth's cold breast o gentle water running near murmur sweet comfort to her ear build here thy nest oh sing dove mild talk softly to my lonely child dear dove make too a plaintive moan for the sad mother left alone oh white winged angels softly bear my darling up heaven's golden stair dear christ who lovest the little child take to thyself my undefiled i find many tastes and feelings in common with mrs morancy and like her very much i feel so irresistably drawn towards her i suppose it is because she has suffered so much and from what i can judge has been strengthened and purified by suffering nothing develops and enobles the heart and mind like sorrow received as from the hand of a tender father not an avenging god sometimes i begin to faint in the course i have marked out for myself i often feel afraid that i am not doing good to those to benefit whom is the aim of my life i suffer much from the thought that in the end harm may result from my best endeavours loring told me the other day in a passion that i never could teach him anything and he often says that i am not doing him good but making him worse scarcely a day passes that he or eva does not get into a passion with me and say things which cause me much pain and yet i try in every possible way to make them love me and to persuade them to learn how much need have we of faith and how true is it that it must be precept upon precept and line upon line i could be perfectly patient if i were only sure of the end often do i repeat to myself the texts overcome evil with good and those that continue unto the end shall be saved and there are some moments in which loring and eva repay me for all the pain they give lory especially has i believe begun to think lately of many things his questions upon the bible both surprise and delight me he never allows anything in our morning chapter to pass without explanation george too is advancing he knows all his letters and a few little words i do not let him study in those dull a b abs and b a bas but have put him to read in a little book of monysyllables my darling never refuses to come to say his lesson and though sometimes a little playful and unwilling to confine his attention to the book he is never in a passion with me and a few words of commendation or reproof will quiet him immediately my greatest fear for him is the want of truth i cannot rely upon what he says if it has at least a ground work of truth it is always exaggerated and many adventitious circumstances added to make up the picture i am afraid i myself have fostered this disposition by encouraging him ever since he could speak until during a year past to tell me stories which had no foundation whatever but which he told so earnestly that he almost believed them i thought that in acting thus i was cultivating his imagination i succeeded it is true but at the cost of truth and i deeply regret the course i pursued june is here at last long looked for as it has been but father has not come oh when shall we see him what would i not give to feel the touch of that hand again six almost seven months have past and we have not seen him oh what events have occurred in that time what a winter i cannot bear to think of it and yet it presses itself constantly upon me it seems now that the next month is big with consequences to our nation nay to the world we hear that four generals johnston and bragg and rosencrans and grant are concentrating large armies near vicksburg and we hear from the best and most direct sources that the yankee dead lie in heaps about our entrenchments it is horrible to relate sickening to think but so curious a fact that i must note it down all the vultures have left this country a carcass may lie for days untouched those creatures have gone eastward in search of nobler game how terrible is war while such great and momentous scenes are enacted so near us i feel hushed in awe and anxiously wait for the eventful future god grant that we may be successful i believe we are in the right yet who can know the inscrutable designs of his in whose sight a thousand years are as one day and as a watch in the night when it is past i am constantly occupied occupation is life to me and i find no lack of it visiting or receiving visits occupys most of my evenings after five and i am in the schoolroom from nine till dinner at one then generally a ride of an hour after breakfast is spent in riding and though i rise at five i seldom leave my room until a few minutes before breakfast at seven lately much of my time has been occupied in braiding and making a palmetto hat for adam young his sister made one for willie and i thought it only right that i should return the compliment this i intend to finish this evening and then i hope to have more time for reading i have read so little since father left and i had marked out so many books to finish before he returned i commenced the history of civilization by guisot the other day but have read very little i have been intending to write this journal for many days but have never taken the time until now i think sometimes i attempt to do so many things that they are all neglected tuesday june 9th 63 miss kate willie and i attended a fish fry on crew lake yesterday the party was very small only mrs willson's family mary stevens and miss sarah garrett and mrs proctor with a few gentlemen we rose at half past two rode into town and met the rest of the party at the cars at about five o'clock we spent the morning very pleasantly in the woods fishing walking and talking mrs proctor afforded me a great deal of amusement she is one of the gay widows whom one meets with so often in books has a large bunch of small curls on each side of her face and a net trimmed with bugles waving behind a complexion which is a happy mingling of brown and flushy red a hooked nose retreating forehead and a wide mouth always open and showing very good teeth her head dress yesterday was a black hat trimmed with blue ribbons over which was thrown a black lace veil which never descended to cover her face she has a nervously lively air talks in a high key and shakes her curls throws back her head and laughs at almost every word spoken either by herself or another her great affectation of youth ill accords with the number of wrinkles on her face and her general shriveled appearance yet with all this ludicrous and disgusting appearance and manner she seems to be generally liked so i suppose she must have some redeeming qualities we took the cars at about four o'clock and after a short ride of twelve miles reached shonroc where bidding goodbye to our friends we took the way home i heaved a sigh of relief as we entered the enclosure and drove up through the grove i felt perfectly exhausted by a day spent in the pursuit of pleasure even though the object had been attained this morning we commenced again our quiet routine though i felt little like it i am better now though do not feel so languid as when we commenced school loring accompanied us to the fish fry yesterday and today he felt so tired and his eyes were so much inflamed from cinders that i did not take him into school eva has given me some trouble this morning i was obliged to keep her in though i disliked very such to do so i wish she would take more interest in her studies yet i never punish her for anything except ill behaviour we heard yesterday that there had been a battle at milliken's bend between part of walker's brigade and a force of negroes mixed with a few yankees it is said that the yankees at the first onset left their allies and fled but the negroes fought desperately and would not give up until our men clubbed muskets upon them we lost three hundred killed and wounded and it is said there were three thousand of the negroes killed it is terrible to think of such a battle as this white men and freemen fighting with their slaves and to be killed by such a hand the very soul revolts from it oh may this be the last today i am to commence a regular system in the division of my time i find that i do not read any lately my time is taken up with other things and with so such company constantly coming in and going out so i have determined to set apart two hours every afternoon to reading and not to break my rule except on an extraordinary occasion we have had no rain yet and need it dreadfully the dust is stifling and if we do not have rain this week our prospect for corn will be ruined it is very warm now too real summer weather such as i like if it only were not so dry wednesday june 10th 63 at length it has come the long desired welcome rain all day long it has been alternately shower and sunshine and just now it was raining really raining oh how delightful to sit in my room all alone with my book hearing not a sound except the quick fall of the rain and looking out upon the freshening landscape smiling through its misty veil bless god for the rain the life giving soul refreshing rain and now though the drops fall more slowly clouds are over the sky and still from cloud to cloud returns the solemn hymn in the west a beautiful golden light shines through the trees and rises higher and higher in the sky what a refreshing smell arising from the grateful earth as it eagerly drinks in the much needed rain when looking on such a scene and breathing such air i unconsciously recall the scripture comparing the rain's coming to the thirsty earth with the mercy of god coming to the sinner's heart june 12th saturday oh how shall i write the joyful event of this evening father has
oakland june 8th wednesday it has been almost a month since i last wrote here and in that time i have been and returned from homer i cannot pretend to give anything like a daily record of my visit it seems to me like i had written it all and i would have done so had not every hour been filled up with visiting receiving visits or conversation except the many hours when an overwhelming weariness of body made one indisposed even for pleasure we left for homer thursday evening as we anticipated went only a few miles and spent the night with a friend and relative of mattie newcomb's mrs lawler we did not leave there until eleven o'clock the next morning journeyed on slowly until we came to a fine shady place near an excellent spring we were hungry and so chose this place for eating our basket dinner i felt very weak and sick but a little lunch refreshed so very much we took out our late yankee papers read some and talked more then slept a little and by that time antony was ready to hitch up the mules again our evening journey over hill and dale was very pleasant the day was not too warm the sun shone brightly the road was well shaded and we had a company of four young people bound on pleasant journey what more could we need ah youth what a priceless blessing it is would that i might be always young the country through which we travelled was very much like our own immediate neighbour poor and hilly but few fields and these few generally left uncultivated by the removal of their owners the houses far between and badly built towards sunset we came into a prettier and better country saw one or two very pretty little houses came up to col gilson's one of the few stopping places on the road it was early but it was seven miles to the next stopping place so willie went in to ask if we might stay all night they said they had a houseful of sick soldiers so we yielded of course and drove on towards vienna this is one of the poorest meanest little places i ever saw there is a so called hotel there but we had heard such accounts of it that we were by no means anxious to stay as we drove up the long hill on which vienna is situated we saw a man leaning on a large bay horse which stood at the side of the road without either saddle or bridle as we came up he turned a bold face to us and stared right into the carriage after we passed he turned again and continued his impertinent gaze until we were out of sight then mounted his horse side wise and passing us looked again whistling all the time we drove up to the only nice looking house in homer situated a little back in a garden the residence of a dr stuart willie went in to ask if we could stay all night a young woman came down the path evidently expecting an acquaintance she was dressed in white with flowing sleeves and had on a black silk apron her arms looked so cold and unfeeling when she said we could not stay it was now nearly dark as we turned from the gate we met the same impudent young man who again gazed at us in perfect disgust with homer we drove rapidly through the one little street by the time we reached the bottom of the hill the moon's pale light shone down on us we had then four miles to go we did not mind it much as it was a bright moon light and went on talking and singing until we saw the friendly lights from mr greens when we got out of the carriage we were three folorn looking women i was so tired that i could hardly stand we went right in through the narrow piazza to the parlor which was lighted by some pine knots in the fireplace mat and shep were acquainted with the family they introduced me but my name was not understood and as the old man took my hand he gave me a keen look from under his heavy black brows and said what did they say your name was when i told him he instantly remembered to have met my father he is said to be one of the richest men in jackson parish or indeed in this section of country but his surroundings are miserable the rooms at his house small and dirty the furniture of the commonest kind his daughter has been to school and has a very fine piano on which she plays tolerably and she also sings very well hanging up on the unceiled wall of her room were some very elegant dresses on a little table in the parlour were some very handsome books the fine bindings all spoiled with dirt the table was furnished with a variety and abundance far superior to ours but oh so badly cooked and served i could not bear to drink out of the dingy glasses and had no appetite for the greasy food handed on a coarse plate however we were very thankful for the shelter they were very much crowded but we slept very soundly three in a bed the next day we left as soon after breakfast as possible we had a delightful days ride through a beautiful hill country sometimes we would come to the summit of a lofty hill the road wound red and rough through the green woods an its side in the valley waved small fields of wheat and rye glistening green in the sunlight or lying darker in shade of the opposite hill a little stream ran across the road and beyond the hill rose in terraces below a wood of oak and hickory with their bright gleaming foliage and crowning the summit a ridge of dark pines rising distinct against the clear sky this sky was a deep blue with light shaded clouds floating in it and casting a transient shade on the smiling landscape beneath i have described one scene there were many others almost equally pretty sometimes the waving grain was exchanged for fields of young corn the road was very rough and much washed into gullys we were obliged to get out of the carriage and walk down most of the hills we ate a hearty dinner in the cool shade and then drove on to homer which we reached about sunset mrs bennet received me with cordiality i was exceedingly fatigued and was glad when the hour for retiring approached as usual the first night found me homesick and weary in the morning we were to go to church but churchill's division was passing the young ladies wished to see it and we did not go at dinner a very equisite note came from mr kimball inviting me to go to church with him that night or i should have said requesting the pleasure of my company i accepted and heard a very good sermon which my weariness prevented my appreciating i was so tired i had to stop just there and do not now feel like taking up the record again but must just say how delightful it is to be at home we only arrived yesterday evening i have been putting to rights today and now at the twilight hour everything in so pleasant in my room everything in the garden has grown beautifully my little flower garden is so sweet and my dear little geranium so luxuriant i wrote to valeria while in homer it was a painful pleasure mr gordon kindly sent the letter to mr cassidy who had promised to forward it thursday june 9th sunday evening i went up to mrs barr's was so glad to see them and met such a warm welcome i do love mrs barr and mrs morancy i never knew a lovelier character than mrs barr's i remained at mrs bennett's a week while there received a good many calls from different young ladies took several very pleasant rides one evening mr kimball called to accompany me i had a delightful ride a slight shower had just washed the dust from the trees and we went along a very pretty road we mutually exerted ourselves to please and discoursed at large on the beauties of nature he described several beautiful scenes in the white mountains and we found some places which we knew in common i have rarely met a pleasanter companion but he lacks that indefinable that subtle essence of manhood without which refinement culture and taste all leave a visible lack in a man the strength the decision and fearless uprightness of a true man what can equal it we had a little surprise party at mrs bennett's while i was there about fourteen ladies and more gentlemen were present the evening passed quickly and delightfully and three o'clock came before departure was thought of the stars were beginning to fade when i went to rest the next day i went to mrs barr's spent the day in company with major street he was probably fatigued from the party at any rate he was very dull i was enjoying one of my best days was neither tired nor sleepy that week at mrs barr's was one of great enjoyment to me it is delightful to be with those who never offend the taste by any lack of refinement towards whom the heart goes out in perfect trust and love such are mrs barr and mrs morancy to me i have but one dearer friend than they this dearest and best i need not speak her name my love my life the memory of the dead is linked with hers when i can see her again i shall have no concealments i have never gone to her and not met with the fullest love the most perfect sympathy i wrote her a long letter at mrs barr's but oh how poor and powerless is a letter when one has a whole year to speak of and such a year as this has been to me while at mrs barr's we borrowed shirley from mattie newcombe i read it aloud some parts of it spoke so to my heart that i seemed to breathe out myself in reading them the book has some great imperfections but i like it very much for all that mrs bowmar barr left with her husband for monroe the day after i went there she is now here has been staying with mother ever since she came down her baby in a very pretty and good little fellow i was much more pleased with julia while at homer than ever before she is not a friend in that high sense in which the word should only be used but her many good qualities make me like her in spite of the prejudices which were engendered by her surface faults the day after i expected father and miss mary i received a note from her saying that as father was coming from millhaven with one of the mules he was going to drive to shreveport the mule kicked up and struck father with his hoof on one side of the nose breaking the bone and cutting a great gash she wrote that father was getting much better and would be up soon that his principal trouble was about my disappointment and a fear of my being anxious about him i was indeed quite anxious but the next day friday as we were sitting reading after dinner the ambulance drove up with father and miss mary i was so glad to see them and rather was very much better though i was shocked at the swollen appearance of his nose and the dreadful gash all down one side of it what a mercy that he was not struck on the temple or in the eye it just escaped his eye father remained at mrs barr's until the next morning when he left for shreveport and marshall mr gordon was with him mr gordon told me that he had heard that mr ridgill had removed either to demopolis or selma mr tom williams a gentleman from homer was going across the river and i wrote two notes to valeria one at each of the above places and a letter to grandma and aunt mary miss mary and i went down to mrs bennett's saturday morning and remained till monday these two days were by no means pleasant saturday morning i spent in writing letters and was very much worried about willie in the first place i was worried about his being at homer and having nothing to do and in the second i thought i saw too much preference for shep bennett in his manner this combined with my physical weariness caused the day to be anything but pleasant to me i am so weak hearted and place so little real faith in god that i am often needlessly troubled with a few days these transient clouds dispersed willie had been ordered to remain in homer until particular orders could be received from col harrisson but was very much in hopes he would obtain leave to return the negroes to father and himself join his company i had reason too to believe that his transient fancy for shep had subsided but other causes of trouble remained far more deeply seated i find myself a second time disappointed in mattie newcomb i easily deceive myself and so slow of comprehension when she was down here i thought i could really respond to the liking which she so warmly professed i have no doubt that she in sincere in these expressions if i had i would not mind it so much but it is impossible for me to count her among my intimate friends she is so shallow her sentiment is of such a technical surface kind she sometimes offends my eye and ear by her manners or language and seems so wanting in religious feeling or in any of the deepest feelings of our nature she is not without many good qualities not without affection but there is throughout a lack of depth and discrimination that makes it impossible for us to mingle intimately i like her very well as an acquaintance but she speaks as if we were intimates she seems to desire it and her own expressions seem to have left me in some sort pledged to her if i break this intimacy shall i not myself seem to have been acting a hypocritical part i cannot tell her i feel deep friendship for her yet what can i say when she tells me so but let me leave the speculations for more apparent facts the week of miss mary's stay was divided between mrs barr's and mrs bennett's we spent one day with mrs scarborough i had been twice to see them before was very glad to meet them again tabitha is as kind as ever but her face has taken a still more pensive cast and her girlish beauty is much impaired i am afraid her married life is not happy her husband is an inferior man in every respect and is besides a gambler i do not see how she can either love or respect him on saturday evening we were delighted by seeing father again he and mr gordon spent the night at mrs bennett's father was very much fatigued his nose was much improved but one his eyes was badly inflamed the next morning we all went to church the sermon was not good and it was excessively warm father and mr gordon dined at mrs barr's and spent the night there we went up to tell mrs barr's family goodbye in the afternoon a rain came up on our return but the curtains of the ambulance were down and we did not get wet we had a delightful rain that evening it was very much needed and everything and everybody rejoiced in it monday morning we left as soon as we could on our way home it was a cloudy morning and when we had gotten about three miles we had quite a little shower about an hour afterwards the rain commenced again and just poured down it drove steadily against us soon the gullys at the side of the road were full of roaring streams here and there we saw a perfect waterfall while the road was just one sheet of water flowing on in waves of course our progress was extremely slow i did not get wet much miss mary and i were safe except our dresses which got a little wet and very much tumbled father was quite dry too but mr gordon and jerry were the sufferers they sat in front and although mr gordon had a blanket over his knees he got quite wet before twelve o'clock the rain ceased and when we found a good place we stopped to eat dinner in an hour or two we started again and plodded slowly on it was yet more than an hour before sunset when we came to mr green's the next stopping place was eight miles on but miss mary and i had such a distaste to stopping at mr green's again that we went on about a half mile on we met maj waddill he was going up to homer to meet his wife but when we told him that she was not there he said he would not go on but would probably come back to mr gibson's after a short business interview with mr green so we went on slowly it was almost sunset when we reached vienna mr gordon took the reins and drove as fast as possible the dark fell before we reached mr gibson's it was cloudy and not a star shed quivering light upon our uncertain way miss mary and i began to regret not having stopped at mr green's at length the lights from col gibson's shone through the thickening darkness maj waddill drove up almost at the same time with us said he would not impair father's chances of a lodging by going in at the same time father descended from the ambulance with many exhortations from us all to be very eloquent notwithstanding this his errand was unsuccessful he said we might stay if it were not for the young ladies so of course we had to drive on maj waddill was accepted we left him standing in the dark with i regret exceedingly ladies on his lips the next mile was over the muddy rough road in the dark jerry got out and walked ahead to find the bad places at length we came to the next inhabited place the lights burned faintly our suspense was dreadful while father held a parley which we could not hear what was our relief when we heard the welcome words gordon drive up here so up we drove guided by the voice the people were all gone to bed the gentleman of the house came out with a lantern by which light we descended and walked up the short path to the house i never was so grateful for a night's shelter in my life i was tired to death and when the young lady showed us into a little room with white curtains to the one window and a white counterpane on the plump bed i could not help giving vent to my gratitude there was a nice little white basin and pitcher and linen towels the room was only about twelve feet square but everything was so nice that miss mary and i were enchanted we had soon stretched our weary limbs and were fast asleep the next morning we had a very good plain breakfast everything neat the young lady of the house was quite a nice intelligent person and her mother and father were very kind they were very moderate in the charge only asked ten dollars for us all and the mules were well fed we were glad that we had not stopped at col gibson's which we hear is not a good place i forgot to say that mr gordon lost his mule at greenwood not far from shreveport it was very unfortunate but very fortunately they found a man in shreveport who had a horse he wanted to send to monroe so father put him in beside the other mules at mr mayfield's where we stopped all night jerry lost his knife which is a negroe's greatest treasure he was very such distressed about it after we started we found that he had had no breakfast and father took out our lunch basket to give him some ham and bread we had had a large piece of cake in it but when i lifted the towel which should have contained it there was none there at first i suspected father and mr gordon of having taken it for supper but they looked so innocently surprised that we had to suppose some negro had pilfered it everything else in the basket was all right as jerry munched his bread and meat he muttered bad luck mule lost knife lost cake gone pipe lost and like to turn over don't like to travel we all laughed heartily at his enumeration and concluded that poor jerry was next to mr gordon the greatest sufferer by the trip father it is true had broken his nose but flesh will heal we arrived at home by three o'clock were so glad to get here again the house looked so large and the parlour had such an elegant air to our eyes while i felt quite lost in the hall we found mr and mrs barr still here mr beck and miss mary had been to pay mrs barr a visit just left last week i was so sorry i could not have seen miss mary eva had been very sick with the chills and looked quite pale mother said she was so weak she could not hold up her head and miss beck nursed her like a sister loring too has had the chills since i left he looks badly but george and john are as well as ever george seems to have grown so much since i left i shall not commence school until monday am anxious for the day to come it has been showery both yesterday and today and quite warm this weather makes everything grow my little geranium looks beautiful thursday june 16th i have been intending to write here all the week but have not had time mother was taken with the diptheria friday evening and has been sick ever since the doctor cauterized her throat for the last time tuesday morning her case was taken in time and was not severe she has not yet left her room is still quite weak but her throat is well mr bowmar barr and his wife and baby left here sunday being afraid of the diptheria for their little one mrs barr went to mrs dortch's to stay until her husband could get a boarding place for her sunday night we were all very tired and retired early miss mary and i had not gone to bed when we heard the steps of two men in the hall we were slightly startled but they proved to be mr barr and his brother in law mr beck mrs dortch had no room for them and they had come here to stay all night they remained to breakfast i liked mr beck very much indeed he is not at all handsome mrs barr came to breakfast with her brother as he was going to return home immediately she went to mrs stubbs that day she is going to board there we were surprised by a visit from capt oliver tuesday he was on his way to trenton the post is at last moving down capt oliver stayed to dinner said that willie would probably be on that night so we expected him but went to bed disappointed i was gladdened the next morning however by hearing from rose that willie had come about ten o'clock i had slept so soundly that his coming was unheard he brought many loves from everybody and a very affectionate note from mrs morancy to me mother has been very much troubled for fear willie might have fallen in love with shep bennett i think she has no cause for uneasiness at one time while in homer i feared the same but i hope the fancy was fleeting she is too old for him and i don't think she would make him a good wife perhaps i hope too much for him it seems to me it would almost break my heart for him to marry her he has not been very well lately and has become thinner probably owing to the warm weather mr newcomb mrs bennett's oldest son called yesterday evening we kept him with us all night and he and willie left together after breakfast this morning father is not very well today had an attack of dizziness and could eat but little breakfast but insisted on going in to monroe we don't expect him back till after dinner it is very warm today we have not had a shower for two whole days saturday june 18th i happened this morning to glance at a portion of my journal written soon after the fall of new orleans how dark the times were then and oh how trebly dark there were this winter but now light has at last dawned and in such a bright promise of a sunlight day at last the tremulous hope of peace begins to flutter in our hearts we hear on every side rumours of victories in the south of disaffection and open rebellion in the north we have reason to think that this year something decisive may be done with prayerful anxiety we expect news from virginia and georgia where our noble veteran troops an contesting hardly for the great cause the yankees seem to be hurling all their strength on to crush our noble virginia army and possess richmond we have heard of bloody battles of brilliant victories but we know little with certainty our confidence in lee has never once faltered may he prove again victorious we have heard that a resolution has passed the lower house in the yankee congress proposing to open negotiations for peace this is too good to believe the four years of lincoln's administration are drawing to a close we have looked forward to this as affording prospects for peace and now the state of affairs in the north seem to justify the words of president davis last message in which he expresses an opinion that the war will end during the year long of ohio has made a speech in the federal congress in which he advocates in the boldest and strongest manner that the confederate states shall be recognized and propositions made for peace he frankly declares the right of secession condemns coercion as wrong in principle and effect and pronounces lincoln alike a fool and a knave all this in the forcible moderate manner which speaks conviction not passion to be the motive of his words if there were many such man in the federal congress our hopes would be assured from these great national interests which are so absorbing i descend to the small but to us important events of our own lives mother left her room for the first time yesterday morning she is not yet strong i am afraid this debility will cling round her all summer mr gordon came out thursday evening remained all night the next morning father went down to millhaven in the buggy georgie asked to go and father delighted him by consenting john then came with his petition and to our extreme surprise father again consented loring then put in his plea to go to take care of the two little ones and drive so father went off with a buggy full of little boys john looked so happy and cunning sitting up on the butter bucket willie now comes home to his meals and to stay at night he is having the hands out wood for coals down at camp qui vive about three miles from here i hope he will get out of this business some time or other he is anxious to leave but i fear something will happen to keep him there as i write i hear the noise of teamsters driving cotton wagons by two yankee boats have been to monroe ostensibly to take down the cotton which belongs to maynard a frenchman who bought it from the government and paid in government neccessaries but there is a clique of men about monroe composed of maj waddill mr ludeling capt crosely and mr barr and some others who are mysteriously intimate on the yankee boats and it is strongly suspicioned that they are carrying on some great rascality father says that he thinks it would be very well if every citizen were allowed to barter their cotton with yankees because then they would pursue their own interest and get what is more valuable than cotton but to allow sharpers to thus enrich themselves while honest men are debarred seems very wrong the second boat has not yet gone down and there is serious talk of burning it before it leaves monday june 27th we were delightfully surprised last friday by dr mcdonough's arrival he came while we were at dinner we were very glad indeed to see him he and father went in to monroe saturday the doctor did not come out till late in the evening he remained with us yesterday left this morning immediately after breakfast i finished plaiting jenny morancy's hat saturday sent it up today by berry one of the negroes who is going up with a wagon train i am not at all satisfied with the plait it in not as nice as i have done but i have been so long out of practice in braiding that it is difficult for me to do it i am going to commence making a pair of corsets for dear mrs barr this evening and then i have a hat to sew for willie and one for louis stevens and one for sandy after this i hope to be over my press of work for a time eva has had the chills again looks very badly her system is in a low state she imagines she has the diptheria and many other things i am very anxious about her health we have persuaded mother to take a trip up the country with her she contemplates leaving in a week or two both she and eva need the change they expect to take homer mt lebanon minden and vernon in their way loring has also had the chills but we succeeded in breaking them last week this morning we had a full school for the first time all my pupils did themselves credit it is very warm we begin to need a shower already though it is not more than four days since we had one we have been very much blessed in showers for the past month the vegetables are doing well we had okra soup today for the first time this summer one of our heliotropes is blooming prettily now my geranium is also doing well but the ants have eaten up half the bed of portulacca and i am very much afraid they will trouble my geranium father has been having the piazza floored in front of the house it is a great luxury to have it to sit on in the morning and evening though it is too sunny at this hour or at any time between seven and six o'clock it gives quite a different character to the front of the house we hear today of a new victory gained by lee over grant i hope it may be true and i believe it is we hardly recognize the possibility of lee's being defeated i think tremblingly of john and angus they must have been in these late battles if indeed they had not fallen before oh that i could hear from them tuesday june 28th i received two letters by mr newcomb yesterday evening one very affectionate and welcome from mrs morancy she tells me that she has at last in earnest commenced to wean jennie and that they are both much better for it i am glad indeed that this is so mrs morancy also writes that julia and miss creath expect to come down next week i wish it might be mrs barr and mrs morancy though i like julia much better than i used and shall like a visit from her my acquaintance with miss creath is very slight and has not left a favourable impression upon me my other letter was from mattie newcomb written in high flown style of sentiment with hardly a single rational sentence in it this is grievous to me i must do my best to preserve my own sincerity untainted oh my own dear friend if i could only receive one quarter of a page from you how much more precious it would be than a folio of those letters the fighting is still going on and my heart is anxious very anxious and sad mr barr was here to supper last night was on his way to homer traveled at night on account of the extreme best the heat of the sun is scarcely bearable it seems to scorch the blood in the house it is very warm it is cloudy today at intervals and we hope for speedy rain as i write i hear slight distant thunder mr gordon spent last night with us on his way from shreveport where he had been to get his mule he succeeded in getting it was called upon by the conscript officers told them he had always been willing to go into the army and would go anywhere if they would not conscript him they promised to write to him when they wanted him he has a natural deformity one of his hands is imperfect and this has prevented him from being in the army
july 7th 1861 sunday i have not written in here in so long a time because i have been hardly able to perform the manifold duties that have fallen upon lately and of course would not have felt justified in taking any time for writing since wednesday i have had a very bad cold for two days it seemed almost impossible for me to sit up indeed i did lie down all thursday evening yesterday and today i have felt much better poor miss mary is in bed yet saturday was the first day she has missed her regular chill and fever she is very weak and has grown very thin indeed she is much more nervous than we expected from her and is easily disturbed by noise though poor girl she cannot have much quiet we are so situated that it is almost if not quite impossible to get a moments perfect quiet during the entire day our little baby is very sick he has had a had cold all the week and was threatened with the croup all friday night saturday and last night today he is scarcely any better he is very weak georgie also has been suffering from a bad cold this week he is much better now mother has been sitting up since wednesday but has not been out of her room until yesterday she is now very well again father left us for new orleans monday evening and returned last night he is looking very well again father received a letter from mr john green while away he writes that his company is encamped near richmond to drill they have not as they hoped been called into immediate service but are being well prepared to fight when they do engage mr j green says nothing about his own situation or feeling but i presume that of course he is contented the fourth of july passed very quietly here my mind was so much occuppied by other things that i had almost forgotten the day there was a picnic some four or five miles from here i see by the papers that the day was kept with the proper decorum stores and offices were closed and closed and the appropriate salutes fired but there were no noisy demonstrations i think that the day should have been observed with unusual strictness but it is but natural and right that the feeling should have been more of sober thankfulness and religious prayer than of noisy joy we have had a nice rain this evening it is very refreshing for the day has been very warm aunt jane spent the day with us friday she was looking very well and was very pleasant there has been a comet visible for some nights past i went out to see it friday night it was very beautiful but its brightness was beginning to wane i was sorry that i had not been well enough to have seen it at first the rain has cleared away and the son is hastening to a clear setting this is the most delightful part of our sabbath it is a time when our thoughts are insensibly drawn away from earth and when looking at the declining sun we can almost think we see through golden vistas into heaven how delightful a quiet sabbath evening in its stillness arise thoughts that strengthen us to bear our daily burden through the busy week until the blessed season comes again but if the day has not been consecrated to god the calmness of the evening only affords a silent time when accusing actions can rise up against us and be heard well for us if we heed the warning of conscience now i realize lately how near death always is he can enter every where no precaution is able to bar him out why not then look death steadily in the face why not accustom ourselves to the contemplation of the grave as something which we must encounter and which we cannot destroy by looking away from it why not live in the constant rememberance that this is only a preparation and that our true life lies beyond then should we be ready for death and never need hush the whisper in soul that tells us the unwelcome truth death is ever able to intrude tuesday july 9th john is very much better he commenced to improve late sunday evening and has been quite bright since but is still pale and rather fretful mother thinks it is the cutting of his jaw teeth miss mary had another chill this morning she seemed very much better yesterday afternoon and sat up some time but this chill has prostrated her completely she is very low spirited too my cold is nearly well i feel better today than i have for a week i took salts yesterday and it completely freed me from the headache from which i have been suffering the past week i have been taking some horseback rides lately yesterday morning i rode out with father and this morning i went down to the mill with him we left quite early but father had a mule which he wished to shoe and this with some other duties detained him so long that we did not get back home until eleven o'clock we had a delightful ride for though the sun was shining very warm we came by a bridle path through the woods and did not feel the heat at all mrs nobles one of our neighbors called to see mother this morning she gave us a paper from the militart sewing society in monroe authorizing the ladies out here to form a branch society mother and i both signed our names the ladies are to meet thursday and elect officers for the society dr young's oldest son adam has returned from school for vacation i have not seen him yet he is younger than carrie sunday july 14th i have been so much occuppied by social duties since tuesday that i have not had time to write wednesday i rode down to the mill with willie in the morning and in the evning i went over to dr young's to call on miss marshall of vicksburg a young lady who is visiting carrie thursday was the day appointed for the meeting of our society i of course went mother was not able to leave miss mary we had a very pleasant meeting about twelve or thirteen ladies were present and we had nineteen names on our list the officers elected were mrs robles president miss josephine friend vice president miss bry treasurer and miss sarah wadley secretary the next meeting is a week from next thursday thursday afternoon i went down to see mrs adams and intended to go to major bry's but found his daughter at mr adams and consequently spent the evening there friday morning rode down to the camps with willie and paid a visit to mrs hodge adams in the afternoon went down to see the misses bry spent a very pleasant hour in the society of the family saturday morning the quarterly meeting at the methodist church commenced i went to church and heard a sermon which though neither elegant nor very tasteful did me good by giving new impetus to my endeavours to attain goodness after service the presiding elder made a few remarks about our sewing society for the soldiers and invited all the ladies to join it dr young who was present proposed that the gentlemen should all retire and leave the ladies unembarressed and said that the secretary miss sarah wadley who was present might then take the names accordingly the gentleman retired a pencil and paper was obtained and i received eighteen names some married ladies some unmarried two of the ladies paid me their admission fee one dollar each which i sent down to the treasurer this morning my position would probably have been very embarrassing had i not been slightly acquainted with a number of the ladies this morning i went to church again miss marshall went with me and i found her very agreeable she has been very well educated and has mixed with good society for two or three years the church was very full today quite a number of people were obliged to remain outside for want of room in the church the text was from romans upon christian duty the minister was very well at home upon this subject and preached a very good sensible sermon it was rather long and many persons complained of fatigue but i was not much tired the communion was administered to the white members and then to the negroes i thought the communion of the negroes was very affecting more so than that of the whites slaves seem so much more dependent their position in society makes their deportment so much more humble that it is peculiarly interesting to see them receive the spiritual body and blood of christ altogether service was to me quite impressive the surroundings were so novel a country church built of hewn logs blackened but not decayed by years a roof which high and pointed as it was served for a dome in the top of which spiders had woven their webs and dirt daubers built their nests unmolested by the occassional congregation windows without glass but having rude shutters instead hard wooden benches and a high square pulpit of plain boards without ornament of any kind was the church which crowned the summit of a low hill with the forest growth untouched by the axe of the settler from the windows we looked out upon a thick wall of green of countless beautiful shades and fluttered by cool south breezes turning our eyes inward they were almost pained by the light colors of dresses mantles and bonnets pure white bright pink and green blue and yellow quiet brown and somber black from the young lady dressed in neat fashionable summer toilet to the poor girl in her flowered caliko and green sun bonnet all the grades from a dowdy to the neat old country woman or her quiet daughter and over this heterogenous congregation presided the minister the circuit rider a tall sinewy man with black hair and iron grey beard who expounded the scriptures without the ornament of graceful attitudes or fluent speech but with energy and sincere plainness frequently wanting for a word but often propounded a startling question with perfect simplicity and clearness i have not been to church before in nearly six months and though it was differrent from what i have been accustomed to still i enjoyed it very much more than i expected willie has joined a company in trenton he drilled for the first time yesterday it is a home guard and will only leave in case of a call for more troops willie went to church with us this morning miss mary is very much better she has not had chill since tuesday she rode out friday for the first time mother and i went to mrs wilson's yesterday afternoon found her very pleasant wednesday july 17th father went to vicksburg monday and we expect him back tonight every thing has gone along very quietly this week mother and i went up to see mrs williams yesterday afternoon she is one of our near neighbors and is a very pleasant elderly lady i became acquainted with her at the meeting of our society i have taken my morning ride as usual every day this morning willie and i went along a delightful road through the woods it was in some places a rough bridle path and the leaves often formed a green canopy over our heads the beautiful beech tree grew abundantly in the low lands and on the hills oaks and hickorys threw their wide branches across the pathway all of them surmounted by the noble pine now lovely in its bright green summer attire i enjoy a ride through the woods so much there is to be a concert and supper in monroe tonight for the benefit of the ladies volunteer aid society i have been pressed to go by all my acquaintances around here and aunt jane invited me to spend the night of the concert with her but i thought it would be better for me not to go i have no appropriate dress to wear father could not be at home to go with me and though i should no doubt have enjoyed after getting there yet i felt no very great desire to go carrie young is one of the performers they expect to have very fine music today has been quite warm we have been expecting rain all day but i do not think it will come we are needing rain very much now but i should prefer on account of the concert that it would come tomorrow instead of today july 22nd 61 we have had a delightful rainy day we were needing rain and now it has been granted and in just the right quantity and manner this morning it showered a little and remained cloudy with a very few short intervals of sunshine until noon when a pouring rain commenced and continued for an hour it has been cloudy ever since and this rain with the moist atmosphere will revive the verdant green all around i hope it has been general yesterday i attended sunday school at church a bible class has just been formed and i was happy to have the opportunity of joining one we have not many members yet but will probably have more in time father returned wednesday night as we expected he left for vicksburg again this evening mother and miss mary went to monroe friday they spent the day with aunt jane at dr roane's found aunt jane very well our troops have achieved a great victory under beauregard the number engaged on either side is not known the enemy attempting to advance were met at bulls run near manassas and a severe battle of an hour ensued our troops gained a complete victory and the enemy retreated in confusion after a great loss it is said that we lost very few beauregard had a narrow escape the federalists having probably ascertained his whereabouts fired into the kitchen where he sat at dinner but he was unhurt strikingly illustrative of their disregard of the humanity so to speak of civilized warfare is the fact that they fired into the hospital over which the yellow flag was flying it is said that ten thousand federalists were repulsed by seven thousand confederates under general bonham and with great slaughter god seems to aid us he has thus far given us the victory how little can we forsee through the clouds of sorrow the loving hand which afflicts us in mercy and which will lead us safely to the serene light of lasting peace a year ago yesterday my beloved aunt breathed her last closed her eyes on the sorrows of earth and i trust passed into happiness oh how much better thus had she continued in life untill now how could she have borne the sight of war how could we have borne to see her surrounded by sorrows her very husband leading his children in the paths of fanaticism and treason soon alas to lead to anarchy or tyranny to have known that she and her brother were divided by impassible barriers this would have killed her better is it that she departed while all was outwardly peaceful when she might gather an undivided family around her and bid them goodbye in peace were she living now she would be to us worse than dead i have come to look upon her loss with resignation i hope to join her in the mansions of the blessed where there shall be no more dissension or sorrow but the great king shall reign in divine peace sunday july 28th 61 i have today to record a most splendid and complete victory achieved by the southern army we first received the news on tuesday but fearing lest it might not be authentic i waited till today to write about it we have now received full details the battle was fought last sunday commenced early in the morning and continued till after the darkness came on the number of troops on the united states side is said to be somewhere near 60,000 we had not more than 35,000 the battle was hard fought at one time our position was critical but a reinforcement came up and decided the day the enemy fled precipitately leaving their wounded and all their baggage and provisions beauregard and johnston commanded but davis arrived at the scene of battle at noon both beauregard and johnston displayed great personal bravery the loss of the enemy in killed wounded and prisoners amounts to from ten to fifteen thousand we lost about five hundred killed and one thousand wounded no prisoners our troops captured sixty one pieces of cannon besides a great quantity of arms and ammunition immense quantities of baggage and provisions it in said that general scott was near the field of battle in his carriage when they retreated he also left his carriage and escaped in one direction while the vehicle drove off in another the soldiers of our army captured the carriage which contained his sword and epalelettes a greater stigma if it were possible now attaches itself to his name the accounts given of the federal army are most disgraceful it is said that among other things captured were a number of bills of fare for most elaborate dinners to be given by mcdowell on his march to richmond col francis bartow of georgia was killed while heading a gallant charge of his regiment he was a brave man and a competent officer father was well acquainted with him the hand of providence is clearly seen in this victory god fought on our side and nerved the hearts and hands of our soldiers else we had not been victorious we are thankful for his goodness unto us miss mary eva and i went to sunday school this morning we also had a meeting for the purpose of testifying our thanks to god for this great victory dr young preached this was in accordance with a resolution of the confederate congress recommending the people to observe this as a day of thanksgiving all joined in praising the merciful providence of our god president davis message is all that we could have hoped from our hero statesman wise moderate and just in council cool brave and gallant in battle firm energetic and instant in the performance of his executive duties truly we have in him a second washington there is in his message nothing rabid or undignified his declarations are decided and explicit but mild almost to gentleness yet in the same paper which contains his message we read of him on the battle field charging at the head of his troops and mingling personally in the affray we had our second meeting last thursday but little was done we have not received letters from the volunteers and do not know what they want shall probably have some sewing soon willie has the chills and fever he was taken thursday mother has given him medicine and thinks she has broken the chills father went to vicksburg monday miss mary and aunt jane went in wednesday miss mary went to have her tooth attended to she expected to have returned the same night but was obliged to remain until thursday when she and father both returned mr robt green and his company leave for virginia the last of next week he said that he would be sure to come out and see us before leaving the first two or three days of this week were very cool but yesterday and today have been very warm monday july 29th 1861 today an accident happened which renders this day one of the memorable days of our quiet life mother and i were sitting here very quietly talking to carrie young who was over here when emmeline said miss sarah a gentleman is coming i immediately went to the door and to my great surprise saw a gentlemen in uniform at first glance i thought it was horace holton but i soon saw that i was mistaken and that it was a perfect stranger he came up and said that he would be much obliged if mother would have his horse taken out of the buggy and a saddle put on him as he was on special business for the confederate army and his horse would not drive while uncle jim was putting up the buggy the soldier sat down and explained himself to us his name he said was lieutenant hervey of president davis staff he had been traveling night and day on business to some companies at shreveport he would have gone through on the stage last night but he had confederate bonds to pay his passage with and the stage proprietors refused to take him unless he paid seventeen dollars in cash he then showed them his credentials and a paper from president davis respectfully requesting all heads of railroads and other public conveyances to allow lieutenant hervey to pass and take his acknowledgement as a voucher for the payment of the confederate states but not withstanding this they still refused to allow him to go he then thinking that he could do no more obtained a horse and buggy and started on his way this morning not however until he had written to the authorities giving an account of his treatment we were perfectly astonished at this behaviour from the stage proprietors i had not thought that there was any man in our midst who would not have speeded any of our soldiers on their way especially an officer of the staff and on particular business the young man lived in jefferson texas and went to the war as lieutenant in the orleans cadets he was first ordered to pensacola but afterwards removed to virginia he was in the skirmish in which col charles dreux was killed he himself narrowly escaped being wounded in the shoulder he was promoted twice until he reached the rank of lieutenant in the staff he was originally from columbus georgia his father was col hervey who was killed in the mexican war this young man is an only child and his mother a widow had it not been for the outrageous conduct of those stage proprietors he might have spent a few hours at home he has been absent six months and has not heard from his mother he says that the independent blues the company of which horace is saargent is at yorktown the ouachita blues are encamped near richmond he left richmond the day before the battle but received a dispatch from a member of the cabinet saying that the sword and epaulettes of scott also his carriage and horses had arrived in richmond and that the award was the same one presented to scott by the ladies of virginia what must be his feeling a traitor to his country a fugitive flying in a most disgraceful retreat hated and in disgrace both north and south we lent lieutenant hervey a saddle bridle and pair of saddle bags and bade him a most fervent god speed willie is much better today but is very weak he looks badly i would have thought a few days sickness could make so great a change father and i rode down to the mill this morning father took john in his arms and carried him along he was delighted with his ride for the first mile and then he went to sleep we called by mrs hodge adams they leave for texas tomorrow morning mrs adams is delighted to get away she dislikes this country greatly but thinks texas perfectly delightful father went to monroe after we returned he was not here to see lieutenant hervey i know he will be angry when he hears of the conduct of those stage people today is quite warm carrie young spent two or three hours with us this morning for the first time since she came home hitherto she has only remained a few minutes she has not been to see me before in three or four weeks mrs young has been sick she was over here saturday wednesday july 31st 61 my last entry was filled with the description of lieutenant hervey and his mission it is but fair that i should record father's reception of our story he merely laughed surprised at this we somewhat warmly asked what excited his mirth he said he was laughing at our officer on questioning him further we found out that he had met lieutenant hervey on the road and he thought from his appearance that davis would hardly have sent him on very particular business dr young says that the papers he offered to the stage proprietors were not confederate bonds but were spurious the dr also says that this same man was at bastrop last week he was also at the concert in monroe his story and his actions do not tally at all dr young says he is sure that he is an imposter father is not so sure that he is altogether an imposter but is fully convinced that his rank and mission are not as important as he represented them after leaving here lieutenant hervey went over to dr young's and borrowed a horse from mrs young after excited the sympathies of mrs y and mrs sthresthly he went on to a house about twelve miles from here and told the same exciting story he took the stage there and the gentleman of the house sent back dr young's horse and our saddle and bridle we have over to dr young's this evening mrs sthresthly looks very badly she no doubt suffers great anxiety of mind mrs young looks better carrie was at monroe she went tuesday we met a preacher a mr armstrong of the methodist denomination father sent for us about dusk to come home to see mrs williams who had called in our absence
july 13th 62 oakland a month since i have opened my journal book as i look back upon it it seems an age though the days and weeks pass as a dream the times are feverish and often my heart burns with anxiety and sympathy for our soldiers our noble soldiers yes i will say noble for erring and violent as they often are yet how many noble hearts are among them noble vicksburg i am proud of her she still holds out though the large yankee fleet before the city is constantly bombarding her many of the buildings are injured and some in ruins the court house is still untouched the yankees have landed at de soto and penetrated ten or twenty miles into the interior they have seized the negroes from many plantations along the river have about two thousand at work cutting a canal across the point opposite vicksburg so as to draw off the river from that noble town and thus ruin her prosperity their gunboats too want a safe passage up the river and even their gunboats feel a slight distaste to passing vicksburg there was a youth here today who carries the mail from here to the other side of the river he goes on horseback crosses when he can find the river free from yankees and changes his route according to circumstances his recital of his adventures made me think of the old revolutionary times he says that some of the negroes which the yankees have are very desirous to return home they release them on parole of honnour one of the negroes who got away said that they never would catch him any other way but running the negroes say that they have to eat in the ditch where they work and never come out except to sleep when they are sick the yankees send them off to a ginhouse near by and do not give them any medicine many of them are taken with the sunstroke they have a guard over every twenty four negroes they have got the canal dug fifteen feet wide and four feet deep they cannot get the water to flow into it the current is so swift the river is falling fast we have gained a victory in virginia we have not heard the particulars yet it was reported that mcclellan was captured but that has been contradicted mr dwight has been here since i wrote last he came the 12th june stayed two weeks we were all very much pleased with him he and mrs dwight have bought a place about a half mile from here misses newcomb and bennett spent the day with me thursday many of the summer people are out here now all the houses are occupied except mrs drake's she is at her father's within a mile of us we have for neighbors dr young mrs williams mrs dortch mrs temple mrs richardson mrs fe ohl mrs wilson and major bry's family the fourth of july willie and i spent on crew lake with a small party maj bry and miss puss mrs wilson and daughter miss black miss bright capt former capt martin lieut holmes mr douglas mr shields willie and i the lake is about thirteen miles from monroe willie and i rose at three o'clock and left home at four the ride into monroe was delightful when we started the stars were all brightly shining and venus more beautiful than all the rest shone just before us gradually the rosy tints of dawn began to appear and grew brighter and brighter until one by one the stars faded away and as the rays reached higher and higher venus as if reluctantly mingled her radiance with theirs as we stopped on the bank the river lay before us so silvery so beautiful just waving with ripples the murmur from the just waking town came to us from the opposite bank and soon the sun rose in his glory it is a sight i do not often see and it was well appreciated we rode out to the lake on the cars spent a very pleasant day catching fish rowing on the stream talking and lounging under the shady trees and eating dinner willie and i reached home at dusk father did not go to richmond he sent mr maguire in his stead father has been quite sick for the last two weeks his sickness was brought on by exposure to the sun he was walking on the railroad track between two breaks when he was taken with vomiting and vomited for half an hour at length he dragged himself under a woodshed and lay there all alone for three or four hours when a hand car came along took him up and carried him to a house he stayed there a day came home took to his bed and did not rise for a week he has been into monroe now twice but still looks very pale willie has not had a chill in a long time we hope he is getting well bernard is dead mother received news of his death about the middle of june mother is anxious for grandma to come to her but she cannot come on account of the yankees being in the way the weather is very warm and dry now we have not had rain in a long time a month every thing is drying up willie will not make any corn the thermometer stood at 98 today at four o'clock even the dogwood trees are dying from the drought thursday july 18th 62 oh we have had such a delightful rain yesterday it rained all day so softly that it penetrating the parched earth without washing the soil off today it has been showering a little everything looks so beautiful the trees are so green and seem almost to speak their thanks for the rain mr dwight returned today and we have not had any school this evening i have been writing a french translation for tomorrow and can hardly write correct english now i have commenced to make the acute and grave accents quite often since i began this captain smith came down yesterday morning he does not look very well is anxious about his son who was in the battle of richmond he is in jackson's division had been when his father last heard from him marching for thirty days often twenty miles a day and had a fight nineteen days out of the thirty father et capt smith left this morning before the break of day father went off on the cars he will to back saturday we did not wish him to go fearing that it would make him sick but he said he must start the repairs of the road the commanding general at monroe has ordered the repairs to be continued they had been stopped so that the road might not afford facilities to the yankees in penetrating into the country but the general says it is necessary to transport troops over the road a large body of calvary from texas passed here the other day we waved to them miss mary was in the grove waving and hurrahing one cried out to her i will bring you two yankees home i will not thank you for so few as that she said he replied enthusiastically god bless your little jeff davis rebel soul a characteristic dialogue characteristic of the time ah we almost froget humanity now and applaud sentiments at which in other times we would have wept peace how beautiful thou art i never the happiness of peace until i felt the bitterness the weariness of war now the peaceful seems to as a dream and yet even in the midst of war we may have inward peace sometimes i realize this and though i mourn for my country mourn for my loved ones yet i feel sometimes as if i have known an inward conflict a conflict of passion and duty of good and evil far more difficult to bear that even this heavy heavy burdun it is not only the present it is the future i think of i am seldom aught but hopeful and trustful but yet i often feel an anxious dread for my country i fear evil to her not from foreign ennemies but from internal faults oh may these fears be groundless may southern liberty yet triumph over every obstacle to her greatness
wednesday july 1st 63 i have neglected my journal for so long that i do not know now where to begin there is so much to write a day or two after mrs stone left we had an application to board some one even the fashionable mrs amos or rather the rich mrs amos and daughter and two servants mother refused of course they are staying with mrs dawson a friend and they have a place in jackson parish and are not distressed in any way our intercourse with them has not been very pleasant the first time i saw miss amos was the morning she called here with her mother to get board i thought her agreeable and sensible when i called on her as usual i was less pleased she has not returned my call and i suppose will not do so monday night i was invited to spend the evening there at first i wrote a note declining but afterwards at mother's advice destroyed that and accepted i was quite sorry that i did not adhere to my original decision i arrived there when the moon was shining brightly just at that charming hour when moonlight and twilight mingle but the young ladies were at the toilette i remained alone about fifteen minutes when mrs amos and virginia returned from a ride and gave me the pleasure of their company for nearly an hour when dr strother and lieut murdock drove up in a short time the young ladies appeared one after another almost forgot to bid me good evening and occupied themselves no more with my entertainment there were no other young ladies there except myself carrie young had been invited but was away from home and of course did not come there were six gentlemen there from town and the evening passed away tolerably i do not think that i shall ever accept another invitation at that house or visit except very formally the wife and daughter of captain jesse smith were here yesterday and the night before they left this morning appear honest good and frank hearted people but oh so fat miss smith weighs two hundred and fifty pounds and is only seventeen she is really immense and it is a actual fat too i pity the poor girl she feels it too they invited me very cordially to come up and pay them a visit perhaps i may they are very comfortably established with fine orchards garden and everything around them but still there is a certain magnetic repulsion which makes me shrink from the thought of spending my time in their company this shrinking from anything coarse or inelegant in mind or manners is so strong in me that i don't think i can ever overcome it i have too great a love for elegant surroundings and am in danger of confounding the spiritual with the merely earthly and so letting the earthly triumph this morning we went to major waddell's to attend the funeral of his baby and his brother's but in consequence of some mistake in the coffins it was deferred till this evening it was a sweet and affecting sight the two little frail forms lying side by side in angelic repose a veil of white thrown over them hid whatever was disagreeable in their features all was beautiful and peaceful one could imagine them soaring thence to heaven the two little cousins both girls were nearly the same age affected by the same symptoms and died within twenty four hours of each other mrs dr waddell was quite resigned but her sister law grieved much for the departed little one mrs morancy and mrs bowmar barr went to the funeral this evening the other two ladies remained there all day i returned home this morning with a violent headache which was just going off when they left so i did not accompany them willie returned from the salt works last thursday after an absence of a week yesterday he and loring went to the flour mills at downsville sixteen miles from here to get our wheat ground but the mill was out of order and could not grind this week so they returned today we have not had any school for the past two weeks first on account of father's return and last week because we expected mrs barr to leave daily and mother said i had better not have school but i shall endeavour to commence next monday father has been spending every other day for more than a week in the blacksmith shop one day he is president of the road the next takes up his old familiar trade he is repairing the wagons and the carriage getting everything ready in case we should have to move we have not yet heard any decisive news from vicksburg there was a great victory reported to have taken place there but we have not yet heard it confirmed and consequently can place no reliance on it we had a sick soldier with us all last week or rather a convalescent he was an honest quiet and modest person seldom conversed but was very sensible his name was john scott the man who brought him here said he was a good and faithful soldier never lagging or feigning sickness he expressed a great desire to get back to the army saturday july 4th 63 i really had forgotten or rather had not thought that this was the eventful fourth until i wrote the date of this entry alas we have no time now to celebrate the birthday of a liberty which we had nearly lost and are now struggling so hard to maintain i have heard nothing of any celebration today we have little heart for it now little heart for any joy even the purest which brings so powerfully to our minds the glorious past but is at the time associated with thoughts of our bitterest foes mr scott returned day before yesterday he was taken sick again and looked almost as badly as when he first came but i must note the extraordinary event which took place yesterday about half past twelve o'clock we were all sitting down quietly in the hall sewing braiding palmetto busy in a great many ways in fact we were so busy talking and working that we did not as usual hear the gate latch or the rolling of wheels until loring ran up saying here's an ambulance here's the staff we were indeed surprised they came up so suddenly that we had no time to dress at all mother was dressed in a purple morning gown trimmed with white very pretty and neat but not fit to receive gentlemen in we all looked quite as well as could be expected but if we had not there was no help for it for before we were aware of their neighbourhood the ambulance had stopped and the elegant major mason was approaching the door mother had only time to whisper and major mason too as she advanced to receive him he was accompanied by capt gault and capt french the last a nephew of my favorite the major i was very sorry he had not come instead of the nephew of course mother the housekeeper thought at once of her dinner expecting of course they would remain under this mistaken idea she came out into the hall when they had been there about half an hour and asked if the gentlemen would not like to wash their faces after their dusty ride the poor gentlemen were much embarrassed i dare say they thought their faces were dirty major mason recovered himself with his usual quickness and jumping up said in a rather flurried manner thank you ma'am as far as i am concerned it would give me a great deal of pleasure poor capt gault thought he must follow in his excitement be rose hemmed and blushed looked first at major mason and then at mother and then swung off to the room behind maj m and capt french it was really a most amusing thing to think they should have dressed up in their best maj mason especially in clean starched and trimmed shirt buttoned with costly and beautiful studs his hair brushed just so and particularly parted behind fine ring on his finger and his whole person redolent of perfumes and withal a face cleansed or every spec and in this toilet come to call on the ladles and indulging in a fine flow of eloquence to be asked unceremoniously to wash his face no wonder he was surprised out of his usual elegant self possession but mother was perfectly innocent his toilet was lost on her she asked him to wash his face as if he had been a common soldier i dare say they had a good laugh when they reached the cool seclusion of my room my room too only think of it i was really provoked when i saw them filing in notwithstanding this little mistake their visit was very pleasant a few minutes before dinner was announced they rose to go but we asked them to remain to dinner and they very readily consented and remained some time after i enjoyed their visit a good deal particularly as it was quite a surprise and a very unusual thing too novelty gives zest to anything i was really surprised as well as gratified during their visit by a little episode which displayed capt gault's character in a more favourable light than i had before regarded it this was as follows we were speaking of the wounded soldiers in monroe and their desperate condition deprived as some are of both hands or both legs i said i had rather die than live thus yes he said if mortal hopes and pleasures were only to be consulted but the question would always rise what must come after death so entirely unexpected was this from one whose character i had conceived to be so dissolute and thoughtless as his that i could scarcely answer he went on to say that it was a feeling so deeply implanted in a man's heart by his mother that he could never forget it that it was the one remembrance of a mother's teaching which he had never cast off but which often returned to his and the more bitterly as he had no doubt what his final destination would be this last was said in a light tone as if ashamed of his former seriousness but when he brushed his hand over his eyes and forehead i thought they were not very calm though he soon returned to subjects of conversation both distasteful and uninteresting to me i think that he is perhaps a man of really good mind and originally good feelings but in conversation with young ladies feels himself obliged to conceal the former by a display of dissipated frivolity as to the latter his good feelings appear to have been either perverted or smothered by frequent disappointments and by a life that has been by no means pure oh how soon i have learned the sad lesson that sin is indeed in the world i would i were innocent of this knowledge oh for the spotless purity and ignorance of hawthorne's white souled hilda i have learned the bitter lesson too soon and too well the sin of adam presses sorely upon me i cannot read the story of his fall without sadness almost tears it makes me sad to think of the situation of our country particularly of poor louisiana at this time there seems too be no law or order on this side the mississippi all is in confusion father is now involved in a controversy between civil law and military tyranny a week or two ago capt oliver the commisary at monroe sent word to father that the cars must leave early sunday morning to carry some necessaries to the camp at delhi this was not the day for the cars and father went up to see capt oliver ascertained that the provisions were not ready and that it was not necessary they should be sent until the regular train day he then explained to the commissary that the railroad and the engines were wearing out that they could not bear a daily train and finally that he could not send it out about nine o'clock they sent a courier out here with an order to send the train or the railroad would be pressed father remained firm to what he considered his duty and that night they did press the road mr mcguire refused to serve them they threatened him with arrest mr myrick and mr mckinney the engineer were told to run the train or go into the conscript camp they chose the former but the commissary soon tired of his bargain the train went down sunday but none of the indispensable articles were carried and during the day seven messengers were sent to mr mcguire to prevail on him to receive the railroad again he told them that as they had no right to take it so they had no right to deliver it to him but finally said that if it was abandoned he might take possession it was immediately abandoned father instituted a legal process against the seizure which has no warrant in either civil or military law no man is willing to do more for his country or to sacrifice more for it than my father but no man is more firm in resisting tyranny or maintaining those rights which make our country dear last week the trains had gone to delhi to bring walker's division to monroe but on receiving a contradictory order from general smith they were to disembark col randall commanding a brigade in the division sent a peremptory order to the conductor to back down he replied that would do so as soon as the train was ready but the engineer said in a low tone not meant for the ears of the official we don't obey gen'l randall here if he had requested us to back down we would have done it this idle speech was reported to gen'l randall and he had mckinney put in irons and lodged in the jail saying that he should remain there for the rest of the war was not this an outrage on liberty i heard however that gen'l walker had ordered the man to be released but yesterday he was still in jail and mr ray had gone down to compel his release as an officer of the civil law father was very angry when he heard of this tyrannical proceeding he was indignant that such should have happened in our own country it reminds us of lincoln's proceedings tuesday july 7th 63 mrs noble and annie paid us a visit yesterday they stayed all night and left this morning annie is growing to be quite a pretty girl last night twenty soldiers recruits from texas to walker's division camped at our gate they came up to borrow cooking utensils mrs bowmar barr was playing on the piano quite late and three of them came up to hear some music it was such a good trait in their characters i thought like all the soldiers we have ever met they seem well behaved we hear bad news from vicksburg some say that it has fallen some that it is about to fall i can only hope and trust oh god desert us not in this our extremity all is dark and uncertain we cannot look into the gloomy future even a day willie and his wagons leave for shreveport today they are going for coffee and also to take some wheat to mill at minden not far this side of shreveport loring begged so hard to go with willie that mother consented he seems to anticipate a great deal of pleasure on the road it is a new thing to him father has gone into monroe today but will be in the blacksmith's shop tomorrow he keeps working steadily putting all the vehicles in running order in case we should have to become refugees in our turn mrs compton and maggie paid us a visit yesterday afternoon julia was out riding and stopped to see me i really envied her when i saw her galloping by i have not mounted mollie for a month or more her back is healed up now and i am only waiting for the hair to grow out well before i commence riding her again i dare say i shall have a hard struggle with her at first she has been so long running wild and this is not necessary for she is never tame thursday july 9th 63 willie and loring left for shreveport tuesday we miss them very much indeed it seems like a week since they left it is hard to bid anyone goodbye in these times mrs barr mrs morancy and miss julia left us yesterday morning to visit mrs mahier a friend of theirs in jackson parish they expect to return saturday our family is very small now and the house feels lonesome mr scott is still here he improves but slowly we were very busy yesterday finishing an organdie dress which miss kate stone gave me it looks very pretty and is very becoming to me there were some tableaux and charades last night in town given by the young ladies for the benefit of the hospital mrs stevens invited miss mary and i to stay all night at her house but we had no way to go father is busy working at the carriage again today he has nearly finished it thursday night vicksburg has fallen vicksburg our hope and pride oh it is terrible we would not believe it until today but now it seems certain oh god have mercy upon us have mercy upon us all is dark all hearts are sad this is the worst blow we have had we hear that it was surrendered on saturday morning at ten o'clock the fourth of july hereafter a day of mourning and humiliation to us of redoubled exultation to our hated enemies oh it is bitter after all our confidence thus to have the yankees threats and prophecies fulfilled they say that our soldiers had no bread for two months and lived on mule's flesh for a month before the surrender i do not know what is true but it is all the fault of gen'l pemberton and his subordinates one thing we know vicksburg is gone that is enough sunday july 12th a soldier is here from vicksburg left there on parole on the eighth says the city surrendered for want of provisions a mule was killed for meat to his knowledge he says oh i am bowed to the dust with humiliation when i think of it my god my god why hast thou forsaken us i cannot be resigned to thy will in this it is too hard our pride our bulwark is gone this is the end of our confidence and boasting and it is the fault of our own generals well may every true patriot execrate the name of pemberton the yankees are advancing on delhi our forces are preparing to fight them oh for victory all is dark i cannot look ahead i shudder to think of the future should the confederacy fall i feel i can never know joy again but it cannot must not fall we fight for honour liberty life itself we shall yet redeem our name our former glorious name only this morning the calm brightness of the sabbath invigorated my saddened soul i trusted in god and i will yet trust in him from whom cometh my salvation thursday july 16th 1863 mrs barr and family returned monday morning they found eva sick with diptheria she was taken saturday evening with sore throat but she so often has it that we thought nothing of it but sunday she was so sick that we sent for the doctor he pronounced it the dreaded diptheria eva was very much frightened and allowed him to cauterize her throat and took the medicine he left without any resistance yesterday evening the doctor said her throat was much better she has the disease in a very mild form little jim was taken with it tuesday has it quite badly i hope it will not spread among the little children mrs morancy was so much alarmed for jennie that she took her down to mrs waddell's miss julia is there too so we have only mrs barr with us our salt wagons arrived tuesday noon said willie and loring were well when they left there all the government stores are being hauled from monroe so the wagons did not return and we expect willie and lory the last of this week i am very anxious to see them yesterday miss mary and i packed the books oh it was a sad work to me it brought forcibly to my mind all the hopes the bright golden dreams i had indulged in here and which were many of them connected with these books i had thought i should never again have the melancholy task of packing them oh my home my dear home how can i leave it it seems as if it would break my heart and i know i shall never return never see this place except as the dwelling of another it may be an illusion but in my eyes it is a beautiful place and i had projected so many improvements and than the bitterest thought of all is vicksburg had it not been for this we need not have left home but gladly would i have gone if this bitter humiliation could have been spared us miss mary and the children look forward with bright anticipations to their journey to texas and residence in san antonio de bexar but i have no bright anticipations usually so fond of weaving bright joys in the future i cannot now look forward a mist shuts in my mind like the mist which has hung over our hills for several days only the past is ever present with me i know these feelings are wrong how many have suffered more than we have mrs barr for instance deprived of her two sons the one her pride and stay the other her pet and darling her daughter a widow her surviving son with no talent for business and little energy she has lost much of her property and knows not where to go or what to do we are still united i feel this blessing and am thankful saturday july 18th 1863 georgie my darling was taken yesterday evening with the diptheria we sent immediately for the doctor but he could not come till late and as georgie was asleep and had no fever he would not disturb him to look at his throat i hope he will come early this morning father was not at all well yesterday retired before supper we had a joyful surprise yesterday in the return of willie and loring it was very unexpected indeed willie returned immediately from shreveport he could not get any coffee except at six dollars a pound by the sack they would not sell a smaller quantity so he did not get any not knowing what a panic might be in monroe by the time he returned major maclay and major mason called to see us last night major maclay as usual was very entertaining notwithstanding he was suffering from neuralgia in the face he told me some very interesting things about texas and san antonio which i shall lay up in my memory father did not see the gentlemen as he had retired and was so unwell julia willson and tabitha scarborough called here yesterday evening on their return from a horseback ride i was very glad to see them they are on the eve of moving to homer and thence to texas i shall be very sorry to part with them i have few such pleasant acquaintances this side of the mississippi but we are going so soon it matters little i dare say we will meet again in some of our wanderings monday july 20th georgie's throat was very much inflamed but proved not to be the diptheria he is as well as usual now the doctor is here this morning at work at jim's throat he says it is not necessary to cauterize eva's throat again she is fast getting well sat up all day yesterday and is up and dressed this morning but she looks badly and is still careful of her diet we took a ride in the carriage saturday evening principally to give eva an airing it was delightful riding as we returned home miss carrie young and capt gault virginia dawson and capt smith on horseback overtook us we did not see the last couple but carrie and her cavalier seemed enjoying themselves highly father had a fever yesterday and sent for the doctor but he was sick and could not come this morning he is up though feeling badly and mother gave him a dose of medicine before the doctor came the troops from the convalescent camp passed here yesterday there were seven here at different meals through the day in the evening two surgeons called in their pretext was a drink of water but they stayed some time after they had gotten it one was dr head who called here one night for supper while the troops were camped at trenton the first time the troops are going by today i hear some wagons passing now they are in different health and different spirits from when they passed before no wonder poor fellows mr scott was here to dinner yesterday said be was no better than when he left sunday july 26th 1863 today i have had once more the pleasure of hearing the service and an excellent sermon from the lips of an episcopal minister mr lawson of bastrop mrs dortch told us last week that he was to preach at monroe today and i was of course anxious to go miss mary eva willie loring and i went in it was exceedingly dusty and very warm but i was amply repaid for the long and wearisome ride for the pleasure i had in church it is the first time in more than two years since i have been in any church but this one here and my emotion amounted almost to pain as the impressive service commenced and the music of the melodeon how sweet and solemn the text was what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visiteth him and well was it treated oh how i felt my own nothingness my selfishness and vanity while i listened and more than all these i felt the grace and mercy of god grace of which i am so unworthy i caught a very bad cold on friday and feared i should not be well enough to go but this morning when i rose i was surprised and thankful to find my head free from pain and my cold almost gone rose was taken with the diptheria yesterday i hope she will not have it badly she is very patient a great contrast to jim who will not allow any thing to be done for him except by force he is very sick and very sullen he is extremely reduced looks dreadfully john is not at all well he either has a very bad cold or some kind of cough mr lawson said today that the hand of god was above this dark war cloud hovering over us and that it is he and not man who controuls the fury of the tempest i know it and i will trust in him surely he will deliver us and if not if it be his will to take from us what is dearer than home friends or life itself our country can i not believe that our father doeth all things well i will try thus to believe oh lord help thou mine unbelief tuesday july 28th 63 this morning the two wagons left for marshall one loaded with my piano and the books and the other with railroad things mr burks a railroad overseer went with them father will follow in a day or two to find some place of deposit for the things i had hoped never to have seen them moved again but all these hopes are now dashed to the ground the books were never put upon the shelves intended for them all is so uncertain where will they be unpacked if father carries out his scheme of sending us all over to germany we shall not have a home soon again this idea of going to germany is terrible to me to be separated from father and willie and from valeria i am separated from her now it is true but not by oceans oh if i could only see her before we leave home or if i could but hear from her jenny morancy is very sick i hope she may be spared to her afflicted mother thursday night july 30th poor little jim died this evening without pain and almost imperceptibly the spirit passed to him who gave it his body lies still and cold in the room where he suffered and the singing of the watchers now sounds solemnly there how closely are life and death bound together death is ever near the thought fills me with no alarm for myself but for those so near to me it is dreadful how much we feel our own littleness when we see the breath dying out of the body but now so full of life no man can save his brother here mortal love and anguish are of no avail
saturday july 9th 64 it has been nearly two weeks since i have written here two very busy weeks they have been to me mrs bowmar barr has been with us since saturday she came out to spend the night and next day but we persuaded her to stay until her husband came she expected him tuesday but he did not arrive here till this morning they expected to leave this evening but it is raining now and probably they will not leave this is such a refreshing shower such a grateful smell comes up from the thirsty earth for though we have a shower almost every day the sun is so hot that it soon dries the ground i have rarely felt a more oppressive month than the past june has been i received a note from mrs morancy last monday saying that julia was very ill and had had a congestive chill mr barr's protracted absence made us very uneasy but we were relieved this morning by hearing that julia was convalescent and expected soon to be able to come down to see us mr gordon came out today to have his horse shod he expects to go to georgia in two weeks father thinks something of going with him we would miss him dreadfully but i am anxious for him to go i know the trip would improve his health and spirits and then if he went i should be certain of hearing from valeria once more mother expects to leave for her excursion into the country on wednesday eva had another chill a few days ago but kept off the next by taking quinine loring's health is still bad and his chills return often he and willie went up the river this morning willie was going up on a flat boat for government corn and lory begged to go with him and as mother thought it might do him good she consented they expect to be gone about a week i have been suffering much for the past week from boils today the second one has attained it's maximum and i am suffering acutely from it am scarcely able to sit up i finished mrs barr's corsets the first part of the week although i took a great deal of pains with them i yet feel so sensibly how unworthy they are her wearing that i am timid about sending them i finished lewy stevens hat today and commenced willie's but have been too unwell to sew much on it the rain still continues a delightful summer rain it cools the air so much i heard today that charley compton was seriously wounded but had recovered enough to go home what a sad and thankful rejoicing his arrival will create wounded maimed any way if only not killed tuesday july 12th 64 after writing the above last saturday i found my pain increasing so much that in an hour or two afterwards i was obliged to go to bed i was reading the last days of pompeii commenced it soon after i came home and have not yet finished it and thought this a good opportunity to read some while i lay there groaning and reading by turns i heard a great hubbub and up drove mrs stone miss kate and jimmy i was very glad to see them we were surprised but not very greatly so as mr barr had told us that they were in homer and expected to come down the next week mrs stone looks older as is natural she should after so much trouble but she is as loquacious as ever talks constantly and very cheerfully with a compliment in almost every sentence miss kate seems just as if she had only gone away yesterday jimmy is quite changed has grown a great deal and is very manly i like him very much he has come in to join the army sunday i rose for breakfast but was obliged to lie on the couch afterwards and finally to go to bed in much pain my boil burst about twelve o'clock which much relieved me mr scott the president of the western division of this railroad came in on the stage just before breakfast spent the day with us he is a quiet pleasant gentleman a little older than father he came in on railroad business mr gordon left soon after breakfast monday morning we all went into town mrs stone miss kate and jimmy in their conveyance and father mr scott and i in the carriage i spent the day at mrs stevens enjoyed the day very much mrs stevens looks very badly has been sick in bed seven weeks is now better and sitting up mary does not look very well either i met mrs copely and her daughter george a young girl of fourteen and very vivacious and pretty called at mrs mcguire's on our way home to leave a book and get mrs mcguire's clock which father is going to mend mrs mcguire lent me madame de sevigne's letters for which i was much obliged mrs stone and miss kate went out into the swamp yesterday they will return in about a week to pay us a visit jimmy left this morning father is gone in town again today is a member of the grand jury mother leaves tomorrow is busy getting ready now thursday july 14th mother and eva left yesterday morning we miss them so much last night we were very lonesome indeed willie and loring are still absent and this makes us feel it more but i am so very busy all day looking after the children and susannah our new maid that i don't have time to be lonely until evening mother took rose with her and the woman that we have in her stead is quite ignorant of her new duties and requires a great deal of looking after but she is apparently willing to learn and does very well monday night father brought me a letter from lois and grandma it was dated last april is the first line we have received from georgia since last august the letter was such a surprise and we were so glad to receive it and to learn that they were all well but grandma is feeble and i am now more than ever anxious to see her lois did not say anything about uncle david's family but i know they were well else she would have mentioned it she mentioned the death of two of our old friends oh what changes must have taken place since we left there i wish now we could hear from aunt mary i cannot imagine why we have not received a letter from her this one of lois came by mail i shall be able to send an answer to it by mr gordon lois says they have heard so many tales about us one was that we had gone to south america another that we had gone to texas and still another that we had gotten as far as red river and could not get across in all these we can see some mirror or some perversion of our plans at some time the weather is still very warm this morning it was quite breezy and pleasant we had a heavy rain monday night tuesday july 19th i have not had a spare minute to write any in my journal until now and have now only a little time we were delighted saturday morning by the arrival of willie and loring they had had a very fatigueing trip and were glad indeed to get home loring has had enough of flat boating and i am heartily glad of it for these trips away from home make his manners so rough however his health has improved he did not have a chill after he left home and looks so much stronger and better saturday morning georgie was taken with a fever which lasted all that day and night his breath was bad and his tongue foul and i feared very much that he was going to be quite ill i was so anxious that night that i heard every movement he made and was often at his bedside we sent for the doctor who came sunday morning and gave him some medicine he has had no fever since and is now quite well john is not very well suffers from an affection of the bowels slightly i try to be very careful about his diet and he is very good to abstain from what he likes best green corn and melons to add to my cares emmeline was taken sick friday evening and that night gave birth to a fine boy deprived of her services about the house miss mary and i have a great deal to do i never before realized half the care of housekeeping nor half the trial it is to the patience i have not borne it very well have several times been very much fretted our house is so large and there is so much sweeping and dusting to do about it and then we have none of us ever acquired the habit of saving work it has not been quite a week since mother left but it seems to me like months since emmeline is sick i have to wash and dress george and john every evening the little fellows are gone out this evening to get a book mrs leighton promised to lend me i have hardly time to read it now the children sometimes irritate me but i always feel so sorry for having given way to any tempers and cannot bear them out of my sight we were pleasantly surprised sunday by the arrival of julia barr and miss shawlie creath miss shawlie left that afternoon but julia remained with us i was very glad to have her we were so lonesome and it seems so pleasant and homelike to have her with us i was sorry to see her leave this evening she went for a short visit over on the bayou with mrs dortch will only stay a few days mrs dortch and mrs leighton were here this morning i think i shall like mrs leighton very much i have heard her called stiff but to me there is nothing at all stiff or unsocial about her yonder come the children i must go and meet them wednesday july 27th mother returned yesterday we were almost wild with joy at seeing her again but neither she nor eva are improved as we had hoped to see them eva had two chills while she was gone i am in hopes that coming home may cure her as going away would not mother returned with a very bad nervous headache probably arising from fatigue it is not well today but is better i received a letter from mrs barr which gratified me much and which brought tears to my eyes also a long and affectionate letter from mrs morancy and an equally long one from mattie newcomb full of sentimental expressions juila barr spent monday night with me went over to mrs dortch's yesterday evening we were agreeably surprised by miss kate stone's return last night she has not yet heard from her mother came out with mrs templeton the lady whom she was visiting who brought her daughters out for dr temple to operate on their teeth kate is going back with them to meet jimmy who has now joined harrison's command and gone in to the river on a raid willie returned home monday morning was of course very much tired but was obliged to leave yesterday just after dinner to be gone a month to haul corn down to columbia oh i would be so glad if he could get out of this quarter master's department but there seems to be no prospect of that but why cannot i patiently wait upon the working of that providence which has never aught but blessed me george and loring had such a narrow escape last friday evening they had driven down to mrs lidwell's for some apples leaving me at mrs dortch's and as they were starting back nelly the mule started off at a rapid pace which frightened lory he checked her and then got out of the buggy to lead her along but on reaching her head she became alarmed and galloped off and george commenced to scream loudly loring held on to the bridle for some little distance but finally let go and the mule dashed right on over all that rough road and came round the corner we heard georgie's screams and i at once thought of him and loring we all ran towards the fence and saw the mule galloping rapidly on with poor little georgie alone in the buggy not knowing what was become of lory i was dreadfully frightened but was soon relieved alick dortch caught the mule by jumping out in front of him the worst effect of the affair was that in running rapidly with johnny dortch in her arms miss laura barnes had tripped and fallen spraining her arm badly there was no one else hurt except that the next day poor lory was very much tired from running so fast and from excitement and was confined to his couch almost all day the weather has been very cool for several days the mornings are absolutely unpleasantly chilly but this evening i feel almost suffocating though it is only the stillness of the atmosphere that is oppressive it is quite dry and we are needing rain very much we had a promise of it today but it passed off with only a shadow of a sprinkle i am quite engrossed with doctoring mollie now she has the big head i have found out and mr wynne has given us a recipe for curing her take of old rancid very rancid bacon enough fat to make a pint and a half of grease try it out and then put in a bunch of wormwood as large as you can clasp one hand around by holding it tightly simmer over a slow fire until the wormwood is completely exhausted of it's virtue then squeeze the remainder out and stir salt in the liquid until it is quite thick this nauseous compound is to applied freely to the swelling on both sides of the head and then ironed in with a blanket or other woolen cloth laid over the parts i have performed this operation two mornings now it is to be done nine mornings in succession when she will be cured my beautiful pet is completely disabled it is quite painful to ride her mr gordon came out here last wednesday evening to see father the rob roy the yankee boat has come up again but could not come to monroe on account of the low water mr gordon wanted to go down there and father and he went down together on thursday we had a very early breakfast and they left here a little after six it was a very busy day to me as i had the pantry hall and parlour thoroughly scrubbed and washed that morning we deferred supper till late mr zuber's boy came in to get some water and as his master was camping up at the gate i sent out for him to come in and take supper and spend the night with us he came to supper but left about eleven o'clock saying that he must go to look after his wagons miss mary was very sleepy and lay down on the outside of the bed but i sat up reading des confidences by lamartine and afterwards my bible until nearly one o'clock when i thought it was useless to wait longer and went to bed not without some anxious thoughts about father the first thing i did on waking was to go and look in his bed and felt a pang of disappointment on seeing it spread as usual he came about two o'clock friday fatigued to death having ridden thirty two miles that morning he had found the boat much further down the river than he had anticipated and had deliberated a long time about going on had thought of coming back to let us know and then going all the way back again but mr gordon had been unwilling for him to take all that ride he had concluded finally to go on i am sure i would have been very sorry had he taken all that ride back just on our account father did not go aboard of the boat at all captain griffin had come on shore to see him but would not say certainly whether or not he had anything for him father said he could probably have gotten the things by hanging about the boat but that he would not bend himself one iota for all that its lading which i am glad and proud to know julia barr says mr ludeling brought up a great many things for himself and his immediate friends and she says she heard that captain griffin told some friends that he had mother's things and she should get then before he left i cannot write any more now am going dam to mrs dortch's to see julia and then to mrs temple's with kate to call on mrs templeton and daughters and invite them here and then kate and i are going to mrs scarborough's to sit up with her two little boys who are dreadfully ill with the diptheria and who are at the point of death we were there this morning it is a heart rending sight the poor little sufferers and the anguish of their fond parents who have but three children one a little baby girl only three months old when i came home to dinner i thought of the contrast in the two families so near each other i looked with trembling thankfullness on my two little brothers just about the same age and remembered that mrs scarborough's children were strong and well like these only last week saturday july 30th john has been quite sick we were very anxious about his yesterday he was taken thursday night and early the next morning we sent for the doctor he pronounced his attack bronchitis he had a high fever yesterday but today is better and is playing about though very taciturn and languid he is very hoarse and has a bad cold but has improved so much since morning that i hope by tomorrow he will be quite well george also has a bad cold both of mrs scarborough's children died wednesday night the youngest one in the afternoon kate stone and i were there when the oldest one died oh it was dreadful to think of those poor parents with one little figure lying cold and shrouded and the other insensible breathing his last his dying was long and painful the father's grief was terrible the mother had left the bedside unable to view her darling's suffering and when his father in an agony of grief tore himself from his almost lifeless boy we could hear their groans and sobs as they mounted together in the adjacent chamber as i saw the fearful change come over the face it seemed to me i could live and see it on one of my own dear ones oh god it is terrible and then to see the lifeless body to think where has the spirit gone there it was certain this little suffering soul is now an angel in heaven but we cannot be thus sure of those who have lived to manhood's years my darling brothers rather would i now see you on the bier than to think that in future years you may die without the grace of god and leave earth in uncertainty of gaining heaven mr scarborough and all his family left the next day carrying with them the corpses of the little ones for whose health they had come here so lately in strength and rejoicing mrs scarborough has her little baby to draw the bitterness out of her mother's breast but the poor father has lost his darling both his darlings in one night for him there are none of the softening cares of maternity to lessen his grist how near death and sorrow can come to us and find us still full of our own petty life on thursday kate stone and julia barr were both here and mrs templeton and her daughters returned in the afternoon one would never have thought that two coffins had left our house that morning mrs templeton her daughters and kate left yesterday morning and julia barr also went to mrs dortch's leaving us alone again we were all too much engrossed about john yesterday to think of anything else today i have spent a good deal of time reading lamartine am very much pleased with des confidences but i do not think it so beautiful as his voyage en orient jocelyn must have been a transcript of his own soul i find so many tones like it in these memoirs i knew when i read it that the authour had lived through such feelings as he describes else they could never speak to the heart as they do i don't think i ever read anything which made a more enduring impression on my heart or which became as much a part of my thoughts of my soul as this jocelyn often i surprise myself in thinking that he actually lived and sometimes his longings his words come to me like they were my own indeed what young what imaginative soul ever lived without such thoughts such longings as his just now i came to my window to watch the rising of the storm which the clouds seemed to promise us but now it has all passed by i still hear the sound of distant thunder but am afraid we shall not have the much needed rain for three days it has been very warm and sultry today the heat isoverpowering and i have felt it greatly but now a fresh breeze ruffles the trees tops and comes gratefully to my tired frame
friday august 2nd 1861 mother and father went to monroe yesterday to spend the day father did not return but goes to vicksburg this morning mr boulineau one of the officers on the southern railroad wants father to go over the road and give him some advice now that mr green has given up the charge mr b will fill his place assisted by father's advice and occasional superintendence mother attended the meeting of the monroe aid society yesterday she says that they had no work but did a good deal of talking and writing mother says i must be more particular about my minutes i did not think it necessary to put down anything about our last meeting but i shall do so now just after dinner yesterday an old lady and her son came to see us miss mary and i were sitting in this front room when they came and we could not imagine who they were willie soon came in and addressed the lady as mrs brantley she is one from whom willie hired seven negroes when he went to work she is a very nice old lady she spent all the evening here and also remained during the night miss mary has been busy making a curtain to hang up in our room in case mr robt green should come to stay all night we expected him a little last night and had the curtain all ready he did not come but we had use for the curtain there was a mistake about the beds mrs brantley getting into ours and miss mary and i had to sleep on the floor we only had one moss mattress and our bed was as hard as a board i could not sleep for a long time and this morning my neck and shoulders were very lame mrs brantley has fifteen children she has three sons two sons inlaw and one grandson in our army she came down to try to get a little money from father she said one of her sons had returned home on account of sickness and was now going back again and she wanted to give him some money and send some to his brothers she said that if she could only get a hundred dollars that she would be satisfied we were very sorry that father was not at home if he had been he would have strained every nerve to have paid her under such circumstances but we had no money in the house and father was not here father does not draw any salary now the road is so pressed for money and he is very much straitened mrs brantley says that around in her neighborhood every one has given almost their last cent of ready money to the war cause i called on miss julia wilson monday evening found her at home she was very pleasant her mother calls her wild and some others have said the same but she appeared only animated and pleasing her demeanor was lady like and correct mr hodge adams and family left on tuesday mother went down to bid them goodbye this is such a warm day the thermometer stands at 96 in the shade it has been warm all day but the heat is more intense now at one o'clock i have taken off my dress and am sitting with a thin apron over my shoulders i did not till so late last night and rose so early this morning that i feel quite badly i have done nothing today except to write this journal and wipe off the perspiration the sun beams down intensely hot and scarce a leaf is stirring mother miss mary and i went over to mrs marks this morning and spent an hour or two mrs marks is quilting a silk quilt she showed it to us it is very pretty indeed it reminded me of miss valeria when we were down there she showed us a quilt which she had begun hers was made in little circles each circle being composed of pieces which some friend had given her in the centre was a white piece with the donor's name written on it mrs marks looked very well today she bears her husbands absence with fortitude maintaining sober cheerfulness all the time in mrs marks manners i think she resembles miss valeria somewhat they are both quiet and self possessed but converse easily and intelligently mrs marks is not so intellectual as miss valeria nor is she quite so pleasant in conversation that is to me as is miss valeria father made a windless to our well saturday and we drink that water now it is not so clear or so pleasant to the taste as dr young's well water but tastes very well mr axley to sick has not worked any this week father has had all the sills hauled for our house and mr axley had just finished the outbuildings and was going to work on the house when he was taken sick the summer is slipping away fast now there are only two months more untill cold weather commences and i am very much afraid the house will not be finished far enough for us to move into it in the winter it seems almost impossible for us to live here in cold weather willie has not had another chill but is very weak he is very low spirited too he wants to go to the war and does not feel able to go father is very anxious that he should go at all hazards rose had a dumb chill tuesday and another yesterday she is up today but looks badly mother has given her medicine wednesday august 7th i did not intend to put off writing so long but have almost unconsciously deferred it from day to day father returned home very unexpectedly to us all friday night mother sent uncle jim to monroe that night to get some butter and when he came back he brought word that pa would be home on the stage pa said that he was not wanted in vicksburg and so he came home sunday night lieutenant hervey came out to the gate about two o'clock and called for his buggy father answered him that the owner of the buggy had come and taken it the lieutenant then said that he had gotten off the stage and was now in the open road with a lady father told him that we could not take him in that our shanty was filled to overflowing but that he could probably get a shelter over at dr young's the man went away and according to his version when he had gotten down opposite our house the lady fell down in a faint he built a fire and as the night was dry concluded to wait there until morning mother got up to attend to rosa who was sick in the room and seeing the bright light she imagined that it was lieutenant hervey and thinking that dr young might have refused him admittance she felt sorry for the lady and sent down to the fence to say to them that if they would come up she would give them all that she could in the shape of lodging the servant returned and said that they were not there lieutenant hervey says that the servant did not go to the fire at all in the morning father was going into monroe with the carriage to bring mr green out and mother sent over to invite the lieutenant and the lady to go in with him soon after breakfast the lieutenant came over he said that he had had great trouble about getting together his recruits and was very much fatigued he said that the lady was going on to richmond with him that she was his cousin and in very delicate health having just recovered from a severe illness he promised to send mother the richmond papers when he had arrived and left with many thanks for mother's kindness before i dismiss this subject i must say though not in regular order that mr robt green says that lieutenant hervey has never been to richmond that he has passed over the road several times from camp moore but never from richmond and that the last time he passed he had a lieutenant's commission monday afternoon mrs noble mrs marks mrs wilson and miss scarborough mrs wilson's niece all came to see us miss wilson was too sick to come out monday night about half past ten or eleven o'clock father and mr green came i had been feeling badly all day and went to bed very early knowing that if i did not i should not be able to sit up on the morrow tuesday mr green spent the day with us it was very pleasant and i enjoyed his company an much as any one could who was only half able to sit up mr green is really an admirable man and one whom it would be a pleasure and a privilege to know intimately there appears to be but one defective point in his character the want of earnest religion this alas is a want which too many of us have to deplore neither strictly moral life or a poetical conception of deity can supply the deficiency mr green expects to leave for virginia tomorrow he may be dissappointed but will almost certainly leave next week he says that he does not go from a desire to appear courageous and to be shot at that he may win honourable scars but because he feels deeply that it is his duty to go and he will not fail in this duty his company are now called vicksburg confederates we had a delightful rain yesterday afternoon it commenced at three o'clock and rained on steadily until nearly sunset i was so glad and yet i partly regretted that it rained so long because father and mr green had to go to monroe in the rain father went on to vicksburg too we expect him to return tomorrow night rose is very sick mother sent for the doctor dr white monday evening he pronounced her sickness inflammation of the bowels has been attending on her ever since she is no better but her case is not one of the worst this has been a delightful morning everything looks so green and fresh and the air is deliciously pure and cool mr pierce spent the day with us sunday he is looking very well thursday august 8th this is our society day of course i was present miss mary joined mother did not go she could not leave rose and as she had been sitting up to give medicine until twelve o'clock for several nights she was very much fatigued i was very pleasantly surprised to see mrs young of trenton my acquaintance of the cars at the meetings she met me very cordially she expected to remain in virginia all summer but when the militia was all called out her husband thought it dangerous for her to remain and she returned with mr oliver not however until her husband promised her to come home the last of this month but after she had come back she received a letter from him saying that he could not come home for there was so much sickness among the soldiers that he was needed there they say that dr young loved another young lady but she jilted him and he then married his wife out of pique it is also said that he neglects i am very sorry if this is true mrs young seems devotedly attached to her husband speaks of him with great fondness she is a very pleasant lady is boarding at mr oliver's this summer said that i had been so kind to her in going to vicksburg and during her brief stay there that she wished to continue our acquaintance and would come to see me soon i hope she will she joined the society today we have no work as yet will probably have some at the next meeting mrs gainey gave us ten dollars today and also brought four pair of socks mrs friend sent twelve pair of socks mother received a letter last night from miss stewart she showed me the back of it this morning and asked me if i could guess who it was from i could not and she told me i was never more perfectly surprised i had given up all idea of hearing from her again she says in her letter that she answered mother's letter saying that if we could make her only tolerably comfortable she would accept or the situation but she directed her letter lynhurst and consequently we never received it she is now teaching in vicksburg but her engagement will expire in september and she is then willing to come to us that is if we have not filled the place mother is going to open negotiations immediately oh i do hope that she will prove to be a superior teacher and that we will be able to engage her i must learn something soon i am fast approaching young lady hood and i am very ignorant father has just come we have been sitting up for him i must now retire friday aug 9th mrs c g young and carrie came over yesterday evening mrs nobles and her daughter anna also came in mrs nobles says that miss julia wilson has been quite sick with the fever since the rain we have had very cool evenings and mornings but at noonday it is quite warm while i write 2 o'clock the thermometer is a 97 this morning when i went to ride this morning it was delightful the fresh cool air swept through the woods with that swift rustle which always reminds me of autumn saturday aug 10th i have just found the following beautiful poem in the monroe intelligencer as the paper is dr young's and i cannot cut it out i copy it here rock me to sleep backward turn backward oh time in your flight make me a child again just for tonight mother come back from the echoeless shore take me again to your heart as of yore kiss from my forehead the furrow of care smooth the few silver threads out of my hairs over my slumbers your loving watch keep rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep backward flow backward o swift tide of years i am weary of toil i am weary of tears toil without recompense tears all in vain take them and give me my childhood again i have grown weary of dust and decay weary of throwing my soul wealth away weary of sowing for others to reap rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep over my heart in the days that are flown no love like mother love ever was thrown no other worship abides and endures faithful unselfish and patient like yours none like a mother can charm away pain from the sorrowing soul and world weary brain slumber's soft calm o'er my heavey lids creep rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep tired of the hollow the base the untrue mother o mother my heart calls for you many a summer the grass has grown green blossomed and faded our faces between yet with strong yearning and passionate pain long i tonight for your presence again come from the silence so long and so deep rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep come let your brown hair just lighted with gold fall on my shoulders again as of old let it fall o'er my forehead tonight shielding my eyes from the flickering light for oh i with it's sunny edged shadows once more happily will throng the sweet visions of yore lovingly softly it's bright billows sweep rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep mother dear mother the years have been long since last i was hushed by your lullaby song sing then again to my soul it shall seem womanhood's years have been only a dream clasped to by your arms in a loving embrace with your soft light lashes just swooping my face never hereafter to wake or to weep rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep sunday august 11th 61 we could not go to sunday school this morning it rained from daylight to nine or ten o'clock it was quite a dissappointment but i have been able to pass the morning as profitably as i would have done at school miss mary had another chill this morning she was perfectly discouraged had not any control over her feelings but exclaimed that she should die if she remained here during the summer she had a slight dumb chill day before yesterday and was imprudent in leaving her bed this morning she has almost recovered from the effects of the chill now and is talking and laughing in the other room though she is still in bed rose is much better has sat up for some time today sylvia had a child born yesterday a boy it is quite warm today in spite of the rain i do not think it can have cleared off yet i think i am passing i might say have passed through an ordeal lately the ordeal of selfdenial in the greatest of luxuries to me this is occasional privacy and quiet i used to think when we first came here that it would be almost impossible for me to live as we have lived in constant society with one another and almost constant noise i hope i do not speak presumptuously or irreverrently when i say that strength has been given me from above to bear this trial unusual mental peace and thankfulness and faith have blessed my endeavours after patience and i now rarely or never feel inclined to murmur it has been a great blessing to me in teaching me self control in little things self control in great things i learned before but have never been sufficiently watchful over the little foxes yet let me not exult before the day of trial is passed let me bear in mind the apostolic injunction be not highminded but fear to be constantly fearful of sin is the only way to guard against it friday aug 16th 1861 the days have passed in their usual routine all the week father left us for vicksburg monday but returned wednesday night miss mary has had two chills this week one tuesday and one yesterday she is very weak today looked almost as badly as she did after her first attack we have had very cool weather this week yesterday was a delightful day father and i went to monroe yesterday miss puss and miss hannah bry went with us we went in to attend the meeting of the monroe society we went to mrs roane's and asked her to accompany us and then repaired to the meeting where we remained until one o'clock we then returned to mrs roane's and spent the rest of the day there we did not come home until after the cars arrived so that we had a moonlight ride the day was very pleasant indeed mr robt green and his company leave for virginia today the employees of the southern road presented mr green with a very handsome sword before he left father is at home today he is having the sills of the house placed the house will occupy much more room than i at first thought it takes up almost the whole of our little hill wednesday august 21st 61 so quietly do the days pass that the record of one may almost suffice for that of another father left for vicksburg monday we expect him back tonight we have all been picking lint this week and have filled two good sized boxes miss mary and i went over to mrs parks monday evening learned how to card it is very hard work and my hands are nearly blistered and my arm quite lame mrs marks spent the day with us yesterday and we all worked together miss mary and i tied up our heads but mrs marks did not and her hair is full of lint it flies about so all over the floor and our dresses misses puss and hannah bry were up to see us monday evening they are very pleasant indeed the weather has been rainy or cloudy all the week yesterday it was quite warm we have heard of victories won by our soldiers in western virginia missouri and texas it is reported and believed that at leesburg three hundred federalists were killed and the rest one thousand five hundred taken prisoners in missouri gen'l lyon is killed and siegel reported wounded i hope all these good reports are true it is almost incredible that at leesburg only six of our men were killed and nine wounded i forgot to mention that father called upon miss stewart while in vicksburg she is forty or fifty years old rubs snuff and pets a lap dog the first is no objection but the last two are besides this she never stays in one place longer than six months this last would deter us from engageing her as we wish a permanent teacher mr barron has reccommeded another miss stuart to father i am to write to her this evening but do not feel much confidence in the reccommendation wednesday august 28th 61 willie miss mary and rose have all been sick since sunday willie was taken with a chill sunday but has not had any since he is walking about today but looks badly miss mary has been very sick she too had a chill sunday and another monday she is very very weak and her face hands and whole body are painfully thin mother sent for dr whyte yesterday morning he prescribed the invariable calomel and quinine she is somewhat better this morning but is utterly prostrated she will never get well until she has a change of air and scene i think this attack was brought on by exposure friday afternoon she went out to ride on horseback with three or four girls and boys it was very damp but the girls came for her and she wanted to go so much that mother could not refuse her it was the first ride she had taken this year and she went four or five miles then she came home she had a boisterous dance until dark then again saturday evening we took tea at mrs noble's with a party of girls and boys and after playing in the yard for some time came home after dark it was not raining but was cloudy and the damp air together with such an unusual amount of violent exercise was too much for miss mary in her weak state rose has had an attack of common chills she has missed the chills today and will probably be up this evening father left for vicksburg monday afternoon we expect him back tonight rain rain i sometimes think it will never stop it rained all last week we had a short respite sunday morning but the rain commenced in the evening and continued steadily all night monday morning it held up for a few hours and we hoped it would clear off but it commenced again and rained all night yesterday was a regular rainy day no cessation and the air was raw and chilly last night a continuous dropping this morning after breakfast we hailed the bright sunshine with delight but a brisk shower quenched our hopes now the sun has come out again and as it seemed to be growing brighter i think it may clear up our house leaks all over in some places the floor is beginning to mildew every thing is damp and the mould is constantly accumulating on books and boxes every night this week i have been awaked by the rain dropping on my pillow and have laid down again with a wash basin at my head to catch the water father took a great deal of trouble to get cypress boards so as to have the roof tight but they were too thin and have all split mother and i sewed for the soldiers yesterday we made three flannel shirts with emmeline's help in the evening mother and i are knitting woolen socks for the soldiers mother has begun her second pair but i have not finished my first one yet it is the second sock i ever knit the three victorys i spoke of have been confirmed we are on the rapid road to success
oakland august 3rd 1862 this is one of the saddest pages in my journal i have not written here for more than a week i have not had the heart grandma is dead she was taken sick just two weeks ago today and died last sunday the 27th we all followed her to the grave on monday she is buried almost in sight of the house on our land oh what a week this has been it seemed as if it would never end i sat up with grandma the last night she was unconscious for two days except at short intervals the last word she said was satira i was leaning over her and i think she took me for aunt satira every thing reminds me of her especially in my room i could scarcely bear to enter it and am just beginning to overcome the feeling a little she died in the hall the hall where she was so fond of sitting we scarcely ever sit there now it seems months since she was here though it is not a week since her body lay cold and quiet in that very hall where we all walked on tiptoe and spoke in whispers as if death could be disturbed my mind has been so weak so very weak and i have felt so sad my body too has been sick and today i feel scarcely able to sit up george is the only well one sunday aug 10th 62 we are all getting better now but many of us are far from well georgie has been complaining for several days i took medicine and lay in bed tuesday and was hardly able to sit up for several days after i feel much better now john is not at all well and is very fretful father left home tuesday to be gone two weeks but returned very unexpectedly last night he went to vicksburg and to jackson he looks much better than when he went mr green has been in two battles lately came out of both uninjured father saw it in the papers i am so glad to hear it but they are constantly skirmishing in virginia and he may not be living now a number of young men from monroe were killed in the late richmond battle we hear of deaths et either from disease or the sword nearly every day mrs phillips and her daughter mrs byrne spent the day here friday mrs phillip's brother was among the slain at richmond these things make me feel sad sometimes my spirits fall dreadfully but i try to battle against the ideas that creep unawares into my mind and i endeavour to free myself from the melancholy that takes hold upon me mother and i called upon mrs filhiol yesterday she is a very pleasant lady she reminds me so much of aunt lydia her manners are so like aunt lydia's pleasant and easy mr filhiol too is a very agreeable gentleman reminds me irresistably of mr green every motion every tone is so much like his miss scarborough came over to mrs wilson's last week she and miss julia were here friday the weather is warm yet and dry but not very dry i received letters from lois and aunt mary a week or two ago grandma holton is at uncle david's she has been very sick but the country air was improving her lois is at mr holgandorf's still says she is in excellent health wednesday aug 20th the yankees have come back a few days ago they came down the river took a cargo of arms which was lying at the landing marched over to tallulah burned the railroad warehouse and some cars and then marched back to their gunboats again we had a guard of several hundred men at the river but they had no head to direct them and ran like sheep some soldiers have now gone down to the swamp father intended to go to mobile this week but of course he cannot go now i am sorry for i think a journey would do him good he went into monroe monday heard the news was busy preparing a train to transport the soldiers until eight or nine o'clock reached tallulah at twelve was busy there for some time and did not reach monroe again until daybreak he was busy there all day yesterday returned home about dark and went to bed without any supper he is thin weak and lowspirited oh what would i give to see him well again a soldier came here to breakfast this morning after he had finished and was sitting at the table mother told him not to wait if he was in a hurry no he said i am going to take my time going back i had to run all the way down to monroe yesterday general blanchard sent out an indefinite order to the camps and all the men that were able went off the consequence was there were too many and some had to march back immediately capt sam adams is at home on furlough monday morning mother and i were sitting sewing when we were surprised by his entrance accompanied by a mr golding we had not expected the honor of a visit from him as it was he came to see about buying a negro he is much improved since he went not near so conceited apparently and more polished in his manners there is a familiarity about him however which repels me i may be too romantic in my ideas but i like to see a gentleman's manner towards a lady respectful even to reverence we have a vacation now we have no school since grandma's death i have been busy since i have been well enough to do anything making out a list of british poets and writing down the most important events of their lives this keeps me contented for i believe that i am learning something in doing it i want constant occupation it is now nearly four months since i heard a word from my dear miss valeria though i have written several letters to her sometimes i long to see her with a longing that cannot be described now when i am in my room every where i turn i see something to remind me of my departed grandmother i stay here no more than i can help i have visited her grave only once though i feel i ought to go there the sorrow in my heart seems hard and cold we have had no rain yet willie says if we do not have rain soon all the crops will be ruined the dust in the road is perfectly suffocating mrs richardson and sister were over here monday they are very pleasant ladies i think i like mrs scarborough best sunday aug 31st the last day of the month and also of our vacation tomorrow we commence school again i have not accomplished half the work which i allotted to this vacation alas i could not forsee the future i did not expect the sorrowful event of last month which has rendered our vacation a month of mourning instead of joy and of sickness and lassitude instead of health and hard work the only useful things i have done are the commencement of my poetical list and the making of some soldiers shirts i received a letter from miss ginnie calwell last night it brought sad news to me the ridgills have left amite that was in june three months ago and i have not heard from miss valeria yet i don't know what can have happened if i could only hear from her she is one of my few loved they are few whom i love but oh how my heart clings to them i ought to feel thankful this evening and i indeed i do feel so though i cannot but be a little sad we have had quite a little shower this evening hardly enough to lay the dust but there is prospect of more it has been so dry everything is burning up even this little shower refreshes us though it has now nearly all dried into the parched earth father returned from jackson miss last night he crossed the river at vicksburg no gunboats were in sight then though two have come down since very few of the people had moved back to vicksburg but those have remained there father came from jackson to vicksburg with dr lord and bishop green the bishop had not received a letter from his nephew neither had any one else that father saw though mr smedes had heard of him through his son who is a lieutenant in capt green's company he says that capt green behaved with great gallantry their regiment was in that desperate charge in which so many brave men were fruitlessly sacrificed they were commanded to lie down to shield themselves from the deadly fire and kept that position an hour when finally they were allowed to retire capt green found himself alone with two of his lieutenants and four men the rest were killed wounded and missing of course many came back again after the fight was over puss bry spent the day with us yesterday capt sam adams has been very sick is better now mr dillard has also been very low his situation is now precarious all our family are quite well now we have commenced reading aloud again last we begun anne of guirstein we enjoy it very much willie is exceedingly interested in it we shall have little time for reading when school commences again
aug 1st 63 father left for marshall this morning went in a sort of jersey belonging to the railroad and took uncle jim to drive him we miss father so much and he will be gone two weeks had a pleasant rain today and this evening tabitha scarborough willie and i had a delightful ride went up on the hill near mrs compton's the scene from there was beautiful very beautiful and tranquil in the light of the setting sun august thursday 6th i am alone this evening all have gone down to mrs barr's except eva and john and they are in the garden i feel very nervous this evening as if something were about to happen or perhaps it is what has happened that is influencing me last night i had a vision i can call it nothing else at least it was a dream beautiful and as vivid as reality it was about eight o'clock in the evening and we were up stairs in the hall miss mary and i at the east windows mother at the west suddenly mother called us and we hurried to the window i gazed in a thrill of awe and wonder at the sight before me a few degrees above the belt of trees there shone a star the size and brilliancy of jupiter but not him because he was lower at that time this beautiful star gradually yet quickly grew as large and round as the full moon sparkling all over its surface at brilliant points like diamonds while below it many other stars of the same shape and brilliancy but smaller formed out of space and took before my astonished eyes the shape of the word nebraska standing out clear and distinct against the dark blue the letters perfectly formed as in print i have never seen such a beautiful sight such a wonderful heavenly vision i gazed in rapture and in terrour it seemed to me i was beholding unfolded before me the destiny of my country as i thus gazed the lower stars faded and were lost in the blue the upper star grew fainter and fainter and at last looked as if shrouded in mist but soon it grew again brilliant oh so brilliant and as before mysteriously with a quickness astonishing and yet gradual the word massachusetts was formed the spell of awe and wonder was broken by grief and disappointment as i saw this odious word shining in dazzling brilliancy before me i sank my head in my hands and groaned and wept in agony and humiliation it was a terrible agony but soon a hand was laid upon my shoulder i sprang up as the word look fell upon my ear and there before me i saw still the brilliant stars but underneath the word epouvantee intimidated by its glitter seemed to throw the light of the charnel of the hated massachusetts i uttered a cry of joy of relief i felt a load lifted from my heart perfect peace was there instead of bitterness oh the joy of that moment new forms the stars took familiar names but the feeling of this agony and joy has obliterated the others in my mind but at last the stars sunk and faded none remained but the upper one which took again its familiar form but now a new and wondrous sight prepared itself in the east arose a sun whose beams of crimson and gold and amber light shot high up the firmament it was most glorious and only died away to make room for another smaller but not fainter i drew in my breath for awe and delight but at last these marvellous visions past away it was near dawn the whole yard was crowded with negroes gazing awestruck but they began to disperse a well known form drove up it was that of mr kern my grandmother's pastor in savannah who has been since three years in the silent land without speaking i put my arm in his and walking into the house for i had descended from the hall i spoke to him of the marvellous sight which he also had witnessed i was still talking to him when rose came to wake me only half aroused i said rose did you see the stars last night she said no ma'am was it a dream i thought no she could not have seen them and yet it is strange i said i cannot get up yet i have been up all night i know not what she thought of my strange words when i rose i walked to my shelf took down my french dictionary and there found epouvantee to assure myself that it was a word and that i had not mistaken the signification it is strange for the word is very unfamiliar to me and yet i was perfectly correct can it be that this is a vision and this french word it seems to mean something we hear that france has recognized the confederacy and has a fleet in the mississippi but i must not trust to these rumours and to confirm a dream yet this vision gives me new confidence it seems to me that god has revealed to me that we will prevail through his mercy helping us oh that this might be it was so real to me even now i can see the glorious dazzling vision of stars and suns it has been prevent to me all day thursday aug 13th 63 since i wrote last i have been very busy and have a great deal to write now though only a week has passed tuesday miss mary and i had been down to mrs barr's mother had a headache and we returned a little after sunset what was our surprise on entering her room to find father sitting there it was indeed a joyful surprise for we had not expected him before friday at the earliest he says he had quite an agreeable journey he looks improved i have been feeling very badly for the past week for three days especially i have scarcely been able to sit up i have a boil which pains me exceedingly and have been half lying down all day last night i had quite a nervous fever but to my record mrs mays came up and spent the day with us saturday in the evening willie and i and eva took a delightful ride down to mrs barr's tabitha scarborough was to have gone with us but julia willson came over and was hastily preparing to go to kentucky to stay with her sister we rode down there to tell her goodbye but i have since heard that she was not able to go when we got down to mrs barr's we found mrs morancy sick with the diptheria i was very sorry indeed it rained while we were there and we were obliged to accept mrs barr's kindness and come home in her carriage mrs barr lent me following of christ by thomas á kempis i never have read such a book it is like rain upon a parched and thirsty soil i never shall cease to thank her for its loan the pleasure it has given me the good it has done me i cannot estimate i could read it always as yet i am not half through i have so much to do i do not get much time i spend a half hour every morning in reading it another with my bible and in prayer and meditation before the stillness of the morning has gone and while i can watch the early sunbeams glancing on the tree tops and among the foliage before my window it is the most blessed hour of the day to me monday mrs phillips spent the day with us there is a repellent influence between us that i cannot overcome i had almost forgotten to say that sunday a soldier came here to get board for a day or two he had been sick and was still very weak mother took him though not as a boarder it is a thing we have never taken yet and a soldier has never yet paid us for anything this man's name is lieut hargrove though at first we thought him a private he is a very good plain man went into monroe tuesday to see the doctor came back yesterday with a furlough and is going home this evening he is improved very much in strength tuesday night we had a heavy rain the thunder and lightning were sublime yesterday i spent the day at mrs barr's went down in the buggy with father who was on his way to monroe had a delightful ride in the cool refreshing morning everything looked bright after the rain i spent a very pleasant day though suffering very much from my boil and weakness miss mary and lory rode down in the afternoon and came home when father and i did i have another hat on hand one for mrs wynne's little boy she asked me at church one day if i would make one for him and she would pay me any price i asked i told her if she would send me the palmetto i would him a present of the making i commenced it monday and am trying to finish it this week though i have felt so ill that it is something of an effort i have my hands full of work now so many books to read i finished the mill on the floss last week returned it and tabitha sent me bayard taylor's europe seen with knapsack and staff and dr antonio the first we are reading aloud the second i have not yet commenced besides these i have lamartine's works and two little stories jacques cour and edouard de tremont from mrs mcguire i have not commenced the two latter but have been revelling in the voyage in orient which i have half finished i think it is beautiful i am going to love lamartine and to wish ardently that i had known him his thoughts are so elevated so pure and there is a sentiment of such deep religion in everything he says such deep pure sentiment as i had thought very few of the french poet philosophers ever felt there is nothing more ennobling to men than this i love poetry and there is none more beautiful than the prose poetry of lamartine in which he interprets the holy land it is true i could prefer it english to me there is something far more noble in our stately english tongue than in the lighter more profuse french oh shall i ever see these lands i know not and yet something seems to tell me i shall yet stand under the solemn pine grove of beirut on the holy lebanon's peaks or more holy more touching yet i shall look upon jerusalem the holy city oh if i could but have the blessed privilege of treading with reverent feet the ground of gethsemane of weeping upon the saviour's tomb i cannot read lamartine's touching burst of feeling at the holy sepulchre without tears i feel with him so entirely i have not time to write more though on this theme i should never tire but i must go to work i must not forget that with me passion too often mingles with zeal this thought is from thomas a kempis i have often felt it never been able to express it i found mrs morancy much better yesterday jenny was not well thursday aug 20th just a week since my last entry a week spent for the greater part in visiting i consider this a duty as well as everything else and a duty very difficult to perform well at least i am too apt either to neglect it altogether or else to neglect other things in consequence of it today i have felt disinclined for any of my customary employments partly from indolence principally from an ill weary feeling that oppresses me very much of late friday afternoon mother father and i went into monroe mother and i to pay some visits just as i was putting on my hat the two miss grahams and miss hannah bly drove up they readily excused we did not feel as if we could relinquish our visit when we were all ready and the carriage at the door we went to mrs calderwood's found no one at home but miss laura barnes who was on a visit there and had a very pleasant hour or two with her and some delicious pears and apples we also went to see mrs jo mcguire the first time i had ever met her a very pleasant lady but small and very plain had a delightful drive home with the rich sunset before us i never can drive westward without thinking of our future which seems bound to this western land saturday we went up to mrs compton's saw the young ladies and miss stacy it seemed pleasant and familiar to me to be there and yet that parlour brought up a quick sharp pang which i so often feel i thought of one lost forever i regretted while we sat in silence waiting for the young ladies i truly regretted our pleasant familiar intercourse of last winter now so suspended if not entirely broken i don't think i have been in fault though perhaps i have unconsciously given offence john davis came out saturday to make arrangements for a journey to miss he said on his last journey he passed within a quarter of a mile of where mr ridgill used to live he heard they had moved i suppose it is true for miss valeria told me in her last letter that they would go if vicksburg fell oh unhappy vicksburg once our pride now i had just written a long letter a few days before but could not resist writing again to tell valeria to direct my letters care of mr boulineau while writing i thought of a plan less foolish than that of directing to hazelhurst it was to enclose my letter under cover to miss harrison summerfield ala a friend of whom i have often heard valeria speak thinking perhaps she might know where they lived i do long for a letter in that beloved handwriting once more oh how i am blessed in this dear friend though parted from her i think of her as one not absent john davis took a chill here saturday and remained till monday morning he will not leave till next week monday i finished little willie wynne's hat and carried it home in the evening mother and i went in the buggy and miss mary and loring accompanied us on horseback i felt recompensed for my weariness in making the hat by the pleasure it gave the little family mrs wynne asked me what i charged for it i answered in an embarrassed way that she was quite welcome and something more of the sort and she told me that if there was anything i wanted on that place just to send and get it tuesday morning i rode up to mrs barr's found her quite sick poor lady she seems pining gradually away i earnestly hope she may not die though to her worn and tired spirit it would be a relief but it would be terrible to poor mrs morancy tuesday evening miss mary and i went down to mrs lidwell's eva was invited to a doll's wedding at agnes willson's on our way home we called for her and i stopped and spent a few minutes pleasantly with tabitha and mrs scarborough while the carriage went to mrs fithiol's for mother wednesday i spent the day at mrs graham's to make up for leaving the young ladies the other evening i spent a much pleasanter day than i had anticipated there was a miss clark a refugee from the swamp spending a few days there i did not see much of her as she had a chill and fever that day i like miss melissa graham quite well but oh we young ladies are all so surface like so useless i pray god i may be useful only usefull i feel that i can say with evangeline often i have no wish nor desire but to follow meekly with reverent steps the footprints of my redeemer and yet how i fail oh so sadly many are the vain desires that every now and then trouble this prevailing one and my flesh is so weak i am always failing but i must go on this evening i had expected to visit miss creath who returned monday but the afternoon has been so dark and we have had such a cold drizzling rain that i could not go out in my organdie dress my only dress fresh so i put the visit off for more favourable weather though i am disappointed i wanted to finish my visiting this week and have the next quiet and undisturbed carrie young was over here yesterday afternoon miss mat newcomb and her sister spent a few days with carrie last week were coming over here but their sister mrs mcclendon was thrown out of a buggy and seriously injured and they had to shorten their visit we had a beautiful cactus bloom tuesday i sent it over to miss mat but she was gone i must close this journal i have a little time before dark but must devote it to copying some lines mrs morancy lent me a long time ago and which have been waiting in my desk for a little leisure they are in manuscript by mrs warfield authoress of the household of bouverie and a cousin of mrs morancy's mary aged sixteen the beautiful is vanished and returns not schiller again the pall is flung above the fair and young again the mourners of a stricken race come forth to mingle tears o'er blighted hopes of years that death has frozen in that marble face again the bitter cry whose searching agony so often to the throne of god has sped goes up from lips of woe as in time long ago of rachel mourning for her children dead how beautiful how calm palm folded unto palm as in a happy sleep she lies at rest the dark hair braided low across her brow of snow and blossoms heaped upon her virgin breast the features fair and fine fixed in that smile divine which rests like glory on the holy dead shall need but little change to fit them for that strange and lovely land where now her steps must tread even while on earth she stayed by glimpses was portrayed the angel lingering in an earthly guise something too sad and deep for girlhood's joy would sweep across her musing brow sad earnest eyes the world was not her sphere the chain that held her here was severed suddenly by love supreme thus we who darkly trust with sorrowing brows in dust must for the comfort of our anguish deem if solemn hope and prayer if constancy and care had aught availed against the hand of fate that beauteous form of clay might still have known the day and walked before us in it's strength elate but he whose perfect ways our dim unsteady gaze darkly as in a glass beholds with awe hath called his angel back from earth's untrodden track to know the mystery of the living law from the fever and the strife the weary march of life from the contagion of the world's slow stain from the quick and wild unrest joy waking in the breast and from the wearing hand of age and pain our father has removed the being that we loved oh sorrowing parents to her home sublime to know a rest secure a joy forever pure a life untroubled by the change of time if from your earthly bower you miss one lovely flower behold another star has lit the sky if by your mortal hearth you miss one shape of earth another angel joins the host on high beechmoor july 21 mrs elisha warfield oakland aug 25th 1863 about three quarters of an hour ago willie miss mary and i were sitting in our room i reading the others playing checkers eva was in bed with a slight fever father had retired and mother was about to do so at once i heard a man's step on the hall threshhold then a quick walk through the spurs clinking at every step it was john davis come to bring the following note to father col wm m wadley dr sir news just received at headquarters that a force estimated at 7000 have crossed the macon and that the advanced forces are crossing boeuf river at pt jefferson 12 miles from girard and 24 from monroe duvall saw the courier who said our forces were firing on them they are travelling rapidly send in for the office things i cannot leave jos f mcguire the first thing we did was to give mr davis some supper father rose and dressed himself to go to monroe willie old mr burke the railroad overseer went out to see about the team poor eva was crying before but felt worse now so quickly was everything done that they are all off now father and mr davis in the buggy mr burke accompaning the wagon on a mule willie remains with us he is to sleep in eva's room tonight and has brought down his gun we have otherwise done nothing except to count up the very little silver we have out willie and miss mary have resumed their interrupted game and are playing while i write we do not expect father home until nearly morning i cannot exactly describe my feelings they are perfectly free from fear i feel a sort of exhiliration a firm and healthy pulsation the result of excitement but not agitation it does not seem possible to me that the yankees should come here and i should see them a sight which i have hoped and prayed i might never witness we took a ride to mrs barr's this evening miss mary and i poor woman how she will feel when she hears this her son and nephew were both absent the latter at alexandria mr barr went to tensas parish with his wife a few days ago i do so pity mrs barr we had a delightful ride home this evening the clear cold and brilliant western sky the bracing air like that of fall the delightful motion of our horses and the green swelling hills on each side contributed to remove the load of sorrow from my heart awhile oh my beloved hills how much longer shall i dwell among you oh my beautiful home must the yankees tread here on this soil that i so love i cannot bear the thought but i do not fear them have i not a father in heaven he knows all that is best for me he will take care of me only whatever happens may i act as a christian and a southern patriot should act wednesday morning aug 26th eva is quite sick this morning her fever lasted all night the doctor has just left did not think it anything serious emmeline has the diptheria but not at all badly i hope she will get over it easily we could not do without her now father returned about twelve o'clock last night said everything was quiet in town and he heard nothing more he went in immediately after breakfast said he would try and be back to dinner we are expecting to hear something when he arrives he left this morning in a rather skeptical mood but the doctor says that the yankees really are coming he saw mr oliver who was coming from town in haste and packing up to leave we cannot go our wagons are none of them ready i say none one may be but that is not enough to move us it is as cold perhaps colder today than yesterday a fire is quite comfortable though we have none it is just like fall weather so unseasonable that i am afraid it will produce a good deal of sickness how strange that i can write upon such trifling subjects when maybe the yankees are so near but i feel perfectly calm just as i always do when i think there is something great to happen or happening to me a stillness firmness and activity which i so often so generally lack thursday aug 27th i do not know where or how to begin all is movement anxiety expectation we are doubly troubled eva is very ill i am writing in her room by the candle light her fever has never yet left her yesterday evening she had an alarming nervous paroxism and another more violent about 11 o'clock at night i sat up with her till 2 then mother took my place this morning and all today she has been quite sensible and has less fever this morning but there has been a good deal of unavoidable noise which perhaps has had some effect in increasing her fever and nervousness tonight she complains of excessive weakness sleeps a great deal but not peacefully takes all the medicine given her and is scarcely irritable at all this is all so different from her usual manner when sick we had a sad parting this evening from mrs barr and her family they have started for texas in company with major waddell's family they stayed with us last night and today until this evening about 5 o'clock it was like parting with a near and dear relation to tell them goodbye poor mrs barr her's has been a sorrowful lot and she is so lovely so ladylike and admirable mrs morancy too her youth blighted i could not but love her miss julia is so useful to her mother she directs everything arranges everything dr young's family left today oh if we were only on our way but it is impossible for us to go now father says if it were not for eva he might attempt to go but as it is we cannot stir willie wants to take away the negroes and stock i don't know whether he will or not poor father he says that for the first time in his life he don't know what to do he was in monroe yesterday all the morning seeing to the railroad things and could not sleep last night from his thoughts prince emmeline's husband came to father last night begging him to buy him father has tried once or twice before but could not prince said a speculator offered his master 5000 dollars for him but he prince told him flatly that he would not go with him he was so anxious for father to buy him said one reason i want to get away from monro is because these black folks that come back say the yankees takes all the young looking fellows and puts them in the army and i've no notion of going in the army father went in this morning and bought him for four thousand dollars i expect he will bring him out tonight father went away immediately after breakfast and returned to dinner he went back soon after and has not come yet though it is eight o'clock we are expecting him momently i feel so tired tonight from my last night's vigil i rose at six this morning and have been standing or walking a great deal during the day i have not slept at all mother is tired and i am afraid fatigue and anxiety will make her sick since mrs barr's family left i feel as if we were alone many of our acquaintances here will leave so would we if we could but it is not our family father feels himself bound to attend to the railroad employees who all look up to him for advice and protection as soon as the railroad is stopped they are all liable to the conscription every one except father he tried to get general smith to release them he said would gladly do it but could not father would have gone to richmond thinking his influence might be sufficient but for this raid or this invasion whatever it is then there are all the railroad papers money and negroes to be taken care of besides the machinery this last the government has taken in hand an officer arrived this evening after the wagons had been unloaded with an order that the machinery should go on immediately willie felt very badly this order coming in father's absence and he did not know what father's wishes would be but there was no help the officer was rude in his peremptoriness and willie ordered the teams to be gotten ready the officer went went away but returned a little while before supper he is still here waiting for father's return willie and he are both taking a nap now for willie expects to be up all night with the wagons mr burke has been up for several nights and is very much fatigued i commenced writing before supper but it is now some time since i rose from the table eva wakes every few minutes and requires my attention father is so late that we think what mr mcguire wrote us this evening is quite true that is that the yankees were within five miles of monroe poor mrs mcguire is not in state to be removed oh how i pity all like her now i hear the gate latch perhaps it is father the clock is just ringing nine in it's clear silvery tones which i love so well friday aug 28th we have just finished dinner and i have resumed my watch by eva's side she is as i was about to add sleeping quietly she waked and i have been attending to her for some time she is now sleeping again she has been free from fever for four or five hours and has slept nearly all that time but complains of great weakness when she wakes of course nothing else could be expected when her fever has not left her before since tuesday night and she has taken little nourishment father did not return till ten last night found the poor officer waiting for him but all to no purpose for father had the wagons which were several miles on their way turned back said he could not allow them to go in that way he confirmed what the doctor said about the near approach of the yankees the road has been full of soldiers and movers all day this morning we had a dozen or more here for breakfast and three for dinner besides two sick ones now lying in the parlour poor fellows i pity them willie has been busy all day loading the wagons and preparing to start with the negroes and stock we are to keep only the house servants alice sally emmeline and prince and their children i suppose uncle jim will stay too and rose i forgot her it seems such a matter of course that she should stay it is cloudy and by turns rainy has been so all day the sun has just come out how rapidly it is sinking what may tomorrow bring we hear that the yankees entered monroe last night our authorities have burned the pontoon bridge over the ouachita willie takes my little pet mollie with him of course i could not keep her here in danger though she would be a great solace to me and i shall miss her exceedingly willie thinks he will leave this evening we are to send our treasures by him oh how i shall hate to see him leave my dear good brother he is so dear to me i hardly know anything that is going on i remain in here alone mother is very busy making necessary garments for some of the women occasionally father and willie or some of the others come in but it disturbs eva very much to hear the least talking and we try to keep as still as possible she has had no nervous paroxisms since wednesday night we are almost the only family left on the road the willson's and richardson's and goodrich's are all gone i am in hopes we may be able to go before many weeks we shall try to do so willie will have pleasant moonlight nights for travelling i am glad of that i must write no more now goodbye old book i suppose i ought not to waste paper in journal writing but it is a great comfort to me and fortunately we have a good deal of paper thanks to father's kind foresight i found an old account book of father's which i shall use after this private journal saturday aug 29th 1863 oakland la about twelve o'clock this morning mr mccormick came out from monroe and told us that the yankees had gone they came into monroe about eleven o'clock yesterday morning and went away about seven this morning taking with them a number of negroes mules and some wagons we had pickets out on the roads leading from monroe within a mile of this place and though anybody was allowed to come out no one could go in except by taking the bushes this was the plan mr mccormick intended to pursue in returning and dr whyte was obliged to do the same we were so glad to hear the welcome news though we suspect that the retiring of the yankees may be only a feint to draw our soldiers back and entrap them but father says he thinks this was only a kind of recconnoissance and that they will steam up the river this fall after making abundant preparations i hope we may not be here then i thought it would be terrible to leave home but while the yankees were so near i longed to go i am so glad i did not see any of them father sent prince for willie today to tell him to leave the negroes with mr burke and come back with the carriage we expect him tonight perhaps he left about dusk last night i never felt as i did when he left every thing seemed quiet it was so this morning and is tonight i felt an aimlessness it seemed as if we were so solitary like a great wall were around us separating us from the world the whole neighbourhood seems deserted father gave all the negroes choice yesterday evening told them they might go with willie to a place of safety or they might bundle up their things and go to the yankees to take a free choice they might have done so in reality father would not have hindered them but they every one chose to go with willie some were not sincere for mr mccormick says that mr duvall is sure he saw one of them he thinks several with the yankees this morning when they left i was passing through the hall yesterday morning and overheard one of the railroad negroes talking to father something was said about going to the yankees no mars william abe said i come from georgia and you did too and i calculate to die by you eva was better this morning but has not slept any today and is worse this evening she complains of great prostration difficulty of breathing and a pain in her side has very little fever the doctor came after dinner prescribed quinine through the evening and night at short intervals he said that if she was not better tomorrow she must have more medicine poor child she has now been sick four days and nights one side is so sore from the applications of plasters that she cannot lie on it i have been with her all day until since i have been writing this it is now so dark i must put up my writing we have three soldiers for supper and a nights shelter we can give them no bed but blankets mr taylor was taken sick this evening i hope he may soon recover for his sake and ours i am very anxious to have the wagons fitted up ready to move monday august 31st i believe it is decided at last in two weeks god willing we are to start not to texas to georgia two weeks only two weeks that we are to go to georgia takes not from the sting of this bitter parting for me i have so many things to do in this short time that very little leisure will be left for writing i am now taking a few minutes before breakfast eva was a great deal better yesterday and is this morning i hope she may now gain a little not go back and advance alternately as she has been doing mrs seale and mrs putnam spent the day here yesterday i saw but little of them as i was with eva most of the time willie returned about eleven o'clock saturday night said he had gotten along very well that the negroes were as he expressed it the jolliest set that ever travelled picking the banjo and dancing every time they stopped they will be still more jolly at the prospect of going to georgia dr whyte told us of an outrage perpetrated by the yankees on bayou de sicard they went to mr fithiol's house demanded some gold that he had and when he said that it was out of his power to got it they put five pistols to his head and commanded him to produce he still denied and they put a pistol to his wife's head compelled her to get up in her night dress light the house all over unlock all her trunks and show them throughout the house when they still could not find the money they threatened to burn the house mrs fithiol drew aside the bed curtains and shoved them her children what she said would you burn down the house over four little children children are very common things nowadays we see them every day was the brutal reply they did not burn the house however but took all his negro men but four and left him but four mules out of his twenty four notwithstanding this i must do the yankees the justice to say that their general stevenson was polite politic and that few if any other such outrages were committed it is hard for me to admit that they are polite
wednesday aug 3rd my worst fears for willie's health were realized yesterday my poor brother is sick at columbia and wrote up for father to send the ambulance and a mattress for him he has chills and fever he wrote that he was quite sick but the fact that it was written by another person for him makes us very anxious we cannot expect him till tomorrow at the soonest sent immediately yesterday evening father would have gone but thought it better for willie to have all the room george had a fever all day yesterday and last night we were alarmed by an eruption which appeared on his body sent for dr white early this morning who said the fever was caused by a severe cold and the eruption was nettle rash we have only to be careful that the rash does not strike in a negro child near here broke out with it last week it's mother perceiving it washed it in cold water and in ten minutes the child was a corpse mrs stone and kate arrived yesterday morning mrs stone had been to her place and to millikens bend was rejoiced to get out safe found the old negroes she left on her place faithful and that they had taken care of her silver she brought out a few pieces gave the rest to a yankeeized southern lady at the bend mrs stone got a few goods could not get either tea or coffee says greenbacks are rapidly depreciating she brought out a quantity of new songs books and magazines the fashions are perfect curiosities to us so much changed mrs stone also brought a large packet of papers containing much interesting news an account of the fight between the alabama and the kearsage one by winslow one by semmes both of which agree tolerably also a full account of one raid into maryland which was entirely successful and frightened the yankees to death this is glad news but oh we have so much cause for solicitude in one of the papers there is a long article from the georgia constitutionalist which gives a fair and frank statement of our situation both in virginia and georgia this situation is very critical it fills me with anxiety but i trust that the skilfullness of our generals and the bravery of our troops will yet save our capitol father says if richmond is saved it will be the wonder of the world it will be our pride our joy i pray fervently for divine help in god is our trust and i believe we shall yet joyfully praise him oh how i love and venerate and trust our wise and heroic lee sunday august 7th willie did not come thursday as we hoped and we were quite anxious but friday morning early we heard the ambulance coming i was sleeping up stairs with miss kate stone and was not yet dressed though i had been up some time i was soon down stairs willie was very weak and looked badly indeed he has fallen away so much his cheeks look hollow and his form very thin he has not improved very much since he came home but is as well as one could expect he was very sick indeed with the bilious fever has had no fever since he came home mrs copely and her daughter george spent the day with us wednesday as mrs stone and kate were here we had quite a large party and spent a pleasant day mrs stone left thursday morning for texas i suppose kate will remain with us till next week we were happily surprised friday evening by the coming of mr beck and miss mary i was so glad to see them i hope they will stay some time longer but am afraid they will not as they are so anxious about home that they cannot go up to homer to see mrs barr i do like and admire miss mary beck so much and am so anxious that she should at least like me she brought such a welcome present corinne and les oeuvres choisies de bernardin st pierre containing paul et virginie just what i was wishing for only two days ago and i am so glad to have corinne which i admire so much i prize them more too as coming from miss mary though i suppose she only gave them to me from benevolence poor little lory he has the chills again had the first friday then one yesterday and today he had a very hard chill and high fever which has not yet gone off eva had a chill day before yesterday and one today both rather slight mr gordon was here last night is undecided about going to georgia if he goes it will be about next week i do so hope he will go he is so kind about promising to take my letters and find out where mr ridgill is we had some favourable news about virginia and georgia we have had a battle in georgia and gained a victory though by no means a decisive one but we hope strongly we have also had some slight successes in virginia thursday august 11th it is all so quiet this morning that the bustle and company of the past weeks especially last night seems like some gay dream but i will commence at the first day monday mr beck and miss mary left i was so sorry to see them go and sincerely wished they might have stayed a week longer but their home is so near the river that in these unquiet times they were anxious to get back tuesday miss mary kate and i went into monroe to spend the day with mary stevens i called on mrs harrison at dr calderwood's found both her and miss maggie at home and spent a very pleasant hour we found mrs stevens quite well for her and it was late before we left having obtained a promise from may and mrs copley to come out and spend the night with us and meet miss chaffe a young lady at dr temple's who came down for some dentistrical work and who is a friend and miss copley's mrs c described her to us as a beautiful songstress and as we had a great desire to hear her sing we determined to have her down with us if she would come when at miss calderwood's i borrowed several books from her one of which family pride she recommended very highly so as we had nothing better to do we thought it would interest us to read it aloud accordingly after all our domestic affairs were settled we seated ourselves to our sewing and i was as usual constituted reader after we got into the interest of the story which was not long we were not willing to stop and pursued margaret desmond's mysterious adventures till dinner and immediately after until time for our afternoon dispersion at nearly five in the afternoon as may be supposed i was troubled with a slight hoarseness from which i have not yet recovered my throat feels quite raw this morning and i have been soothing it with loaf sugar while i was dusting the piano mary and mrs copley drove up rested a few minutes and then went out to dr temple's to call on miss chaffe we were soon dressed and followed them we found miss chaffe in a plain dumpy little person with an extremely fair complexion and unfailing smile she accepted my invitation to tea but was going to spend the night with mary stevens who much to our disappointment was obliged to go home that night as her aunt wanted to use the carriage early the next morning perhaps it was better that she did for on our return we found mrs templeton and her two daughters here and we could not possibly have afforded even pallets for so many without putting willie out of his room which of course inadmissable mrs copley told me while she called that she had taken the liberty of inviting for the evening a young gentleman a friend of hers and a devoted admirer of miss chaffe whom we would know by his uniform of artillery lieutenant and by his very small feet clothed in faded pumps we laughed very much at her description of the gentleman's last and apparently most striking characteristic there was quite a circle of us on the piazza when we saw an ambulance driving up a lady holding the reins on it's near approach we recognized lucy seale her mother and a young gentleman clinging to the back of the vehicle whom they introduced as capt gillespie and of whom we had frequently heard kate speak as a cousin of mrs templeton's of by no means a staid disposition or demeanor as we now experienced we prevailed on them to descend from their elevation and join our party and there we sat in formidable array of summer evenings toilets with only three coats interspersed when the solitary pair of faded pumps rode up and manfully facing our bright artillery dismounted and advanced up the steps being introduced to us in a body as lieut coleman ladies he gladly sank into the nearest chair and fell into converse with may his next neighbour in spite of our large party of ladies and our scarcity of young gentlemen the evening passed quickly and pleasantly with that freedom which almost invariably attends accidental reunions mary stevens looked so freshly pretty that i felt like kissing her all the evening we heard the famous voice of good humoured miss chaffe which was very sweet but i thought tiny and not well managed but which some of the company applauded to the skies miss mary sang one song juanita a deep rich song which suits her powerful voice i thought it incomparably superior to miss chaffe's trills and sinkings but the rest of the company did not appear to think so though i remarked the attention the first verse excited and the admiring buzz which filled up the interlude it was late about eleven when mary and her party left and mrs templeton sat up for more than an hour afterwards though i was so tired that my limbs pained and my throat was quite raw and stiff at last however we retired and sleep came gratefully as soon as my head touched the pillow this morning after breakfast mrs templeton left taking kate with her to pay a visit at her house at oak ridge willie is much improved the last two days is much stronger but still looks very badly father went to the flouring mill at downsville this morning to have our little crop of twenty five bushels of wheat ground it is only sixteen miles and he will be back tomorrow we have not yet had any decisive news from atlanta but hear some vague rumours about our position there which awaken much anxiety and disquiet in our minds saturday night aug 13th nothing has happened since i wrote last father returned from mill yesterday afternoon we also finished reading our book after having read all day my eyes were very tired and i wanted to walk over to mrs craig's but mother thought the walk too wet and proposed that i should go down to mrs leighton's i was just walking up to the gate when willie saw me and claimed my promise to take a buggy ride with him the evening had been so wet i thought he had abandoned the idea i called at mrs leighton's to return des confidences and thank her for the pleasure it had given me chatted rapidly for about five minutes and left with the great prize of the first volume of lamartine's histoire des girondins we had a delightful ride when we were coming home we had the glorious sunset sky before us and all around the golden light was reflected by the brilliant green foliage all wet and shining from the recent rain this evening we have had a fine rain one of my beloved rainy evenings we intended to have called on mrs hayward from homer who is at mrs temple's but the rain prevented i nothing loath sat at my window to watch the rain and read madame de sevigné's sprightly letters but i had not spent more than an hour with this charming french woman when i took out my package of valeria's precious letters and read them with far tenderer interest they awoke such affectionate longing feelings in my heart that i could not refrain from expressing then somewhat and notwithstanding the uncertainty of mr gordon's crossing the river i determined to write and hastily taking out a sheet of paper commenced night found me still at my delightful and absorbing employment while we were at supper a mysterious event happened rose saw a man on horseback pass the window and on going immediately to the front door saw him going down to the other gate she did not speak and he passed on we at first thought it might be uncle jim going for the cows as they had not come up as usual but on susannah's coming in with the milk soon after father sent out to the stables to see if any horses were missing they were all there we might have thought rose mistaken but that we sent up to the gates and found them both open a very uncourteous visitor whoever he be i fancy he just came in malice prepense to leave the gates open and let in the pigs we hear rumours of a raid the yankees have made into georgia from hilton head but nothing certain monday night aug 15th willie rode into trenton this evening in the buggy is ordered into camp as soon as he is able to go the ride in tired him very much i have been anxious for him to quit the quartermaster's service and now that he is about to leave i find myself full of a kind of upraiding feeling as if it were not kind or sisterly of me to wish him away i begin to feel all kinds of unnumbered fears for his body and soul my heart is tonight agitated and troubled and in addition i feel very nervous and tired we have had cloudy or rainy weather since saturday mrs hayward miss lizzie tradewell and sallie dreux spent the day with us sunday i like miss lizzie tradewell more and more as i become acquainted with her i met her in homer where she and her grandmother were very polite and kind to me they are from florida but miss tradewell has been to school in savannah where she has an aunt living there is a little something about her that reminds me of valeria perhaps it is only because valeria is so constantly in my thoughts i long for her daily willie heard today that the yankees in their raid from hilton head had gone as far as macon and had burned the oconee railroad bridge but that they had all been surrounded and captured probably by our own brave militia oh how it makes my heart throb with proud thankful joy to think of it the oconee bridge was built by father it was in a manner the commencement of his railroad career how anxious we are to hear news of atlanta the yankees on their raid must have passed right by uncle david's i wish we could hear from them the mysterious horseman who passed through our yard the other night was no more romantic personage than a poor half blind soldier who brought a note from dr temple to his wife and probably mistook this for his house he stayed at dr temple's all night and went off the next morning to hunt conscripts wednesday aug 17th how lightened my mind feels tonight of the heavy burden which has so long pressed upon oh have i indeed made one stop towards that end which has long been to me the highest mr lawson the episcopal minister from bastrop is coming down to monroe to preach on sunday and tonight i told mother about how i had long desired to join the church she said i might see mr lawson sunday unworthy as i am of this high privilege i feel it will give new life to every effort in duty and oh how inexpressibly it will soothe my weary and often doubtful soul if i am thought fit for this sovereign mercy friday evening aug 19th i have just come in from the room where they are warping our first piece of cloth it looks so pretty and i could not help putting my fingers in to the leese as they call it crossed the threads correctly and was full of my triump mrs lidwell kindly came up to show alice how to warp tomorrow they are going to put it into the loom mrs lidwell says it is very nicely spun miss mary attends to the spinning has two regular spinners one caroline does seven cuts very easily the other susannah has been lazy and only spun five but yesterday miss mary told her she must do six or finish her task after dark she brought in only five and a half miss mary was faithful to her promise and she brought in the other half cut in a surprisingly short space of time i received a letter from my dear aunt mary yesterday the first one in a year though she says she has written many her letter was affectionate and interesting and was truly welcome i do not now feel so utterly cut off from georgia as before for this letter came by mail in the short time of one month she had only received two of my letters but one was the long one that i wrote first and which described our affairs most fully miss mary came at this point in my writing and called me away to accompany her in a rattling ride home with mrs lidwell we went in the ambulance and had a delightful ride through the mud it has been raining almost continually since last saturday but now as i raise my eyes i behold with rapture the golden lined clouds in the west which give cheering hope of a fair day tomorrow while they fill our souls with love and rapture in the calm evening hour see how rapidly the bright hues are changing and soon there will be left the deep peaceful light in the sky through which the stars shine so softly i am particularly anxious this rainy weather should break now so that we may go to church on sunday willie is away today went down to millhaven he is improving very fast i hope he will be strong before next thursday he has set that as the day to leave while mother was up the country eldridge saw a horse at mrs brantley's which he thought resembled pompey willie's lost pony so willie sent antony up there to see and he returned with an affirmative answer it appears that one of mrs brantley's sons had traded for it at shreveport so willie knowing mrs brantley to be a hard woman has gone to get mr mcquiller from he bought pompey to go up with him as proof sad to think that this should be thought necessary but such are these degenerate days when oaths are often lightly taken and still more lightly broken tuesday morning mrs dortch sent up an invitation for me to come down as she expected miss maggie calderwood and laura barnes to come out i accepted her invitation with pleasure and spent a very pleasant day though the rain prevented miss maggie and miss laura from coming i think miss kane a very pleasant young lady we have passed many of the hours of this rainy week with great pleasure and profit in reading the talisman aloud like almost all of scott's novels it is admirable the first few chapters rather dragged a little owing i suppose to the preoccupation of my mind but after that we were all intensely interested the air which comes through my window has something of the bracing coolness of autumn i hope the heats of the summer are broken i look forward to the winter as a time when i shall be able to do much more than i have during this oppressive and languid summer my fears for its gloominess are less it seems to me much of the bitterness has gone out of my heart since wednesday evening but let me not be too presumptuous the enemy only waits occasion to tempt me i received a letter from mrs morancy the other evening she says mrs barr will gladly take miss mary and eva if she can get the room fixed i hope they will be able to go it will improve them both i think in some things miss mary depends too much upon she will when away be obliged to exert her own powers but how we shall miss them willie too away ours will indeed be a changed family tuesday evening aug 23rd i sit down this evening to chronicle the great event of our year we have our first piece of cloth in the loom and while i write i hear alice weaving mrs lidwell came over yesterday and put it in but she made a mistake and had to put it in over again today i congratulate myself that the mysteries of weaving are beginning to be elucidated in my mind i now understand plain cloth and really think i could put in a piece myself yesterday i handed up the thread to mrs lidwell and tired my arm so that it pained me all the evening willie returned from mrs brantley's sunday evening did not get pompey antony made a mistake the horse was very much like but in willie's opinion at least not equal to that non pareil willie's ride brought back his fever he did not feel well sunday evening and yesterday he had quite a fever sent for dr whyte took medicine and kept his bed this morning and this afternoon is up and has no fever i hope it will not come back we went into monroe sunday but how disappointed we were when we found that mr lawson had not come we heard an earnest and fervent sermon from old mr mcguire and i felt benefited by it but i was so much disappointed about seeing mr lawson i have now to put off further the purpose of opening my heart to him on that nearest and highest subject that which i feel is so imperatively my duty and which i must perform before i can hope for enduring peace of mind we had the pleasure of welcoming a visit from dr mcdonough the other evening his came saturday soon after dinner was away yesterday and today but we expect him back tonight we are very glad indeed to see him again the hospital has moved back here again in the same houses it occupied last winter we are so sorry dr mcdonough is not with it but i don't believe he wants to come dr furness is the chief with dr melton for an assistant we shall probably have opportunities for perfecting our acquaintance with the former have not seen him yet mr gordon is here this evening will remain all night i suppose i am very much afraid he will not go to georgia oh if he only would how rejoiced i would be we had a lame soldier here sunday and yesterday father was at the quartermaster's office in trenton the other day and found him there trying to get transportation father brought him out this far and this morning he left on one of the hospital wagons he lives about twenty miles from homer is named peace has been in the army three years wounded twice the last time was at chicka mauga where he was shot in the ankle and now he has to walk on crutches he appears to be a very good honest young man has not heard from his family since vicksburg fell and says he supposes his mother and father think he is dead what a glad surprise his return will be the weather is delightful now we appreciate it so much after the rain my geranium is growing so beautifully and the heliotropes are luxuriant the little garden looks so beautiful in the morning when the heavy dew actually drips from the plants
friday september 6th 1861 since i wrote last miss mary has entirely recovered from her attack willie had another chill wednesday night and a fever last night he is up today but looks rather like an invalid our society met yesterday we gave out a good many shirts to make and also a basket of yarn every body seems desirous to do their part of the soldier's work mrs cauthorn and mrs dillard came home to dinner with us monday mrs noble mother and i went up to the meeting of the society at zion hill six miles from here but they had changed the day of meeting and we went up to mrs bennett's house we had never seen her before but her daughter miss newcomb is the secretary of the society and mrs noble had been invited there they received us very cordially mrs bennett is from the vicinity of milledgeville she and mother had many acquaintances in common the bennetts have been here twelve years miss newcomb is a very nice young lady she showed me her scrap book herbarium and many other little treasures mother spent the day with mrs bry tuesday wednesday she and mrs cauthorn went into monroe father left for vicksburg yesterday we expect him back tonight yesterday evening carrie young invited me to go to ride with her we went in her buggy we have had warm weather lately it has not rained this week sunday sep 15th 1861 i cannot help feeling sad this evening oh when we think what may be before us how can any of us be aught but sad father mother and major bry have just walked over to dr young's who returned from virginia thursday night dr young is in high spirits and expects that we will be victorious and that soon but oh if we are how many many bleeding hearts will that victory cost i sicken at the thought father and major bry think that the war will continue through lincoln's administration but i pray that god in his mercy may avert this trial i have never contemplated a long war i have steeled myself to bear great and bloody battles and many privations and even suffering for a little while but four long years of war of suspense which is worse than defeat almost my heart sinks my courage utterly fails can i bear it but why speak thus i know i must bear it and it only rests with me to decide whether i shall bear cheerfully or repiningly i hope i may be enabled to be cheerful and i sometimes think i can be so but there are moments of darkness in which i cannot think of the brightness which is often hid by clouds and waits but for the stormy wind to scatter them and make its glory apparent oh that i might have grace given me to wait on the lord's good pleasure i am too impatient and i sometimes fear that god has wholly withdrawn his countenance from me else i should not so rebel against his chastisements i think too much of my sorrows and too little of my blessings truly god has been very kind to me and though he has sent trials to me yet how do i know but that if it had not been for them i should never have tested the sweetness of god's mercy father has been sick since i wrote last he was caught in the rain last friday night and took a chill he was quite sick but was able to leave for vicksburg on thursday he returned last night father was unfortunate on his journey home at one of the stations he met with a very bad man who opened a conversation with him about some cattle which had been killed on the road and for which father had refused to pay an exorbitant price after speaking a few words father walked off where upon the man followed and used exceedingly abusive language to him he continued this language until father forgot himself and turning back slapped the man upon the face in the scuffle which ensued the man bit both father's thumbs and scratched his face it the first fight father ever had and this in his forty seventh year little jim is now quite sick we called in doctor whyte friday he said that if had been suffered to run on it would have terminated in typhoid fever miss mary eva and i passed the day at mrs bry's yesterday in the evening we went to monroe for father i have been very busy this week have knit a pair of socks how many more will i knit before the war closes i am afraid i shall have time to get accustomed to it before i cease my hand is now quite lame from constant knitting saturday sep 21st 61 father and miss mary and both sick again father went to bed thursday and has not been up since he insisted at first that all he needed was rest and would not let mother send for the doctor but yesterday he consented and mother sent dr whyte says that father has only a slow fever but that he has needed medicine for some time he left calomel and quinine father is very weak but feels a little better this evening miss mary had a slight chill this morning and has had fever ever since as usual she is exceedingly nervous and very much discouraged little jim has been up for two or three days he is now quite well miss mary and i spent monday at mrs noble's we were invited there to meet mrs richardson mrs noble's niece and her children she is a very pleasant lady and we enjoyed the day yesterday misses puss and hannah bry and carrie young spent the day with us i should have enjoyed myself very much had i not had a headache and been almost incapacitated for enjoyment of any kind in the afternoon a very heavy rain came up our house leaked all over and was kept constantly moving out of the rain this morning it cleared off cool the air is rather damp and it has seemed like a real autumn day we must expect many such days now autumn is really here many of the leaves are turning and some of the black gum trees are almost bare mrs noble has resigned her position as president of the society and last wednesday mother was elected in her stead i have neglected my journal very much lately not because i did not wish to write but because i have not felt justified in taking the time i have been so busy knitting and sewing that i have not had a moment to spare the week and months pass before i am aware and yet when i look back it seems a long and weary time the events of last month seem to have taken place almost a year ago i have not written one very important thing uncle dole has a baby a little girl she is seven weeks old aunt satira thinks her beautiful aunt mary writes that she and grandma are knitting for the soldiers i received a letter from miss valeria night before last they have all had chills sometimes four or five in bed at once john and angus have gone to a military school in nashville tenn i have been so busy that i have not had time to mention in my journal the burning of mr water's house at amite by some companies of the polish brigade which were encamped there the soldiers had annoyed mr waters very much by stealing his fruit and breaking his trees notwithstanding he freely gave to them when asked at last he threatened to shoot them and finding them in his field one day he shot at two of them not intending however to do more than frighten them as it happened he killed one and wounded another when it was found out many of the soldiers were greatly enraged and coming to his house razed it to the ground in spite of the efforts of the officers and a few of the men they broke down the fruit trees and fences burned the barns and store room and demolished a year's provisions mr waters preserved his life by flight while the ladies of his family remained all night surrounded by the ruffians they providentially escaped unhurt miss calwell wrote me a full account of it in her words mr waters is ruined they must be in great distress as he can get no employment and he had no property except his house in amite miss valeria says that the people of amite were in terror lest they should burn the town before they left there was one company the gross tete guards which guarded the town several nights this is a dreadful tale too tell of our own soldiers there is but one consolation and this is that they are not our own countrymen they are most of them the low foreign population of new orleans our country soldiers are many of them accomplished gentlemen and all are men of humanity and honesty the night is coming on in darkness and gloom the sky is grey and cold and the north wind sounds drearily this is one of the melancholy days the saddest of the year our indoor scene is not one to raise the spirits and when we seek refuge in thought we but increase the gloom i would not allow weather or privations to sadden me but i can scarce bear up against sadness when i seen father and mother so depressed father is so sad we must try and remember that though sorrow may endure for a night joy cometh in the morning friday sept 27th 61 oh it is cold very cold for september last night the wind whistled round the house like winter pa is having a clay chimney built today we are going to have a fire in it tonight it will be so delightful this morning we all went to breakfast wrapped up in blankets father has been wearing a blanket in the form of a poncho all day yesterday we all went chinquapen hunting misses puss hannah and florence bry katie and wiley noble carrie adam willie and charlie young and all our family except georgie and john we went in the great lumber wagon with four mules carried little jim and eldridge along we went first to mr nash's place where we found ever so many chinquapens and then to mrs phillips place which carrie said was much prettier to gather them we ate our dinner there under some beautiful beech trees on the slope of a hill where the ground was all covered with green grass and dry pine straw and where we could get plenty of water from the spring near by every body was in good spirits and we enjoyed ourselves very much we did not gather more than two hours and we had over a bushel of chinquapens when we came to divide them we came home before sunset a long time but as we carried every body home we did not arrive such before dark we had two flags in the wagon and hurrahed at every house we passed some of the people thought we were soldiers and came way out to the road to see mother and father went to monroe yesterday and took georgie with them miss mary had a chill monday and willie had one tuesday father is improving but very slowly mrs batchelor spent the day with us tuesday she is a lady teacher who is spending her vacation near here mother went to see her the other evening and invited her spend the day with us with a view of forming an opinion of her as a teacher i think her very pleasant and sensible should be pleased if we could engage her she has never taught in a family and is undecided as to whether she would like it the sun is near it's setting and i am beginning to feel cold i must go and see how the chimney gets along
saturday sept 13th we commenced school a week ago monday and have been studying steadily ever since it seems natural to be in school again and makes me feel happier mrs dwight is an excellent french and music scholar and i am perfectly satisfied with her as a teacher for me but i am afraid that she is not all i at first thought and not capable of disciplining the mind of a child eva does not understand her studies as she ought to do and miss mary though she has improved in some things needs to have her mind strengthened and excited to think and reason however what can't be helped must be endured and i must try to make the most of my advantages while i have them it is almost the middle of september i can hardly believe that winter is so near yesterday evening the air was really like fall today it has been warmer our house gets on slowly they are now at work on the pantry mr axley is making sash willie commenced making brick about two weeks ago our chimneys cannot be finished until those bricks are burned uncle moses left for georgia on wednesday i spent the day with aunt jane thursday at mrs garrett's miss sarah garrett is a very pleasant young lady i think i should like her very much we have had no rain yet several times it has clouded up thundered and lightened and a few drops fallen but not enough to lay the dust i must close my book now and get ready to go over to dr young's to see carrie and the misses compton we have so many neighbors to visit that i seldom spend an evening at home they will soon leave now that fall is coming on willie and i took a ride with miss julia and miss tabitha thursday evening enjoyed it very much only miss julia's pony stumbled and threw her off but she was not hurt emmeline had a baby on the 4th wednesday sep 18th i have time this evening to write a few lines in my journal and this is a thing of such rare occurrence that i must not let the opportunity pass i was very much relieved and rejoiced day before yesterday by a long letter from miss valeria telling me all about their removal from amite and their journeyings to sharon mississippi again today i received a letter from her i cannot express what joy these letters gave me though they indeed contained some things that saddened it i cannot bear to think of their discomforts of both mind and body in their present unsettled condition and then how must they not feel about john and angus john is in longstreet's division constantly near the enemy and has been in several battles though held in reserve with angus it has been still worse poor boy my heart bleeds for him he has been sick for eight weeks with typhoid fever it is the third serious illness he has had since he left home is unable to serve and it is extremely doubtful if he can get release or even a furlough i can sympathize with his family for though i have not passed through the ordeal the very thought of willie's having to suffer so makes so shudder then i feel near to angus too i always have liked him he is so frank and lovable we are having good news from the war now on every side our armies are triumphant and are driving the yankees from tennessee kentucky and virginia while vicksburg stands firm and we hear that the yankees are dying by hundreds in new orleans this last is an awful thing to rejoice over and yet such the fate of a bloody war and such are the feelings which it engenders even in the merciful heart of a woman father left us this morning for jackson we do not expect him home until next wednesday he is improving very much now and i rejoice to see that with health he is regaining his spirits mrs wilson moved to the swamp monday fall is already here i am just beginning to realize that it is the middle of september we have had no rain yet last night there was a very cold drizzle which lasted for about half an hour and then every appearance of a storm we thought that the ecquinoctial gale was at hand but it passed away in a short time today has been clear and very warm but this evening it is quite chilly the sky is threatening and we hear distant thunder now and then miss julia compton spent the day here today or rather took dinner here she and mother went to trenton this evening they have not yet returned though it is nearly dark and expect them every moment the work on the house appears to progress more rapidly now yesterday and today they put up the bookshelves in the parlour i long for the time to come when we may arrange the books on them mr axley will soon be done the sash for my room and the pantry is nearly finished father said yesterday that he expected to move us downstairs when he returned next week the clouds are very black oh may they bring rain the earth is parched like a brick and the dust is over the shoetops monday sep 29th 1862 we have had two or three good rains since i wrote last the cloud i spoke of in my last entry did indeed bring rain a dreadful storm mother and julia compton were in the whole of it when they arrived they were of course drenched to the skin julia spent the night here she rather enjoyed her adventure than otherwise she is a frank pleasant girl but not of very great depth of character one cannot avoid liking her however nor can one be ceremonious with her the whole family arrived yesterday and went up to their place the weather is now quite warm last week the mornings and evenings were very cool indeed friday night two soldiers lodged here they belong to wall's texas legion company sunderland braves cavalry one of them was but seventeen years old and looked much younger his complexion was not yet bronzed by exposure and he had very fair hair and pretty blue eyes one could almost imagine him some fair maiden in disguise mrs dwight said to him were not your parents unwilling for you to leave home so young he answered pa said i was too young to come but ma said that i wanted to come and it was not right to keep me the other soldier could not have been more than twenty but he was the perfect opposite of his companion large muscular with a brown face jet black hair hazel eyes and a slight black moustache he spoke more than the other and appeared very intelligent and well bred though quite plain he was very gallant too and proud of texas and her soldiers and his company and captain a division of the legion passed the next morning before he left he told us of the different companies as they passed their hurrahs for louisiana and the ladies were deafening we said that some of the troops did not hurrah to us though we waved to them ah said he they don't know any better there are a great many dutch among them who don't care for anything i despise them then as his company came along he said see thats our company they all take off their hats and sure enough they did there's capt sunderland added he proudly see him taking off his cap and hurrahing he shook hands with us warmly and said ladies if i survive this war i shall certainly call again then mounting his horse he pricked him with his great texas spurs and galloped off looking very handsome his company recognized him while he was standing talking to us and commenced to shout hurrah for ray hurrah for ray i should not think they could recognize you from so far said i oh yes he replied i am the orderly serjeant and they think a good deal of me capt smith came down here last night he is going away tomorrow morning father is going to send for salt by him so willie will not go i am so glad i did not like to think of willie's being absent so long they were getting the wagon ready this evening it seemed strange to see its great white top in our yard the salt will probably cost father five dollars a bushel and the hauling of about seventy miles mrs williams will move this week there will then be none of the summer residents here except major bry's family the good news from the war continues to arrive we hear of some new feat of arms nearly every day longstreet's division has been in nearly all the late battles i tremble to think of john ridgill mr green's company is also in that division oh for peace but war rather than peace except with perfect independence and this the infatuated north is not yet willing to give us miss mary and i planted some violets on grandma's grave friday they were part of those mrs drake gave us grandma used to watch their growth with us little did she think they would bloom upon her grave oh how constantly we should remember that death is ever near us
wednesday september 2nd 1863 eva is improving had no fever yesterday or today we hope she can sit up a little tomorrow we are all very busy preparing to leave father has been blacksmithing for the last two days as mr taylor's attack proved quite serious and we are anxious to leave at the earliest possible moment sometimes i feel as if i cannot wait the prescribed ten days for what may not happen before then i am filled with forebodings this country on this side the mississippi is almost in a state of anarchy we are so afraid that willie may be conscripted before we can get off he intends to join the army in virginia as soon as possible but to have him conscripted and in the army here would be dreadful mr frank garrett and capt wiltz stayed here last night capt wiltz says that on thanksgiving a few days ago many of the officers at shreveport and a great many citizens went to church when behold a guard surrounded the building and arrested every man as he came out what an outrage to humanity such we must think though perpetrated in our own country they were in search of conscripts every one is taken up now in a few days the conscript officers may come here oh it is terrible to think of father is going to send willie off in a day or two on a reconnoitering expedition into the swamp we will leave at the earliest possible day a convention has just been held at marshall texas of the governors of texas louisiana arkansas and missouri the judges of the supreme court the members of legislature and the generals all the generals on this side except magruder and one other in this convention they have adopted some very singular resolutions which virtually amount to the severance of these four states from the government at richmond general kirby smith has extraordinary powers bestowed on him powers equal to those of the president it is feared that an attempt may be made to establish a new federation over here if this be so we must get away as soon as possible oh it is dreadful i feel like weeping over my country what will we become our enemies are those that are in the midst of us with the yankees we can cope and yet there is a faith in me that bids me look forward to a time when i may be proud of this poor torn and bleeding country but oh how far distant i tremble to think of the future friday sept 4th willie left us this morning i need not say how sad it was on father's return from monroe yesterday he said it was not safe for willie to remain longer the military had returned to monroe and he might be conscripted at any time so hasty preparations were made last night and this mornings and about nine o'clock his horse was packed with blankets saddlebags gun and tin cup and willie dressed in his soldier shirt had thrown his coat over the saddle mr burke's mule was also packed and nothing remained but to say goodbye brandon went off gaily as is his wont shall i ever see him or his rider again willie and mr burke are going on a reconnoitering expedition as well as to keep themselves out of the way father has been obliged to apply for passports to cross the river and col bartelett dispatched a courier to gen'l abair yesterday it will be several days before we hear whether or not we can go father has applied for passports for himself and four railroad employees including of course willie he thinks it probable that we may get passports while they are refused to the young men if this is the case they will join us in the swamp and go without them if we are not permitted to go willie will go on to georgia and from there to virginia to join the washington artillery with john and angus mr burke will accompany him to georgia where his family are i do so long to be on the road i gorget my grief at leaving home in the thought of being separated from willie and then it is so hard to feel that in truth we have no law eva is improving fast she took a ride in the carriage this evening is not yet able to sit up all day however mr bowmar barr called here this morning is searching for his family left his wife at her father's in tensas parish says he will be back here in about a week if he overtakes his mother if we get permission we shall leave here as soon as possible we are very busy i have made two pair of little pantelettes for john today i never sewed so much in a day before george is not at all well has not been for several days he had a chill yesterday and another today mother to going to give him quinine tomorrow it is so dark i can not write any more tuesday sept 8th our passport came sunday but is only for father his family and negroes and any other persons he may wish to take who are not included in the conscription it makes little difference as the others can go without a passport we shall try and leave here a week from today willie will join us down in the swamp george has had four chills but mother gave him quinine sunday and he has had none since he looks very badly and we fear is taking the hooping cough john has also been a little sick but has recovered col stevens died last thursday thursday sept 10th i was at tabitha scarborough's wedding tuesday night she married mr shields poor girl i fear she has not made a wise choice the wedding was very small no guests but miss sarah garrett and myself and a few young gentlemen i could not help feeling sad most of the persons present had met at our fish fry at crew lake and mary and col stevens were there in such high spirits poor mary she is so desolate i went in to monroe to see her yesterday evening and she called here this morning she is so changed her sorrow is bitter but she does not weep she cannot only yesterday when i accompanied her to their changed home and she looked at his portrait she was overcome and this morning sitting here in this room where we had sat so happily she wept several times and seemed relieved my heart bleeds for her it is as if she had lost two fathers in one year for col stevens was a father to her indeed she will miss him far more than she did her own she says she felt it sad enough when she was left motherless and fatherless but never knew desolation before mrs stevens was very ill before her husband died and cannot walk now mary says she knows that her aunt too will soon leave her mary came down with her uncle's corpse to the burial at monroe she came on monday oh how am i stilled blessed i tremble lest some of mine should be taken this trouble and uncertainty wears much upon my dear father i wish we were away we have not heard from willie yet but expect news from him this evening we cannot leave before next thursday at the least i am afraid we cannot get off then there is so much to do to fit up the wagons and make yokes and chains and so many other things mother's preparations are nearly finished except packing and as we shall carry only necessaries this must be left till the last few days i want to see willie so much tomorrow will be a week since he left us a long week it has been mother and i are going to call on the bride this evening mrs shields how strange it sounds i feel but little inclined to go mary stevens is in my heart all the time i feel so much for her that it is almost like a grief of my own saturday sept 12th yesterday morning we were perfectly and delightfully surprised by willie's return he had been to the mississippi he saw no yankees at all says that transports are continually passing up and down the river but never land either in mississippi or louisiana he thinks we will be obliged to build a flat and ferry ourselves across in the night dear willie he is such a help to us and it is such a comfort to have him at home again how i shall miss him when he goes to the army but i would not keep him back on any account we think we shall be able to leave next saturday just one week from today i hope it will not pass as slowly as the past two my poor little molly my beautiful little pet has the sweeney she goes very lame and has lost her old fleetness her shoulder is beginning to shrink and i am afraid her beauty will soon be gone willie's present i have always prized her highly and she was such a perfect beauty so spirited and fleet miss mary and i took a ride yesterday evening our horses had not been watered and molly was very thirsty so when we arrived at mrs britt's i asked them to give her some water i held a basin for a drink from but it did not satisfy her and when we left i enquired the way to the well it was about a quarter of a mile from the house and the most desolate looking place there was a single log cabin right in the woods several benches for tanning leather and washing some clothes hung on lines stretched from tree to tree and the well it had a few boards nailed up around it and two pieces of rails crossed at each end on these the windlass rested the bucket was a keg sawed off and there was a tub near to pour the water in we rode up to the cabin and asked the poor pale woman who came to the door if there was any one there who could draw some water for our horses she said no one but me of course i disclaimed any wish to have her do it and rode back to the well molly must have water if i had to draw it so draw it i must i rode up to a log dismounted gave the reins and my cane to miss mary drew off my gloves threw them on a log and went to the windlass my dress was terribly in my way and the bucket was very heavy but i went to work with both hands furnishing quite a laughable spectacle for miss mary but when i had drawn the bucket then came the trouble railroad would not wait for me to empty it and i could not get the rope loose and between my anxiety lest i should wet and soil my dress and my exertions to keep railroad from drinking from the bucket i got into a perfect heat but finally i emptied it into the tub and the plash of the pouring water was scarcely more agreeable to the thirsty horses than it was to me old railroad was selfish and impolite enough to drink the whole bucket full from molly and i was obliged to draw another for my pet i succeeded a little better than i had the first time and after letting her fully quench her thirst i drew a long breath led her to the nearest stump and mounted very quickly the dear little thing is so ambitious she tried to go usual but could not keep up with railroad's fast pace eva is not very well today she looks very pale thursday night she had an attack of cholera morbus which made her lose all that she had previously gained it is very warm this evening we hoped to have some rain just after dinner but it resulted in nothing but a little sprinkle thursday sept 17th we have been packing all the week i have nearly finished my preparations for the journey my trunk stands packed on one side the table the valise on the other the bookshelves and mantelpiece are bare and so is the table except of baskets papers and bottles and other things to be used on the way my desk is almost empty only my journal book portfolio account book and inkstands remaining and a precious bundle of valeria's letters which i did not put in the box with my other papers my dear old desk must be left here and i may never see it again this may be the last time i shall write upon it i value this bureau above all my other possessions we had hoped to be able to leave on the coming saturday but have not been able to get ready we think now we shall start on tuesday next mother is not well this morning has one of her severe head aches father is very unwell he has a dreadful cold in the head but will not lie down yesterday we were very much surprised by the arrival of johnny stone i scarcely knew him when he rode up not that he was changed at all but his coming was so unexpected he came down for some sugar that mrs stone left here said they were all well thursday night mrs phillips came down today came to see about going with us she wrote a note to mother the other day saying that she would like to go as far as montgomery alabama under father's protection said she had conveyance for herself and baggage provisions servant and all things necessary for the journey today it appears that she has no conveyance and but little prospect of obtaining one i am very sorry for her but my charity does not go far enough for me to wish for her company on the way it may be wrong i may judge her unkindly but i do not cannot like her society oakland sept 21st 1863 monday night this is the last time i shall ever date my journal from this dear home i feel as if it were the last though father says we may come back everything is packed the wagons are drawn out in line and loaded the furniture carried upstairs and our mattresses laid on the floor for the last night's sleep tomorrow god willing we leave we start on our journey we cannot foresee the end wisely perhaps it is hidden from us oh my beloved home everything looked so beautiful in the light of the setting sun when it next sets we shall be far away it is nearly six years since we left our first oakland but that was nothing so sad as this public and private grief both press upon us now we must take up our cross we must learn resignation eva is not at all well today she had fever this morning and looks pale and very thin george had a chill and fever yesterday and we have all bad colds not in a very good condition for travelling but i hope the journey will improve us poor willie has a severe cold and was so much fatigued tonight that he retired before supper johnny stone called this evening to bid us goodbye he is going back to texas we are going to georgia i cannot judge which has chosen the best mr barr was here this evening i sent a note to mrs morancy by him mrs phillips did not come down this evening i suppose she has concluded not to go with us tuesday sept 22nd 1863 we have reached our first camping place we are started we left home this morning at nine o'clock and are about fourteen miles on our way this has been an eventful day to us we have had all kinds of adventures when we left home we came round by trenton to bid mrs seale goodbye and father and willie and mr duvall went the natchitoches road with the wagons at the ferry father came up with us and the first words he greeted us with were we have broke down it was a dreadful sound to us after all our trouble and painstaking to have broken down within three or four miles of home father sent us all on while he and the carpenters remained with the broken wagon we hope he may overtake us tomorrow night it is very bad for us not to have him with us this first night of our long journey we rode up to mr mcguire's to bid them goodbye old mr mcguire shook my hand and said farwell sary i hope you may have a safe journey these goodbyes are sad the saddest one today was the first miss mary and i rode on ahead to tell dr whyte to send some one down to the house at mrs willson's tabitha and agnes came out to tell us goodbye i felt almost overcome at leaving home and when i met tabitha could only bow my head in her hand and cry we stopped at mrs roane's and then drove down to major bry's on our way we met emmeline who ran from the promiscuous group of wagons cart and negroes drawn up in the shade near the ferry and told mother that an officer had ordered every team not to stir till the colonel came up mother was then in trouble indeed there was father way back on the other side the river willie was there too and mr duvall at the other side of the ferry seeing to the ox teams she hastened on to take major bry's counsel and sent by his negro boy a note to father telling him of our trouble and begging him not to let willie come near monroe for mother's first idea was that they wanted to search the wagons to conscript willie in the meantime poor little george had taken a chill and lay in major bry's arm chair with a fever after about a half hour of trouble we heard that the col had come and the maj walked up to see what was the matter he soon returned with a very grave face we all looked eager he said no use you can't think of leaving here under two weeks you've got to show your passport first now our passport was at vienna father did not wish to get it until mrs duvall's name was put down and it was delayed till col bartlett went away we were all mute in agony but maj bry said oh i've made a mistake you can start this evening how glad we were mother immediately dispatched another messenger to pa and we went to dinner after dinner loring came up with a chill poor child it has gone off now but he is very cross no wonder we left major bry's at about two o'clock and came on very quietly for four or five miles through beautiful shady woods the greater part of the way though at first there were some long lanes without a tree for shade miss mary and i were walking our horse along quietly the carriage following after when all at once zuleika commenced to kick up in front of us mollie kicked and stamped and railroad plunged and reared violently i did not know what it was until suddenly i saw and cried out we are in a hornet's nest ride out quick i spoke to mollie and the dear little creature galloped out immediately though the hornets were on her neck as soon as i was out of danger i looked around miss mary was running frantically up the road wringing her hands and crying out to uncle jim who had stopped quite still drive out of the hornet's nest and as i hurriedly galloped up oh sarah mollie will kick me mollie will kick me all the three children were screaming poor loring was stung on the ear as soon as we got a little quieted i found out that miss mary had been nearly thrown that jeff a negro man who was with us had caught him and she had jumped off and a hornet had stung her on the little finger we soon applied hartshorn and all got started again miss mary and i rode slowly behind jeff walked by the side of us and we talked of the disaster miss mary said oh jeff i am so glad you were there i said it is well jeff stayed behind jeff answered yes mistis i am glad i was in that place i would'nt have that horse hurt you for ten hundred thousand dollars but it is getting dark i have been sitting out here on this log too long and maybe i can do something at the camp which is just screened from me by some bushes we are camped in what was once an old field it is covered with close green grass and there are little bushes grown all around we have seen a few pines today i thought we should see none after we left the hills i like horseback travelling very much thus far do not feel much tired tonight it is so much pleasanter than the carriage poor mother was very much crowded father had the buggy and loring was obliged to go in the carriage it is packed full of little things too eva looks very well tonight i think the ride has improved her la fourche bridge noon sept 23rd wednesday we are at our second camp broken down again two wheels to fill and two tires to shrink last night when i went back into camp i found them preparing the beds it was then that we felt the want of father everything was confused at last by willie's strenuous exertions the mattresses were laid down in the wagon and mother sent some one to make the bed without going to look at it we put some boards across from one carriage seat to the other laid the cushions on them spread cloaks and blankets down pinned shawls up at the windows and put loring and eva to bed in there they had an excellent bed but eva was tired and wanted to be quiet loring was restless and hungry so they gassed a good deal we all gathered round the camp fire and heard something that made us feel very gloomy and long more earnestly than ever for father's presence willie commenced by telling us that fox was lost and then by degrees we learned that many of the negro men had gotten drunk in monroe while our wagons were halted there and among them one jim burke a young negro who was formerly an excellent servant but has been rather troublesome lately about four miles from monroe this man was calling out for mr duvall willie asked him what he wanted he returned in an insolent way that he wanted to see him willie repeated the question and the same answer was returned willie then stepped up to him and said can't you see me sir he answered flatly that he wouldn't willie then picked up a stick not knowing he was intoxicated and knocked him several times the negro then went away a few minutes and the others say he killed fox at any rate fox has not been seen since mr duvall gave the man a pass and sent him up to little creek where his wife is and where we were going to send for her this occurrence made us feel very badly we felt sorry that fox was killed but this was not so bad for we did not think he could stand the journey being so old and so long used to quiet but the act showed us with what an unstable and dangerous an element we had to deal and our minds were full of anxious forebodings hunger however soon reminded us of the basket of cold chicken pork and biscuit the doughnuts which we had prepared and mother and mr duvall found a cup of hot tea very refreshing after supper we grew sleepy and went to examine our beds but then came the trouble with the assistance of several of the servants mother climbed up into the wagon but looked down upon us in dismay and at once decided that that sleeping place would not do it was not large enough for more than one and mother said john would certainly tumble out it was so ludicrous to see mother perched up in the wagon with hardly room enough to sit upright a most perplexed expression on her face as she thought of her sleeping apartment miss mary and i climed up at the peril of our lives and climbed down with difficulty we all concluded amidst shouts of laughter that the wagon would not do and mother oh if your father was here he could fix it well poor willie pulled out the mattresses again laid carpets down on down on the grass and the mattresses on them made up the beds stretched a carpet over it all and at last mother miss mary and i crept in all completely dressed and with george between miss mary and i and john between mother and i we lay down weary enough we thought to sleep anywhere but we soon found our mistake willie and dr duvall divided the night into two watches each of them assisted by some old and trusty negro the oxen were continually getting loose and the mules fighting and getting away i could not sleep in my corsets and had to loose them i waked a thousand times during the night and would lie for a long time listening to the various strange and some of them funny sounds around the camp about one o'clock when willie's watch had commenced we heard all at once the welcome but most unexpected exclamation pa is that you it was sure enough oh how glad we were he soon crept in to our large bed and then we felt secure the wagon came up about an hour after this morning i crept out from my bed fastened up my dress and went to the fire to warm pretty soon all followed father and willie looked pale and tired and so did mother but the rest of us did very well john seems to have fattened since we left home he cried and struggled when first put into the carriage but since then i have not heard him cry once poor little george looks pale but i must hasten on our toilet this morning was ludicrous my first care was to secure my basket get my comb and brush and sit down by the fire to comb my hair which had not been loosed since the previous morning i then procured a bason of water washed my face and hands then rinsed my mouth and felt quite comfortable we did not got started till late the ox wagons went first and started nearly an hour ahead miss mary and i went first of our suite we had a delightful ride we soon got into the real swamp the road was narrow black and as hard and polished as a pavement on each side we looked into the beautiful green woods sparkling with the heavy dew and the sun just risen above the horizon shone slanting through lighting up the green which i thought the freshest and most beautiful i ever beheld miss mary and i were continually calling each other's attention to some loaning tree or son place where the am shone in long streamers over the brilliant green grass mollie and railroad were both fresh and spirited railroad was unusually so and miss mary felt rather timid on him mollie's lameness has entirely disappeared i thought her a little stiff this morning and had her rubbed with the oil of spike which i brought along in my basket but we had not ridden thus pleasantly more then two or three miles before we overtook the ox wagons the hindermost one had stopped and there were antony joe uncle levi and several other negroes gathered round the wheel consulting and shaking their heads what's the matter was my first thought my first word my wagon is broke down said antony the carriage was close behind and as it drove up they all seemed relieved call mass william all said poor mass william father was troubled indeed when he examined the wheel and saw that it needed filling but he said it might last to la fourche and sure enough it did miss mary and i rode on and told willie to halt the wagons here and here we arrived about ten o'clock we found an old almost impassable bridge but succeeded in getting all the wagons over except antony's they are all camped on this side on the bank of the sluggish muddy stream oxen and mules tied separately to tress all around and cooking going on around half a dozen different fires our kitchen is established near the carriage just behind me the carriage looks so funny behind there is a cake box with doughnuts and et ceteras tied on behind wreathed with red peppers and just on the other side is a box with mother's grand duke jessamine a cutting from my valeria and several heliotrope and cactus cuttings and one little violet all living finely i hope they will get to georgia i am sitting on a nice log with a tree for my back which shaded me nicely when i first sat down but the sun is now creeping round on my book just opposite on the other side the bayou is the work shop established under the shade of a large and beautiful tree sandy alonzo mark levi and several assistants are at work father is superintending and more often lending a hand mr duvall sitting on a log his hands clasped over his knees looking on willie has gone with a wagon and hands for corn at the back of the camp there seems to be great hilarity for joyous tones mingled with the loud guffaw come to my ears and a little while ago the merry sound of a fiddle was heard these are the poor persecuted african brethren this is our second camp here is lazy pete with two gar fish in his hands which he has just caught in a mud hold near by they look like alligators with the large mouths and feet like fins and long pointed tail pete says they taste like any other fish boil em and fry em and bake em but i don't think i should like to taste one evening we are still in camp father says he don't think we can leave until ten o'clock in the morning i have just returned from a delightful gallop of several miles miss mary and i had just returned from a ramble in the beautiful woods around and willie was about starting off for corn i asked him where he was going and he asked me if i wanted to go i was glad of the opportunity and ordered mack my hostler to get mollie in a hurry we had a delightful ride such beautiful trees no wonder the swampers love the swamp but i love my hills thursday morning sept 24th i was glad to see the dawning of the light this morning last night we passed most miserably in the first place loring had a chill just at dark and went to bed with fever we were all comfortably established in our tent which was nicely fixed up and were just going to sleep when we were disturbed by a disagreement between eva and lory he wanted the windows open to get air and she was certain she would take cold if they were we pitied them both poor lory was groaning with fever and at last persuaded him to take a place between georgie and miss mary at last we got quiet again the camp was perfectly still and until between one and two o'clock we did very well but then our trouble commenced father woke up with a severe pain in his back which he mistook for rheumatism but he soon found his mistake it grew worse and worse and thinking it might be flatulent colic for it had come round gradually to his stomach father took some peppermint it did not relieve him and mother had the fire rekindled some water warmed and prepared to use an injection but found on trial that the syringe was almost useless some time before we left home our little mischief john had taken it all apart and lost some little pieces it however gave father some little relief from the excruciating pain he then took some oil and afterwards an emetic he suffered for two or three hours thus terribly and then being relieved went to sleep it was then not far from dawn and he slept sweetly several hours i cannot express our agony during that brief time in which father could not suppress his groans i believe he and mother both thought his life in danger mother feared he had inflammation of the bowels oh how glad i would have been to have had the advice of even the slow calm dr whyte i could do nothing but pray in agony when father woke up he felt very much better and went over to direct sandy and lonzo about the wheel which is now 9 o'clock nearly finished father only took a cup of coffee and some buttered biscuit for breakfast and a little while after the pain commenced to return mother immediately gave him some peppermint he threw off some wind from his stomach and was relieved at once we think it must have been colic i know from experience what a terrible pain that is but i cannot think why it should have commenced in the back cuffy the old negro doctor says it was caused from drinking this water and i have no doubt it was added to the great fatigue father had undergone for two days before oh i hope we will not break down again father says we have the wagons too heavily loaded mother had john undressed and washed and his night gown put on last night he was so well in such a great glee that he would not go to sleep but ran out from the tent constantly he took a severe cold and we were uneasy about him last night this morning he is as full of spirits and mischief as ever this bayou or lake water to so sickly it makes me feel sick to look at it the beautiful beautiful woods and this black rich earth are the dwelling place of malaria the air last night was heavy with dampness and i seemed to breathe an atmosphere laden with pestilence and death it is indeed so the poor man from whom willie bought corn yesterday has in his family a proof of it we found him sitting under a tree dressed in the cloth called lowells pants and shirt only which had once been white but were dirty and all raveled and worn round the edges bare head and feet one leg of his pants rolled up almost to the knee he had a most folorn air of dress and posture but his face had something of brightness in it as the setting sun fell on his red hair and thin red beard two little boys his children were near one georgie's size red haired and freckled face looked tolerably well the father said he had not had the fever but one day this year the other a few years older looked badly indeed his face and poor little bony arms were yellow as saffron and the thick fringe of black hair cut square round his forehead made his complexion look sicker and more sallow still the father said his family were never all well at once he said he supposed we were moving to a healthier country this was the onhealthiest in the world father has just had another paroxysm is easier now willie has fixed the syringe and they are trying what effect it will have i am afraid father's sickness is a more serious thing than colic father thinks of inflammation of the kidneys it is so strange that it should thus die away and return third camp boeuf river friday afternoon sept 25th just as i finished the last sentence of the above entry father put the tire on the new wheel and immediately the camp was full of the bustle of yoking and hitching the oxen harnessing the mules saddling horses and other arrangements for moving on the road for a few miles was i think through the most beautiful forest i ever beheld large grand trees hung with long waving gray moss and clear of undergrowth there is one tree i shall never forget just by the roadside it is a white oak whose giant trunk divided a few feet from the roads into two branches each as large as a large tree it's majestic branches were hung with moss it stands out clear in my mind now the noblest most majestic tree i ever saw for a mile the road was a beautiful avenue through this forest than immediately the character of the scene changed the large beautiful trees were still there but around their roots the palmetto grew thick one who has never seen it can have no conception of the effect the scene was tropical indeed from the forest we emerged into an open space covered thick with the glossy dark green fans of palmetto a few miles further from here we rode up to a house on a low hill a high one for this region for some water and coming down through the unshaded barren field road the green wall of the forest looked beautiful in my eyes as it must have done to the most critical there was no moss on the large live oak trees whose leaves shone and waved in the light they grew so thick that there was no space at all between willie discovered about two miles from the camp that the wheel of the north carolina wagon was nearly broken father had just set the tire and wedged some of the spokes the day before we learned that there was a blacksmith shop at boeuf river and willie said he thought the wheel would last to that place miss mary and i dropped behind with the carriage and buggy and rode on slowly we stopped and walked or lay under the trees several times to let the teams get further ahead oxen go so slowly father felt quite badly and had a slight return of the pain george had a chill soon after we started when we came to the boeuf the wheel was taken off and father prepared to fill it it was than about three o'clock in the afternoon the other wagons came down to the ford a mile from the shop the ford is very long not from the width of the river which is low now but we have to go some distance through the current to avoid the mud one wagon ran down in a ditch and delayed the crossing somewhat the teams did not all got into camp and get corn until after dark so that the breaking of the wheel was no delay when i had taken a piece of ham and biscuit and let mollie rest a few minutes i took one of the men and went down to see father i met prince between here and the ford who told me that father had had another attack of pain and was going to stay there all night i had already provided myself with the ginger and peppermint and mother had sent father a biscuit and when i heard this i turned back for a blanket mother said father must come home i rode very fast and was indeed relieved when i found father up and in the shop he consented to come to the camp to spend the night before he was ready to leave mother came down in the buggy she was too anxious about father to remain here he came home with her loring had taken a chill just as he reached our camping place and had had a very high fever but when we returned from the shop his fever had gone down he was not entirely clear of it through the night father suffered much all night he did not sleep more than half an hour altogether this morning mother sent for a physician he came said the calomel that father took early this morning by mr duvall's advice was quite right prescribed more calomel and a mustard plaster and would return this evening he has just left says that father will be able to travel by twelve o'clock tomorrow provided inflammation did not take place as yet there is no symptom of it loring and george took some calomel and blue mass last night mr duvall's prescription also and loring has taken quinine today neither of them has had a chill and are much better this evening father was too ill to travel today so we remained in camp with tent pitched father has not been sitting up at all has had only one paroxysm and has slept a good deal i hope he will be improved in the morning the doctor pronounced it a severe fit of constipation miss mary and i took a nice bath and toilet this morning we rode down to the shop where there are some people living carrying with us all the requisites for washing and dressing went up to the house and made the singular request that the lady would give us a room to dress in how strange a request it was it did seem so then but the more i think of it the more singular it seems to me what would i have thought if any one told me two months ago that i should have done it i should have laughed outright but the lady a very nice polite person did not seem to think it strange she gave us her only room and we felt so pleasant when our toilets were completed that i am very glad i happened to think of this mode of making them we had not undressed for three days and nights not since we left home a gentleman passed here this evening who had a slight acquaintance with mr duvall in this wise he got mired up near mr duvall's camp on the railroad once when father was there and they took him in camp and i suppose helped him out of the mire his name is bonjurin lives at or near lake st joseph he passed by a little way and then having recognized mr duvall who was sitting here rode back spoke to him mentioned their former meeting and asked him to tell father to bring his family to his house said he had plenty of house room though no other accommodation and he would assist us in any way he could said he thought we could cross very well he thought it would in his opinion take us about three nights to build a flat and cross said if father went to natchez and applied to the provost marshall yankee at that place as father had been advised to do that we would either get full permission to cross safe or else be forbidden entirely in which case we would be obliged to return home immediately it is a perilous alternative and hard to decide what to do it seems to me that if father is well it would be better to cross ourselves i hate to have anything to do with the yankees but my judgement is weak i know in this case and whatever father decides will be best i am so indolent and sleepy this evening i commenced this journal early in the afternoon and now it is growing dark we have a very nice pretty camping place large trees make it shady all day and the grass grows quite thick over the ground though just around our tent its getting a little dusty from being so constantly trodden over if it were earlier and i felt more in a writing mood i would describe the scene before me but as it is i have not the courage to attempt it an observer of human nature would find much entertainment in studying this motly assemblage of natural people some day must note a few most prominent characters let us wait till we cross the mississippi the rubicon which is to be the trial of their fidelity forth camp near bogue chitto big creek saturday afternoon sept 26th glad was i this morning when the doctor came and pronounced father well enough to move and the order was given to prepare immediately all was soon ready and when we were once more in line a kind of exhilaration was felt throughout the train father did not sleep very well last night end mother was up with him a great deal but i knew nothing of it exhausted by the two previous sleepless nights i slept almost as soon as i lay down and did not wake once mother aroused me about midnight to cover george i was so sleepy i got up and looked for the little fellow but he was no where to be seen my little darling i said alarmed where are you just then my eyes fell on his head he had thrown himself quite off the mattress and his feet were outside the tent father has had no return of the pain today but feels weak i am not feeling so bright and energetic as i did a few days since i suppose it is the fatigue and then i think the languor of the past summer is working itself off and must be accompanied by some bad feelings my face is full of little pimples and there is a fever blister on my lips when i had the fever i cannot tell unless it were night before last when i felt quite warm we came on today ahead of the ox team and when we had come about eleven miles stopped at a house to get good water to drink the old gentleman was very kind and polite complimented mollie before she had been two minutes in the yard and so won my heart at once though i had been scolding her all the morning for being contrary it was half past ten when we arrived there father thought he would wait for the ox teams so we all went up on the piazza and sat down the old gentleman was very kind talked very pleasantly and told us that one of his neighbours a mr grayson brother of mrs fleming noble had recently been to natchez that the yankees received him very well and that he thinks they would cross father continues so unwell and our wagons are so very heavily loaded that i believe father has concluded to leave the lumber here and go to natchez to try and get permission to cross he will go first himself leaving us at some convenient point away from the river we remained at this old gentlemen's house his name is cole until past two o'clock father took a little nap on the piazza with his head on my saddle he refused a pillow then willie came up and father's first question was which wagon has broken down i expect he had been dreaming about it he was so anxious willie said none had broken down but a bolt in his wagon had broken and they had replaced it by a new one which he had along when willie came we immediately made ready and started after watering our mules and horses we came on to our camp here it is a very pretty nice camping place a level ground shaded by a perfect grove of large trees most of them oaks i am seated on the root of one of these large trees on my right hand is the carriage a little behind and further off mollie and railroad are tied on my left the carolina wagon and ambulance are drawn up with some mules eating from a trough and beyond on every side the ox wagons are drawn up in a semi circle with the oxen tied and comfortably eating poor mollie and her companion are the only ones unfed and here comes uncle jim with a tub of corn for them i know how welcome it is hear her low glad neigh and now the crunching of the corn i am just as hungry as i can be have not eaten a morsel since breakfast and begin to grow faint alice is hastening to prepare our supper oh here is mack bending under a load of fodder for our horses i was just thinking of a lecture for him about not bringing the corn himself but i judged him harshly he is a good simple fellow comes from the georgia low country and talks that strange dialect he is just like a child actually plays with dolls always has a grin on his face when we look or smile at him he knows but little about horses but is trying to learn and is really improved in front of my seat is quite a tableau vivant there is the provision chest which serves us for a table and around it are gathered continually shifting figures mother is permanent she sits in her rocking chair the same one she had at home giving orders and receiving reports eva now occupies the other rocking chair and loring one of our old country chairs george and john are standing near with some potatoes and father not far off directing about the tent there is willie with a bottle of wine in his hand he has been up to the house yonder to get milk and food for the horses and found out they had home made grape wine for two dollars a bottle mother has tasted it and found it good pure grape juice she says we have found a treasure had better get a dozen bottles but now she says oh i was just in fun but i have just tasted it and think it very good though it leaves a taste like persimmons in my mouth and mr duvall who has just come up says oh yes it is very good mr duvall always finds everything quite good i believe i am too hungry to write any more i am so glad that neither lory nor george have had a chill today mother gave them some quinine this morning loring is quite well with the exception of fever blisters but george still looks very badly though i think he is improving fifth camp bayou maçon sunday evening sept 27th sunday evening it really is and now it seems so as i sit down quietly in the hollows made by the roots of this gigantic tree looking sometimes into its boughs hung with grey moss spread out above me sometimes down the sloping bank where the level evening light shades through other venerable gray bearded trees to the calm clear river green with the reflection of the thick trees and vines of the opposite bank but this morning when we were starting and after we started i shame to say i actually forgot it it was indeed so unlike our quiet oakland sabbaths how differently our last sunday was spent i never rode horseback on sunday before in my life and seldom in the carriage when i did it was only to church but today we have made the longest journey we have since we started we have come sixteen miles at the least probably more i really feel tired we left camp as early as possible this morning and traveled without stopping for water or anything else until we reached winsboro quite a pretty little settlement with four or five white houses a rickety looking place with the large sign phoenix house swinging on a post in front a new dry goods store and a drug store and in the center of a small grassy common a large brick house with two stories and several chimneys which i suppose serves the double purpose of court house and church as mr duvall said he heard singing there as he passed we stopped under some large trees just this side of the town and rested there until the teams came up which was i think about two hours here i had time to read part of the morning service including the lessons i enjoyed it very much indeed when the teams came up we had some cold chicken and ham and biscuit which were very welcome to us hungry beings about one o'clock we started on and with the exception of once stopping for water we rode steadily and quite fast to this place osborne's ferry on the maçon i was glad indeed when we reached here and so was mollie poor little thing she was so thirsty the water at turtle creek where we stopped at dinner was so muddy that dainty lord railroad would not drink it at all it seems as if we cannot travel a single day without something breaking nothing is actually broken today that we know of but at dinner time there was one tire so nearly off that father doubted whether it would come here it will have to be set before we go further at the house where we stopped for water this afternoon we overtook a gentleman travelling to his home near here somewhere father asked him as usual about crossing the river he said he did not know much about it but referred him to mr murdock a nice correct gentleman who lived at st joseph's town and could tell us all about it now this mr murdock is the same who went by our camp at boeuf river with mr bonjurin and told mr duvall that if he could do anything to assist us we must call upon him so now we feel quite a right to do so having been recommended and then invited by himself how quiet is this still evening hour on the banks of the gently lapping stream it is refreshing to me travel worn and weary of dust and noise the ox teams have not yet come and the mule wagons are up on the top of the bank and make no noise to disturb us we passed some pines today how beautiful and familiar they looked there were several groups of them in one or two places but there were no hills everything flat the soil looked poor and as our road lay through the woods principally we had no means of judging of its productiveness after leaving winsboro the country was quite pretty though still perfectly level we passed several nice looking houses and the woods were very pretty already tinged with autumn hues bayou tensas sept 30th wednesday morning two days have passed by without my having recorded their events here but i think i shall have time this morning to give a full account we left bayou maçon about noon time monday having spent the morning in mending and setting the broken tire and fixing up another and in ferrying across the bayou which last was of itself quite an undertaking a few hundred yards from the bayou we came into the swamp as father informed us the great mississippi swamp at last from the macon to the tensas we came through it i never saw anything like it before i could have told at once that it was the swamp instead of gigantic trees clear of undergrowth that we saw in the la fourche the growth was thick and matted with vines everything was green except the trunks of the trees which in some places were covered with vines but were generally marked with fine black moss defining clearly the height of the overflow everything was rank luxuriance and looked more so under the damp murky clouds which hid the sky from our view and the soil such soil black perfectly black and in the deep ruts the mud was black till it was steell like and stiff as it could be the road was narrow and very bad one deep mud hole after another and large roots running entirely across the road in one place we came very near having a serious accident we were all very close together the buggy in front then the carriage and miss mary and i on horseback and close behind us the jersey with some of the negro women and uncle prince driving a loose branch lying in the road caught in loring's buggy wheel and this brought the whole cavalcade to a halt for the road was too narrow to admit of one vehicle passing another there was some trouble about getting the branch out and uncle prince's mules one of which was very spirited and could not bear to be behind grew restive and he could not hold it they dashed up and just escaped running on the carriage wheel father saved it by catching them in front and could hardly restrain them he took up a large stick and belaboured the wild one in the face before he could reduce it to any order as soon as he loosed it it dashed away and we all got into a terrible entanglement miss mary and i in front were making strenuous endeavours to get in the woods for the buggy was just ahead and uncle jim called out get out of my way while father and uncle prince were making frantic efforts to hold their mules behind and in the midst of all this two men rode up into the melee making it worse at last however the ambulance drove in front and we all followed quietly enough uncle jim displayed his skill in driving indeed the carriage would have certainly been broken but for his care and dexterity in going slowly over the roots and avoiding the mud holes and deep ruts whenever it was possible we came to one very bad place it was a deep hollow where in wet weather there is a torrent i suppose the hill looked almost perpendicular and uncle jim locked his wheel to drive down there father asked uncle jim did he think he could drive down there uncle jim leaning back on his seat answered composedly and confidently yes sir he was the personification of self complacency no emperor on his throne could have been more dignifiedly self important than this old black man with his grizzled hair and beard his sleves rolled up and the reins in his hand sitting firmly in his natural place and confident in his superiority as a carriage driver he verified his promise drove the carriage down safely mother and john got out though it was a terrible strain on the mules and harness as was the pull up on the other side not far on we met with another hollow something like this one at one place we caught a glimpse of a lake through the forest i rode in where i could see it better and never shall forget the scene a stillness as of death reigned over the green water covered for a large space near the land with the leaves of the water lily the cypress trees hanging over the water were draped with grey moss silent and still waved by no breath of passing breeze the low muddy shore prevented my approaching nearer and it looked to me like a glimpse of another world a world of perfect silence deathlike stillness entirely different from the character of luxuriant life which was only a few paces distant about four o'clock in the evening we saw through the woods a winding stream and caught father's remark to mother this is the tensas a little further and we saw the ferry and landing place opposite at first we thought of camping on the other side because we thought we would not have time to ferry over the ox teams before night but it looked so much like rain and mother was so much afraid that father would take cold that she thought it would be better to come over to this house just on the opposite bank where no one lives but the overseer and where we could get shelter and room to change our clothes soiled by so long a travel in the dust on the other side the maçon the flat was very small and we were obliged to unharness the mules from the carriages and waggons and ferry them over separately two soldiers and their horses and mollie and railroad went over first zulieka mollie's colt would not stay in the flat but when she saw it receding with her mother she was frantic to follow and plunged into the water i involuntarily cried out with afright when i saw her go down and commence to swim and as she several times plunged wildly i cried oh she is drowning she will be killed but she was soon safe across the narrow stream and as she emerged from the water my fear was turned to laughter she did look so ridiculous all wet and her tail hanging straight down behind the water dripping at every movement georgie showed no anxiety about his feluco but said he knew she would not drown poor little fellow his only care was to get something to eat we had none of us had anything since breakfast and george was almost famished as we were coming over the ferry he said pitifully thither mary ain't you got a little piece of bread and meat after walking up the steep bank on this side miss mary and i sat down on the roots of a large tree to see the carriage come over it was quite a picturesque scene before us there was the narrow stream the opposite banks covered with thick trees and vines down to the water's edge except at the landing place where the road wound up the high steep bank on the open place near the ferry the carriage and jersey stood and a number of negro women further up at the turn of the road where it was over arched with trees we saw the north carolina wagon with it's team of mules it's high green body and cloth cover while the flat was in the middle of the stream with it's load of people coming over we were soon forced by fatigue and hunger to come in the house and after eating some corn bread and ham i took my book and pencil and thought i would write some but felt too tired and after washing our little plants went into the room to change my dress the ox teams were not long in coming up and from them we learned the unwelcome intelligence that one wheel was broken the driver had run up against a tree in a very narrow part of the road and broken every spoke the damp murky evening soon darkened into night and with the first darkness the long threatened rain came down father came into the house while the others attended to the crossing of the teams all of them were ferried over that night except three including the broken one it was a gloomy night everything was confusion and wet the black earth moistened by the rain become sticky mud which it is almost impossible to scrape or stamp off the shoes after poor willie had got some supper and mr duvall had taken his in our one room which was at once bed sitting and eating room miss mary and i crept into bed with georgie and overcome with fatigue soon fell asleep but i did not sleep long before i was awakened by a dull pain in my side which increased to agony it gave me not a minutes rest for two hours i suppose when it lulled and i dozed a little while then it came on worse than before and i threw up the supper i had eaten this waked father and then mother they did everything they could think of i took peppermint laudanum and number six all without any effect on the terrible pain the worst i have ever known at last some hot water was procured to bathe my feet and the pain lulled for a few hours leaving a dreadful soreness and i was in constant terror lest it should come back it did come back about dawn and for several hours gave me no rest mother was alarmed and sent for the doctor living near here but by the time he came her remedies had procured relief and i was entirely free from pain he pronounced it an attack of colic said it was probably over but advised some laxative pills and sage tea which last i secretly determined i would not take i tried to take the pills in preserves and then in water but could not and chewed them up at last as poor little georgie did i was exhausted by my sleepless night of pain and slept or dozed throughout the dull rainy day without any return of the pain i am up this morning but feel weak and giddy ever since breakfast i have been writing stopping frequently to lean back and rest and smell the bay water by my side it is so refreshing mrs morancy gave me a great present when she sent me that little bottle full i am sitting out here on the back piazza with a wet cloud wrapped view all around on my left sally is washing by the cistern the only person near beyond is the garden and a field from the midst of which rises the tall white washed monument like chimney of the plantation gin and mills which used to surround it now they are burned down leaving only the chimney and a wreck of brick work and machinery to show where they stood beyond the field is girded by the green wall of woods where i can distinguish light green willows and the taller trees of oak and other woods for the space between us is quite narrow but in front there is a wide field where once luxurious crops of cotton whitened the soil which now produces a rank crop of high weeds the horizon is bounded by the woods which look distant and dusky through the misty rain falling between us overhead the clouds drift ceaselessly as one grey bank drifts away another follows showing no sign of clearing off the house and old rickety buildings around all look muddy and wet there is not a single bright feature in the scene this house has quite a nice appearance from the outside with it's white front and green blinds but within it is entirely unfinished unceiled and unpainted and has a damp sour smell but we are thankful indeed for the shelter it affords we should have been in sorrowful plight camped in the mud on the other side the bayou eva had had a chill since breakfast and is now in bed with the fever mr woods the overseer here says we are only twenty three miles from the mississippi would we were safe across out of this swamp which generates chill and fever just as naturally as it produces rich woods and abundant cotton crops and mud we hope to leave here tomorrow the wheel will be finished today it was almost done last night we shall then go about ten miles i suppose where there is fine plantation with shelter for our stock where we expect to remain until father goes forward and reconnoitres the ground i had almost forgot to say that mr burke and mr o'leary joined us monday morning at the maçon we were very glad to see them coming as they will be a great help in attending to the wagons and watching at night
friday sept 2nd 1864 i have been quite sick ever since i wrote last was very languid wednesday and lay on the couch all the morning but thought it was nothing more than the debility which so often prostrates me but in the evening i felt severe pain in my head and limbs which prevented my sleeping during the night thursday morning mother went up to consult the dr and as he thought my symptoms were typhoid in their character he came down immediately but it proved nothing serious i of course had to take the usual blue mass and calomel and quinine i had but very little fever suffered principally from pains in my limbs and great prostration of strength with an indifference to everything which seems astonishing in my nervous temperament yesterday was the first day i dressed though i went to ride wednesday evening i still feel quite weak and look extremely pale and more than usually ugly the weather is excessively warm the afternoons and early part of the night are scarcely tolerable but in the morning we have quite a pleasant breeze the sun is burning there is much sickness through the country as usual we have our share loring has had another slight attack of the chills and eva is taking quinine today to keep hers off she has had three mr barr and julia spent last night with us left this morning for homer mr barr came down last week mrs morancy has been very sick indeed and now has dreadful sore eyes how thankful i am she was spared to her family and friends her disease was very dangerous threatened conjestion of the bowels this has been such a very sickly season dr furness says the mortality in shreveport is very great as great comparatively as in new orleans in 1853 dr furness himself looks very badly took tea with us tuesday night before i was sick has been over since with his colleague dr melton miss mary thought the latter quite agreeable i am quite curious to see him monday sep 5th have really nothing particular to write this morning but have just finished writing to aunt mary and felt in a humour to keep on father and mother are gone to monroe today we are quite alone miss mary and eva are very busy the one sewing the other plaiting a palmetto hat they are again getting ready to go to homer mrs barr sent us word in a letter to julia that she would try and get the room fixed and hoped to have it done in a week or two i have quite recovered from my illness took a pleasant ride in the buggy with willie friday afternoon we went to mrs wynne's and called at mrs craig's on our way back found both mrs craig and margaret smiling after their hard day's work mrs craig says she will be ready to give margaret to me again as soon as she has finished weaving a piece of cloth she has ready for the loom they have to work very hard mrs craig and margaret have to spin and weave all the cloth the family wear and she has seven children besides her husband and herself they have no servant at all and mr craig is in the army this is but one of many such family's in the south once so rich and prosperous the weather continues just as warm as ever dr furness spent the evening with us friday he was over yesterday morning for something to read wednesday sep 7th our neighbourhood is full of soldiers several divisions came up from alexandria the other day and are still near monroe the sick are sent out to these hospitals except walker's division whose sick have gone up the river somewhere walker is transferred to the command of some department in texas the two hospitals are very much crowded but i believe there are only three dangerously ill poor fellows they are in want of many things i wish we could supply them the accommodations and provisions they have are both insufficient one of those who has been here from the first was over last night to get some bread we had had baked for him he said there was not room for all the men in the house but some were lying out under the trees just on their blankets it distresses us to think we can do nothing for them yesterday morning when they first came out mrs dortch heard they were without anything to eat and she sent over some light bread and soup they were exceedingly grateful the weather has not been so oppressively warm for the last two or three days the sky was a little cloudy last night i hope we shall have rain soon we are beginning to need it so many wagons passing on the road have made it quite dusty willie and i took a long horseback ride monday evening went to mrs bullock's on the arkansas road to carry a hat miss mary and i made some time ago for a little orphan boy she has i have seldom seen a more desolate looking country for a mile the road lay through continuous woods only here and there some deserted and ruined cabin after we came out on the public road it was perhaps more dreary for the houses were of the poorest sort far between often deserted and always ruinous with people as miserable looking and as scarce as their cabins we were quite tired when we reached our destination rode up a washed and gullied approach to a most miserable looking habitation a little have cultivated enclosure on one side a lot on the other in which stood a poor bay horse while outside under a tree languished a miserable claybank with his back all bloody a decrepit paling enclosed a little yard before the door where a few stunted altheas grew out of the hard ground the house was composed of two log pens with a passage between and a gallery in front on a little stool in this gallery mrs bullock sat carding while here two gals were near one spinning the other apparently just from the kitchen mrs bullock welcomed us cordially wanted to know what i had for the hat and was much obliged when i told here it was a present when we said it was late and we must go back why you ain't going home tonight won't you stay all night with us what an idea i was almost too much surprised to thank her as we returned home we met the most ragged and miserable looking man i ever saw his hair and beard seemed to have been guiltless of the razor for months and his eyes gleamed out wildly from his grizzled elf locks his shirt was very dirty and ragged up to the elbows and his pants were all ragged and tattered displaying his bare feet and legs he carried an old black hat in his hand this was mr bullock fit proprietor of such a place the only flourishing thing about his domain was an excellent field of corn our ride was longer than we had expected and yesterday i found myself perfectly lame and exhausted went to mrs dortch's in the evening felt better and after a good nights sleep am quite refreshed though not strong oh for health and strength will this priceless boon ever be mine i commenced the girondins the other day it has for me all the exciting interest of a novel i could scarcely tear myself away from it yesterday and am thinking of it all the time have nothing else particular to do now but read i long for the time to come when i can commence school again i am not strong enough yet and am afraid i shall not be able to commence until willie and miss mary and eva are gone we took our cloth out today are delighted with the success of our first piece it looks so even and strong we have received news of our daring and successful raid into memphis it makes me quite exultant is equal to the gallant exploits of the ancient knights we hear rumours that sherman has raised the siege of atlanta but nothing definite is yet known the yankees have lately made a raid into the swamp burned floyd the seat of justice of carroll parish and pinhook a little place near it we heard from one of the soldiers at the hospital that there was a capt collins sick in a private house in floyd whom the yankees took out of his bed and killed they also wounded two other sick men this is a horrid outrage if true as i dare say it is col harrisson is down there somewhere and we heard something of a fight he had had but have nothing but mere rumours thursday sep 8th have been so weak and sick today that i have kept my place on the couch nearly all the time reading the girondins in the intervals of my attacks of weakness i have a pain in my back nearly all the time cannot imagine whence it proceeds am tired of lying down and not well enough to read or sew and fly to my journal in despair i have a good deal to write too yesterday morning i was sitting in my large rocking chair propped back and listening to loring read when a carriage came up containing mrs proctor miss lawrence and miss laura barnes the motive of their visit was to get miss mary to take part in some tableaux and plays which the d.d.d's are to give a week from tomorrow for the purpose of buying the materials of a flag for the 17th regiment whose colours have been destroyed in some of their fights after some consultation we decided that it would only be a pleasure for miss mary to go and so we rode down to mrs dortch's in the afternoon to announce her decision spent the whole afternoon in discussions of costumes and parts miss mary is to have that of a housekeeper in a very pretty little play by miss edgeworth whose scene is laid at the time of the return of soldiers from the war the play is called the knapsack miss mary has quite a genius for acting and i expect will make quite a success we are going in town saturday to attend the first rehearsal i hope i shall feel better then have just discovered a fever blister on my lip which they say is a good sign dr furness was over last night i was really ill but not sleepy and when he came was reclining in a rocking chair in the parlour listening to miss mary's sweet voice she sang several songs before she discovered that he was on the piazza i begin to like him right well but have no reason for this change in my opinion and therefore do not know how long it may continue we have soldiers coming in constantly there were four here to dinner today besides a good many others before and since poor creatures we are glad to give them any pleasure in our power at most we can do but little for them i expect the soldiers sewing society will soon be started again in monroe dr furness says the quarter master at shreveport has plenty of cloth but can get no one to make it up and many of the soldiers are without clothing two came here today to get some washing done and two shirts made mother has taken both to do is engaged on the shirts this evening father is busy this evening warping another piece of cloth willie went to millhaven this evening had some personal business and in addition is going to bring back two cows for the hospital he is much better and will soon leave for his command father had commenced a pair of spurs for him we had a delightful and needed rain yesterday evening and there has just been a little shower how the leaves sparkle in the light of the declining sun it is so beautiful the atmosphere is much cooler i hope the summer heats are over it is almost time mrs dortch and mrs leighton were here today to bid us goodbye one of the hospitals is very near mrs leighton's and as they come over there constantly for water and other things she is afraid of disease and is going away this evening mrs dortch is quite alone as miss laura has gone on a visit to miss lawrence and she does not like to stay after mr leighton leaves so she is going over to her place tomorrow morning i am very sorry they are gone we shall miss them greatly and besides they might have been of assistance about the soldiers but they were both so unpleasantly situated they could not stay friday sep 16th i have been very sick since i wrote last had a chill last friday the first chill i ever had and i was so vexed and mortified i was in bed saturday sunday and monday and had a chill each day till the last i never remember suffering so much and my state of mind was very low and painful i am stronger now but my heart is like a deserted house in which the ghosts of the departed are walking always to and fro i am so lonesome willie has gone left yesterday morning it seems as if with him were gone all the vivacity of the house oh my brother my brother i miss him every hour father too is absent now left for shreveport wednesday he will only be gone a few days but it seems a long time we have just heard of the fall of atlanta but know no particulars this is indeed a great misfortune and we feel it deeply father had expected it but nevertheless it depressed him much we hope that hood has saved his army we have a young man staying with us now to recruit his health capt williams of the engineer corps he has improved very much since he came last saturday i like him very much is very quiet in his manners and spends most of his time in reading i feel too weak to take much interest in anything sit idle a great deal of the time am taking a preparation of iron by dr furness advice and hope it will improve my health there has lately been a sudden change in the weather yesterday morning on rising we found it almost cool enough for fires this morning it is the same the golden rod begins to blossom on the hillsides and a slight autumn tinge appears an the edges of the limbs this weather reminds me of that we had on our trip to georgia the crisp rustling breeze whispers to me of all the pleasant scenes in my life it brings to mind all my friends i have been taking a walk this morning exercise is essential to my health i am determined to walk every day hereafter the sky is so deeply blue the dark foliage of the pines defines itself so clearly against all the other trees glisten in the sunlight and every spear of grass and little flowering sprig is so full of beauty that a walk is a series of constantly recurring beauties but these beauties awaken only memories of other far remembered scenes and people that have vanished can i never free myself from this life in the past which from earliest childhood has so clung to me i do not try as i ought it is such a seducing pleasure though i know it is enervating and idle father received a letter from mr john green sunday he was quite well i sent a letter to valeria by a gentleman going across the river directed it to selma at hazard oh may it only reach her and bring me the answer for which i hunger daily monday sep 19th father surprised us early sunday morning we had not expected him until tomorrow were so glad to see him though he had only been gone three days i think his journey did him good his spirits are much better he met a gentleman who left macon georgia since the evacuation of atlanta he said that it was not considered a very serious loss to us and that it was there confidently expected that we should have peace in a few months i hope it may be so every body that comes from the east side of the river are in fine spirits they have not our inaction to depress them i have improved so much am well enough to take a walk every morning went more than two miles this morning and don't feel tired the weather is still cool and bracing my spirits mount with my health that dreadful and unaccustomed visitant ennui is quite gone our guest capt williams improved a great deal but took a little slip back yesterday i continue to like him though he vouchsafes very little conversation to me and that only when he can't help it i suppose he feels sick and cross though he does not show it i am determined to become acquainted with him with or against his will we have not heard from willie yet it is only four days since he left but it seems like weeks i miss him hourly saturday sep 24th 1864 this time last year we were on our journey to georgia this very morning a year ago we were in the beautiful but deadly lafourche swamp and father was suffering such severe pain as makes us shudder to look upon yet i look back upon this time with regret the accidents and troubles of our journey are softened by time and distance and the excitation of exercise and novelty and bright hopes stand out in fascinating colours when i look back upon the past year so full of uncertainties and trials of miserable doubts and impious repinings i am filled with thoughts so mingled and various that i that i cannot disentangle them i am thankful for the restored health which god has been pleased to vouchsafe me for the past week my strength and spirits have been better than i have rejoiced in for months no terrible morning weakness no miserable depression i have felt the blood flowing bright and clear in my veins captain williams left us wednesday morning for his command i sent a letter to willie by him we missed him very much the day he left but have gotten accustomed to his absence as easily as we got accustomed to his presence the day before he left he conversed more with us than ever before and i found him a most intelligent and interesting companion he had the sensible quality of not speaking unless he had something to say and so visible was this peculiarity that i felt no embarrasment in sitting for half an hour or more without any remark at all thursday evening dr furness came over i think i never saw or suffered so dull and sleepy a man in my life he appeared to be continually hammering his brain for something to say and after all did not succeed in striking any sparks he passed his hand over his forehead every now and then as if he had a bad headache indeed he looked like it and i think we were all relieved when he took his departure i have not yet had the pleasure of gratifying my curiosity by a sight of dr melton miss mary and i went into town thursday to attend a rehearsal of the tableaux miss hannah bry sent to request a seat in the carriage and when we arrived at major bry's we found we were also to have the pleasure of the company of a miss keene we bore our trials with exemplary fortitude i trust the dust was very great and the ferry troublesome to cross when we reached the rendezvous of the d d d's there were but two young ladies there and but one more came after waiting about an hour we left without doing anything and with the impression that there would be no tableaux at all we drove down to maj bry's with miss hannah called on miss lou hanna on our return and when i got to mrs stevens and met mary's affectionate welcome i felt like a weary mariner arriving at the long deferred port the rest of the day passed pleasantly and quickly mary was just recovered from an attack of the chills she looked quite badly we had an animated talk of some length about the soldiers who recently passed through here and about what mary had seen of them she actually had the honour of taking tea with gen prince polignac and walked some distance with him for escort she says his head just came to her shoulder and he is the ugliest little man she ever saw i had just heard similar description from capt williams we called at mrs dr mcguire's on our way out to borrow some books for mother i also got hervey's meditations have read but little in it yet but like that little very much am quite advanced in my girondins my interest seldom flags i read a great deal in it every day am now reading guy mannering aloud i find it interesting and entertaining as a novel of scott's could not fail to be the evenings are so cool now that we have to leave the piazza and sit in the parlour yesterday was warmer than it had been for the past week we had rain in the morning and also this morning early it was very much needed mother is in bed this morning with a bad headache father has gone to monroe father and i took a ride yesterday afternoon railroad was quite lively and i had a pleasant ride sent a note to willie this morning how i wish we could hear from him we hear rumours of skirmishes and fights up in arkansas but nothing definite we have heard no more from the east father is counting the days to the election in november he says if mcclellan is elected he thinks peace will follow may a merciful providence grant that lincoln that disgrace to humanity may not continue in power tuesday sep 27th yesterday morning father went to monroe and on his return gave me a letter from my dear valeria how i have wished for this letter now that i see it before me on my desk i can scarcely believe it has so recently left her hands oh how hard it is for me to realize the dreadful news which it contains mr ridgill is dead my beloved friend is fatherless what bitterness is not comprehended in that dreadful word my heart is full of sorrow for her her letter is very hurried she wrote at a venture not expecting that her letter would reach me how glad i am she wrote but oh how sad her letter is i wrote immediately on receiving it i could not
january 1st thursday 1863 1863 why i have hardly become accustomed to writing 62 yet where has this year gone with all its troubles and anxieties it is the shortest i ever spent 61 and 62 together would hardly seem three hundred and sixty five days to me well let time fly every hour brings us nearer our freedom and we are two years nearer peace now than we were when south carolina seceded that is one consolation i learn to my unspeakable grief that the state house is burned down sunday january 4th one just from baton rouge tells us that my presentiment about our house is verified yankees do inhabit it a yankee colonel and his wife they say they look strangely at home on our front gallery pacing up and down and a stranger and a yankee occupies our father's place at the table where he presided for thirty one years and the old lamp that lighted up so many eager laughing faces around the dear old table night after night that with its great beaming eye watched us one by one as we grew up and left our home that witnessed every parting and every meeting by which we sang read talked danced and made merry the lamp that hal asked for as soon as he beheld the glittering chandeliers of the new innovation gas the lamp that all agreed should go to me among other treasures and be cased in glass to commemorate the old days our old lamp has passed into the hands of strangers who neither know nor care for its history and mother's bed which with the table and father's little ebony stand alone remained uninjured belongs now to a yankee woman father prized his ebony table he said he meant to have a gold plate placed in its centre with an inscription and i meant to have it done myself when he died so soon after a yankee now sips his tea over it just where some beau or beauty of the days of charles ii may have rested a laced sleeve or dimpled arm 1 give the devil his due bless yankees for one thing they say they tried hard to save our state house from my sick bed this 15th day of january 1863 linwood thursday am i not glad to get another blank book on sunday my old one gave out to my unspeakable distress and i would have been désolée if i had not had three or four letters to answer as writing is my chief occupation during my tedious illness o that unfortunate trip to port hudson have i not cause to remember and regret it two months last sunday since i have been lying here a cripple and i am not yet able to take a step however on monday mother sent dr woods as my fourth physician and i have made up my mind that either he or nature will effect a cure before long wonder how it feels to walk it makes me weary to see others try it i always fear that the exertion must be very painful an absurd idea which i endeavor to keep to myself monday january 19th that blessed mr halsey like an angel of mercy sent me kate coventry yesterday just when i was pining for a bonne bouche of some kind i did not care what whether a stick of candy or an equally palatable book it is delightful to have one's wishes realized as soon as they are made i think it rather caused me to relent towards mr halsey i did not feel half so belligerent as i did just the sunday before at all events i felt well enough to go down in the evening when he called again though i had been too indisposed to do so on a previous occasion o sarah wheeled into the parlor there i beheld not my friend alone but several other individuals whose presence rather startled me i found myself undergoing the terrors of an introduction to a colonel locke and to my unspeakable surprise major buckner was claiming the privilege of shaking hands with me and colonel steadman was on the other side and was that mr halsey o never the mr halsey i knew was shockingly careless of his dress never had his hair smooth let his beard grow as it would and wore a most ferocious slouched hat this one had taken more than one look at the glass a thing i should have imagined the other incapable of doing he had bestowed the greatest care and attention on his dress had brought his beard within reasonable limits had combed his hair with the greatest precision and held lightly in one hand an elegant little cap that i am sure must be provokingly becoming why he was handsome ah ça some mistake surely i cried to myself my mr halsey was not certainly if it be i as i hope it may be i've a little dog at home who will surely know me i kept repeating i resolved to test the little dog's sagacity so i pretended to know this apparition and thanked him for the pleasure he had afforded me by sending me kate coventry he looked conscious and pleased the little dog had found out his identity i was more puzzled than ever how account for this wondrous change but metaphorphosed john talked he was expatiating at a most extraordinary rate and had been doing so for an hour after supper when gibbes drew his chair near me gibbes likes to hear what visitors say to his little sister whereupon timid mr halsey drew his slightly back and very soon after asked for his horse o gibbes you wretch what an amusing tête à tête you spoiled you innocent and the general of course only waited for his exit before beginning to tease me unmercifully i must put an end to this they shall not bring such unjust charges against him yet how am i to make them see reason night i am more pleased to night than i could well express i have been talking to an old and dear friend no other than will pinckney his arrival was as unexpected as it was agreeable the cry of here comes will pinckney sent me back to august 60 when the words were always the forerunner of fun and frolic he told me what he called his secrets of how he had been treated by the war department which has indeed behaved shockingly towards the colonel thursday 22d january what a rush of visitors last night one would imagine they had all come by appointment expressly to have an impromptu dance which they certainly enjoyed by the way there was little captain c the susceptible and simple who so innocently says i seen and i done it without the faintest suspicion of the peculiarity and looks so sweet and guileless and amiable and soft that i can't help wondering if he would be sticky if i touch him indeed i think his hands stick at least for when he told me good bye it was with the greatest difficulty that i extracted mine from his grasp he having forgotten to return it during a long farewell address and even when i succeeded in recovering it by being almost rude it was not released without a very sensible pressure from the putty or whatever it is that is so tenacious i am afraid it is rather a habit of his which has lost all force or meaning by being too frequently repeated then there was a horrid little wretch vulgar and underbred to my idea to whom i was introduced as mr g but here is lieutenant dupré whom i have not yet introduced though we have met before tall good looking a fine form and not a sparkling face i am inclined to believe that his chief merit lies in his legs certainly when he dances he puts his best foot forward and knows it too miriam who adores dancing is flirting openly with this divinity of the deux temps and polka and skims around with his arm about her position sanctified by the lively air lydia is dashing off on the piano with a grace and lightness only equaled by his own and lieutenant duggan with his good honest clever face which so unmistakably proclaims him tom we know already so no further description is needed captain fenner too is well known with his short though graceful figure his good humored intelligent face irresistible imperial and that roguish expression about that large mouth which displays such handsome teeth and seems to say don't trust me too far little captain c tells me a long story about how colonel steadman had come to him and asked if he believed it possible that miss morgan had put her life and happiness in the hands of a homeopathic physician how he considered her fate sealed and what a shame it was to trifle with such a sad affair at my age too ruined for life it was dreadful too sad hereupon as continuing the story he remarks that being asked his opinion by the colonel he agreed perfectly and thought with him it was an appalling sacrifice and oh all sorts of things anything just to make me miserable and unhappy well what is written will come to pass first comes a doctor with a butchering apparatus who cups and bleeds me unmercifully says i'll walk ten days after and exit enter another croton oil and strychnine pills that'll set me up in two weeks and exit enter a third sounds my bones and pinches them from my head to my heels tells of the probability of a splinter of bone knocked off my left hip the possibility of paralysis in the leg the certainty of a seriously injured spine and the necessity for the most violent counter irritants follow blisters which sicken even disinterested people to look at and a trifle of suffering which i come very near acknowledging to myself enter the fourth inhuman butchery wonder they did not kill you take three drops a day out of this tiny bottle and presto in two weeks you are walking a fifth in the character of a friend says my dear young lady if you do your case is hopeless what wonder that i am puzzled a wiser head would be confused i want to believe all but how is it possible what will be will be bon here comes a note from mr halsey ah ça lend him zaidee certainly here is a postscript three times the length of the note voyons will miss sarah make the annotations he requested in kate coventry he is anxious to have the lady's opinion on the questions of taste and propriety which so frequently occur in the book i'll not attempt such a display yet there are several passages i am dying to mark one in particular speaking of the peculiarities of men of how they are always more at ease when they have their hands employed drawing confidence and conversation from a paper knife and book to tumble a pair of scissors and a thread to snip or even from imbibing the head of a cane i am anxious to call his attention to if i dared add to the list or a cord and tassel to play with this nervous mr halsey is wearing out my pretty blue tassel that frank admires so much he says he can talk better when he dangles it think the hint might save it in the future friday night january 23d i am particularly happy to day for we have just heard from brother for the first time since last july and he is well and happy and wants us to come to him in new orleans so he can take care of us and no longer be so anxious for our safety if we only could to be sure the letter is from a gentleman who is just out of the city who says he writes at brother's earnest request still it is something to hear even indirectly one hundred and fifty dollars he encloses with the request that mother will draw for any amount she wishes dear brother money is the least thing we need first of all we are dying for want of a home if we could only see ours once more during this time we have heard incidentally of brother of his having taken the oath of allegiance which i am confident he did not do until butler's october decree of his being a prominent union man of his being a candidate for the federal congress and of his withdrawal and finally of his having gone to new york and washington from which places he only returned a few weeks since that is all we ever heard a very few people have been insolent enough to say to me your brother is as good a yankee as any my blood boils as i answer let him be president lincoln if he will and i would love him the same and so i would politics cannot come between me and my father's son what he thinks right is right for him though not for me if he is for the union it is because he believes it to be in the right and i honor him for acting from conviction rather than from dread of public opinion if he were to take up the sword against us to morrow miriam and i at least would say if he thinks it his duty he is right we will not forget he is our father's child and we will not from that sad day when the sun was setting for the first time on our father's grave when the great strong man sobbed in agony at the thought of what we had lost and taking us both on his lap put his arms around us and said dear little sisters don't cry i will be father and brother too now he has been both he respects our opinions we shall respect his i confess myself a rebel body and soul confess i glory in it am proud of being one would not forego the title for any other earthly one though none could regret the dismemberment of our old union more than i did at the time though i acknowledge that there never was a more unnecessary war than this in the beginning yet once in earnest from the secession of louisiana i date my change of sentiment i have never since then looked back forward forward is the cry and as the federal states sink each day in more appalling folly and disgrace i grow prouder still of my own country and rejoice that we can no longer be confounded with a nation which shows so little fortitude in calamity so little magnanimity in its hour of triumph yes i am glad we are two distinct tribes am proud of my country only wish i could fight in the ranks with our brave soldiers to prove my enthusiasm would think death mutilation glorious in such a cause cry war to all eternity before we submit but if i can't fight being unfortunately a woman which i now regret for the first time in my life at least i can help in other ways what fingers can do in knitting and sewing for them i have done with the most intense delight what words of encouragement and praise could accomplish i have tried on more than one bold soldier boy and not altogether in vain i have lost my home and all its dear contents for our southern rights have stood on its deserted hearthstone and looked at the ruin of all i loved without a murmur almost glad of the sacrifice if it would contribute its mite towards the salvation of the confederacy and so it did indirectly for the battle of baton rouge which made the yankees drunk with rage commit outrages in our homes that civilized indians would blush to perpetrate forced them to abandon the town as untenable whereby we were enabled to fortify port hudson here which now defies their strength true they have reoccupied our town that yankees live in our house but if our generals said burn the whole concern would i not put the torch to our home readily though i love its bare skeleton still indeed i would though i know what it is to be without one don't lilly and mother live in a wretched cabin in vile clinton while strangers rest under our father's roof yankees i owe you one for that well i boast myself rebel sing dixie shout southern rights pray for god's blessing on our cause without ceasing and would not live in this country if by any possible calamity we should be conquered i am only a woman and that is the way i feel brother may differ what then shall i respect love him less no god bless him union or secession he is always my dear dear brother and tortures could not make me change my opinion friday january 30th a whole week has passed since i opened this book a week certainly not spent in idleness if not a very interesting one for i have kept my room almost all the time leaving miriam and anna to entertain their guests alone even when mr halsey called on sunday i declined going down why i wonder i felt better than usual was in a splendid humor for talking yet my excuses took my place and i lay quietly in bed dreaming by the firelight and singing hymns to myself once in a while the thought would occur to me why don't i go down but it was always answered with a wry face and the hymn went on yet i knew he had come expecting to see me on the table near me stood a bunch of snowdrops that miriam had culled for her beloved captain bradford an idea struck me so suddenly that my voice died instantly the spirit of mischief had taken possession of me laughing to myself i caught them up drew three long bright hairs from my head they looked right gold y in the firelight and tied them around the flowers i thought i should never get to the end while wrapping them thus secured a servant carried them into the parlor with miss sarah's compliments to mr halsey poor miriam's cry of surprise at finding her flowers thus appropriated reached my ears and caused me to laugh again it was rather cool but then it was better fun than going down and then did n't it flatter his vanity o men you vain creatures a woman would receive a whole bunch of hair and forty thousand bouquets without having her head turned while you well i heard enough from miriam to amuse me at all events and a day or two after captain bradford had a long story to tell her what he called a good joke on mr halsey of how he had found him kissing three long bright hairs in rapture and on asking where he got them received as an answer from the god blessedest little angel that ever wore long hair this blessedest little angel did not intend it as a souvenir and is consequently annoyed about stories of three hairs intended as a string and nothing more being wrapped in tissue paper and treasured up so goes the tale instead of being thrown into the fire as i certainly expected last night anna and miriam sat on my bed at twilight playing cards while i tried my guitar when captain c major spratley and lieutenant dupré were announced quick down went the cards as they sprang to their feet to throw off their neat calicoes where was miriam's comb and grenadine and collar and belt good gracious where was her buckle on the bureau mantel washstand or under them please move a moment anna in such a hurry do there was anna wait i'm in a hurry too where is that pomatum you malvina if you don't help me i'll there take that miss now fly around malvina with a faint dingy pink suddenly brought out on her pale seagreen face did fly around while i hushing my guitar in the tumult watch each running over the other in silent amazement wondering if order can come out of such confusion and if the people downstairs were worth all that trouble when i finally made my appearance in the parlor it was with the conviction that i would have a dreadfully stupid time and captain c too however though at first i had both soon only the last was left me some one suggested calling the spirits which game i had imagined played out long ago and we derived a great deal of amusement from it six of us around a small table invoked them with the usual ceremony there was certainly no trick played every finger was above the board and all feet sufficiently far from the single leg to insure fair play every rap seemed to come exactly from the centre of the table and was painfully distinct though not loud when asked if there was a writing medium present it indicated captain c i observed that he seemed averse to trying it but yielded at length and took the pencil in his hand our first question of course was how long before peace nine months was written which foreign nation would recognize us first france then england in eight months who was miriam to marry captain of a battery who we all shouted captain c e fenner 1 was written again when in ten months i believe captain c to be honest about it he seemed to have no control over his hand and his arm trembled until it became exceedingly painful of course i do not actually believe in spiritualism but there is certainly something in it one cannot understand and mrs badger's experience is enough to convert one alone each was startled in turn by extraordinary revelations concerning themselves gibbes was to be transferred to the trans mississippi department 2 george would come home and all the gentlemen had the name and address of future sweethearts written in full the question was asked who will sarah morgan fall in love with every eye was on the pencil as a capital h was traced as the a followed i confess to a decided disgust at the spirits and was about to beg it might be discontinued when the rest followed rapidly until in three separate lines appeared has not seen him yet here came an exclamation of surprise from lydia and miriam who knew how true it was and even gibbes looked astonished captain in virginia captain charles lewis 1 a perfect buzz of comments followed every one asked every one else if they knew any one by that name and every one said no gibbes was decidedly more interested than i that odd has not seen him yet expressing so exactly the fact that i pride myself upon carried conviction in the truth of spirits almost who will she marry asked gibbes he has a pet belief in which i encourage him that i will never marry again came the name as distinctly as before of captain charles lewis when will she marry him in june 1864 was the answer i was to meet him in new orleans november followed after a period of course the spirits produced some slight commotion which made the time pass pleasantly until miriam began to waltz with her monsieur deux temps then captain c told me why he had been unwilling to try it of how his father believed so strongly in it that he had very nearly been made crazy by it and how he had sworn to abandon the practice of consulting them seeing the effect produced he did not believe in spirits himself but could not account for the influence he was under when he saw his hand involuntarily write things he was totally unconscious of himself however he proposed that we two should have a private consultation with them which i opened by asking when i should again see my home i know he did not know anything about it but on the paper appeared five months have gone five months more it is just five months since i did see home i think it was the 26th of august that charlie took me there he asked if he should ever marry never you will be jilted by the lady you love in missouri miss christina p i pointed it out to him as he happened to be looking at me when it was written it surprised him into saying why i'm engaged to her i asked whose spirit was communicating with us he was watching the dance when his hand wrote john c i laughed and asked if there was such a person pointing to the name he looked actually sick as he said yes my brother he is dead i had not the heart to talk of spirits again so we took to writing poetry together every alternate line falling to my lot it made an odd jingle the sentimental first line being turned to broad farce by my absurd second one
october 1st wednesday just after sunset yesterday anna and i were walking down the road towards the sugar house she reading occasionally from abbott's napoleon and then pausing for me to explain the very difficult passages she could not understand when we suddenly became aware of the approach of a horse and raising our bowed heads beheld colonel breaux and another before us to our infinite surprise and astonishment the colonel sprang from his horse and advanced on foot his companion slowly followed his example and was introduced as captain morrison we adjourned our historical fit for some future period and walked home with the gentlemen miriam did not get back from her excursion to the cane patch until it was quite late when after sitting down a few moments she ran upstairs to change her dress she had just put it on an hour before but nothing would do but she must dress up fine so she put on her handsomest organdie in vain i pointed to my simple pink muslin with a white body that i had worn all day and begged she would not make the contrast between us more striking than ever as i felt i could not change it without exciting remark she was obdurate dressed herself in gorgeous array and as usual i looked like her lady's maid colonel breaux paid my hair the most extravagant compliments he said he could not say his prayers for looking at it in church sunday before last perhaps that is the reason st paul said a woman should not worship in church with her head uncovered but as the yankees stole my bonnet i am reduced to wearing my black straw walking hat with its curled brim trimmed in black ribbon with golden sheaves of wheat two years ago this fall father threw me a banknote at table and i purchased this with it now it is my only headgear except a sunbonnet before leaving which was not until quite late this evening was named for our ride to the fortifications to our infinite delight as we have dreamed and talked of nothing else for a week a dispatch just received from gibbes from mobile on his way home i am so happy but what can bring him i fear lydia has gone to clinton to meet him at lilly's october 2d thursday with what extraordinary care we prepared for our ride yesterday one would have thought that some great event was about to take place but in spite of our long toilet we stood ready equipped almost an hour before colonel breaux arrived i was standing in a novel place upon the bannisters looking over the fields to see if he was coming and not seeing him made some impatient exclamation when lo he appeared before me having only been concealed by the wood pile and o my prophetic soul captain morrison was by his side there was quite a cavalcade of us mr carter and his wife mrs badger and mrs worley in two buggies the three boys who of course followed on horseback and the two gentlemen miriam anna and i riding also it was really a very pretty sight when captain morrison and i who took the lead going would reach the top of one of the steep hills and look down on the procession in the hollow below fortunately it was a very cloudy evening for starting at four it would have been very unpleasant to ride that distance with the sun in our faces as we reached the town we heard the loud report of two cannon which caused the elder ladies to halt and suggest the propriety of a return but if it was a gunboat that was the very thing i was anxious to see so we hurried on to the batteries it proved to be only practicing however at the first one we stopped at the crew of the arkansas were drilling after stopping a while there we followed the river to see the batteries below it was delightful to ride on the edge of a high bluff with the muddy mississippi below until you fancied what would be the probable sensation if the horse should plunge down into the waters then it ceased to be so pleasant the great strong animal i rode could have carried me over without a protest on my part for the ridiculous bit in his mouth was by no means suited to his strength and it would require a more powerful arm than mine to supply the deficiency miriam had generously sacrificed her own comfort to give him to me and rode fiery joe instead of her favorite but it was by no means a comfort to me then anna was not reconciled to her pony while i was on such a fine horse until i proposed an exchange and gladly dismounted near an old mill two miles and a half below port hudson as we returned home in leaving the town we lost sight of the buggies as there was no carriage road that might follow the bluff and though there was one just back we never saw our buggies again once following a crescent far below us lay the water battery concealed by the trees that grew by the water's edge looking from where we stood like quite a formidable precipice then still beyond after leaving the river we passed through a camp where the soldiers divided their attention equally between eating their supper and staring at us in the most profound silence then through an old gate down a steep hill past a long line of rifle pits a winding road and another camp where more men stared and cooked their supper we came to the last battery but one which lay so far below that it was too late to visit it we returned highly delighted with what we had seen and our pleasant ride it was late when we got back as altogether our ride had been some fifteen miles in length as soon as we could exchange our habits for our evening dresses we rejoined our guests at the supper table where none of us wanted for an appetite except poor captain morrison who could not be tempted by the dishes we so much relished after supper colonel breaux and i got into a discussion rather he talked while i listened with eyes and ears with all my soul what would i not give for such knowledge he knows everything and can express it all in the clearest purest language though he says he could not speak a word of english at fourteen the discussion commenced by some remark i made about physiognomy he took it up and passed on to phrenology in which he is no great believer from there he touched on the mind and i listened entranced to him presently he asserted that i possessed reasoning faculties which i fear me i very rudely denied you see every moment the painful conviction of my ignorance grew more painful still until it was most humiliating and i repelled it rather as a mockery he described for my benefit the process of reasoning the art of thinking i listened more attentively still resolving to profit by his words then he turned the conversation on quite another theme health was the subject he delicately alluded to my fragile appearance and spoke of the necessity of a strong constitution to sustain a vigorous mind if the mind prevailed over the weak body in its turn it became affected by decay and would eventually lose its powers it was applicable to all cases he did not mean that i was sickly but that my appearance bespoke one who had not been used to the exercise that was most necessary for me horseback rides walks fresh air were necessary to preserve health no man had greater disgust for a freckled face than he but a fair face could be preserved by the most ordinary precautions and even improved by such exercise he illustrated my case by showing the difference between the flower growing in the sunshine and that growing in a cellar father's own illustration and very words when he so often tried to impress on me the necessity of gaining a more robust frame than nature had bestowed and a letter he had made hal write me showing the danger of such neglect rose before me i forgot colonel breaux i remembered only the ardent desire of those two who seemed to speak to me through his lips it produced its effect i felt the guilt i had incurred by not making greater efforts to gain a more robust frame and putting on my sunbonnet as i arose from the breakfast table this morning i took my seat here on the wide balcony where i have remained seated on the floor ever since with a chair for a desk trying to drink an extra amount of fresh air i was sorry when colonel breaux arose to take his leave as he took my hand i said earnestly thank you for giving me something to think about he looked gratified made some pleasant remark and after talking a while longer said good night again and rode off while undressing miriam and i spoke of nothing else and when i lay down and looked in my own heart and saw my shocking ignorance and pitiful inferiority so painfully evident even to my own eyes i actually cried why was i denied the education that would enable me to be the equal of such a man as colonel breaux and the others he says the woman's mind is the same as the man's originally it is only education that creates the difference why was i denied that education who is to blame have i exerted fully the natural desire to know that is implanted in all hearts have i done myself injustice in my self taught ignorance or has injustice been done to me where is the fault i cried have i labored to improve the few opportunities thrown in my path to the best of my ability answer for yourself with the exception of ten short months at school where you learned nothing except arithmetic you have been your own teacher your own scholar all your life after you were taught by mother the elements of reading and writing give an account of your charge what do you know nothing except that i am a fool and i buried my face in the sheet i did not like even the darkness to see me in my humiliation october 4th saturday while anna and miriam went out riding last evening just as i put down my pen i went out for a solitary walk down the road that gibbes would have to pass but saw nothing of the carriage when i got back they told me he was wounded my fears were well founded then with what anxiety we waited for his coming it would be impossible to describe every wagon rattling through the fields made us stop and listen every canestalk waving in the moonlight brought us to our feet at last after supper far off in the clear light we saw the carriage i could not sit still i walked down the steps and stood under the tree in front followed by anna i did not like her to stand nearer the spot where it would stop than i even all the rest remained on the balcony we did not know how serious the wound might be we must be careful eugene carter advised caution for more reasons than one look out he cried suppose it should be colonel breaux then i am afraid the colonel will get a kiss i answered nervously shuffling from one foot to the other but suppose it is mr m he persisted oh thank you for the caution i will look carefully before i greet him i returned moving to the other side for nearer around the circle moved the carriage i heard his voice o gibbes where is it left shoulder mere scratch he answered the carriage stopped gibbes gibbes i cried my darling and he had his great strong arm around me the left was hanging in a sling slowly the others moved down the steps towards him what a meeting my heart was in my throat i was so happy every one caught the well hand and kissed him again and again and every one shrunk from that left side i had almost forgotten my gear lygia in my excitement we followed him on the balcony and put him in a chair near the steps i pulled off his hat and coat and knelt in front of him with my arm across his lap to get near enough miriam stood on the steps with his arm around her shoulder and lydia near the others stood around altogether it was a happy group that performed in the tableau of the soldier's return presently the negroes gathered too how is you mass gibbes in all imaginable keys and accents was heard while the captain shook hands with each and inquired into their own state of health but even wounded soldiers can eat so supper was again prepared i am afraid it gave me too much pleasure to cut up his food it was very agreeable to butter his cornbread carve his mutton and spread his preserves but i doubt whether it could be so pleasant to a strong man accustomed to do such small services for himself we listened to him talk but though it was evident from his slow deliberate speech so different from his ordinary habit that he was suffering yet i felt impatient when he was interrupted by any commonplace observation by one of us i wanted to learn something of his exploits much knowledge i obtained he was wounded at sharpsburg on the 17th september at nine in the morning that is all the information i got concerning himself one would imagine that the seventeen months that have elapsed since we last met had been passed in a prolonged picnic concerning others he was quite communicative father hubert told him he had seen george in the battle and he had come out safe gibbes did not even know that he was in it until then our army having accomplished its object recrossed the potomac after what was decidedly a drawn battle both sides suffered severely hardly an officer on either side escaped unhurt mr mcgimsey is wounded and major herron reported killed i expect the list will contain the names of many friends when it comes i have just come from seeing gibbes's wound dressed if that is a scratch heaven defend me from wounds a minié ball struck his left shoulder strap which caused it to glance thereby saving the bone just above in the fleshy part it tore the flesh off in a strip three inches and a half by two such a great raw green pulpy wound bound around by a heavy red ridge of flesh mrs badger who dressed it turned sick miriam turned away groaning servants exclaimed with horror it was the first experience of any except mrs badger in wounds i wanted to try my nerves so i held the towel around his body and kept the flies off while it was being washed he talked all the time ridiculing the groans of sympathy over a scratch and oh how i loved him for his fortitude it is so offensive that the water trickling on my dress has obliged me to change it october 6th last night i actually drew from gibbes the outlines of jackson's campaign he told me of some heroic deeds of his fellow soldiers but of his own not a word i have seen his name too often in the papers to believe that he has no deeds of his own to relate if he only would october 9th thursday it is astonishing what a quantity of fresh air has been consumed by me since i formed that wise resolution the supply must be largely increased to keep up with the demand perhaps that is the cause of all these clouds and showers i must be making a severe drain on the economy of heaven from breakfast to dinner i remain on the balcony and read aloud several chapters of the mémoires of dumas by way of practice a dictionary lies by me and i suffer no word to pass without a perfect definition then comes my french grammar which i study while knitting or sewing which takes very nearly until dinner time after that i do as i please either reading or talking until sunset when we can ride or walk the walk being always sweetened with sugar cane the evening we always spend on the balcony is that grand air enough o mon teint je serai joliment brune we three girls occupy the same room since gibbes's arrival and have ever so much fun and not half enough sleep i believe the other two complain of me as the cause but i plead not guilty i never was known to laugh aloud no matter how intense might have been my mirth it won't come as gibbes murmured last night while reading aloud artemus ward's last letter when we discovered it was suppressed laughter rather than suppressed pain that caused him to writhe so on the other hand anna and miriam laugh as loud and lustily as daughters of the titans if the respectable gentlemen had daughters i confess to doing more than half the talking but as to the laugh that follows not a bit last night i thought they would go wild and i too laughed myself into silent convulsions when i recited an early effusion of my poetic muse for their edification miriam made the bedstead prance fairly while anna's laugh sounded like a bull of bashan with his head in a bolster case saturday october 11th miriam went off to clinton before daylight yesterday with mr carter and mrs worley she would not let me go for fear mother should keep us at midnight they got back last night tired sleepy and half frozen for our first touch of cool weather came in a strong north wind in the evening which grew stronger and stronger through the night and they had worn only muslin dresses i shall never cease to regret that i did not go too miriam says mother is looking very sad sad and i am trying to forget all our troubles and am so happy here o mother how selfish it was to leave you i ask myself whether it were best to stay there where we would only be miserable without adding anything to your comfort or pleasure or to be here careless and happy while you are in that horrid hole so sad and lonesome according to my theory miriam would remind me that i say it is better to have three miserable persons than two happy ones whose happiness occasions the misery of the third that is my doctrine only in peculiar cases it cannot be applied to this one i say that if for example miriam and i should love the same person while that person loved only me rather than make her unhappy by seeing me marry him i would prefer making both him and myself miserable by remaining single she says fudge which means i suppose nonsense but our happiness here does not occasion mother's unhappiness she would rather see us enjoying ourselves here than moping there one proof is that she did not suggest our return she longs to get home but cannot leave poor lilly alone for charlie is in granada oh how willingly i would return to the old wreck of our home all its desolation could not be half so unendurable as clinton but lilly cannot be left poor lilly when i look at her sad young face my heart bleeds for her with five helpless little children to care for is she not to be pitied i think that such a charge in such dreadful days would kill me how patiently she bears it thursday october 16th it seems an age since i have opened this book how the time has passed since i have but a vague idea beyond that it has passed very pleasantly once since i have been with mrs badger to a mr powell who has started quite an extensive shoemaking establishment in the vain attempt to get something to cover my naked feet i am so much in need that i have been obliged to borrow lydia's shoes every time i have been out since she returned this was my second visit there and i have no greater satisfaction than i had at first he got my measure i got his promise and that is the end of it thus far his son a young man of about twenty four had the cap of his knee shot off at baton rouge ever since he has been iying on his couch unable to stand and the probability is that he will never stand again instead of going out to the manufactory mrs badger has each time stopped at the house to see his mother who by the way kissed me and called me sissie to my great amusement and there i have seen this poor young man he seems so patient and resigned that it is really edifying to be with him he is very communicative too and seems to enjoy company no matter if he does say her'n and his'n wonder why he doesn't say shisen too the girls are highly amused at the description i give of my new acquaintance but still more so at mrs badger's account of the friendship of this poor young cripple and his enjoyment of my visits of course it is only her own version as she is very fond of jokes of all kinds night before last lydia got playing the piano for me in the darkened parlor and the old tunes from her dear little fingers sent me off in a sea of dreams she too caught the vision and launched off in a well remembered quadrille the same scene flashed on us and at each note almost we would recall a little circumstance charming to us but unintelligible to anna who occupied the other side together we talked over the dramatis personæ mrs morgan jr in dark blue silk with black flounces a crimson chenille net on her black hair sits at the piano in her own parlor on the brussels carpet stands among others her majesty queen miriam in a lilac silk with bare neck and arms save for the protection afforded by a bertha of appliqué lace trimmed with pink ribbon with hair à la madonna and fastened low on her neck is she not handsome as she stands fronting the folding doors her hand in tall mr trezevant's just as she commences to dance with the tip of her black bottine just showing vis à vis stands pretty sophie with her large graceful mouth smiling and showing her pretty teeth to the best advantage a low neck and short sleeved green and white poplin is her dress while her black hair combed off from her forehead carelessly is caught by a comb at the back and falls in curls on her shoulders a prettier picture could not be wished for as she looks around with sparkling eyes eager for the dance to begin there stands calm dena in snuff colored silk looking so immeasurably the superior of her partner who i fancy rather feels that she is the better man of the two from his nervous way of shifting from one foot to the other without saying a word to her nettie in lilac and white stands by the mantel laughing undisguisedly at her partner rather than with him yet so good humoredly that he cannot take offense but rather laughs with her lackadaisical gertrude whose face is so perfect in the daytime looks pale and insipid by gaslight and timidly walks through the dance stout good natured minna smiles and laughs never quite completing a sentence partly from embarrassment partly because she hardly knows how but still so sweet and amiable that one cannot find fault with her for so trifling a misfortune at this point lydia suggests and sarah do you forget her i laugh how could i forget there she stands in a light blue silk checked in tiny squares with little flounces up to her knee her dress fits well and she wears very pretty sleeves and collar of appliqué lydia asks if that is all and how she looks the same old song i answer she is looking at miriam just now you would hardly notice her but certainly her hair is well combed that is all you can say for her who is she dancing with a youth fond of dreams futile ones at that i laughingly reply he must be relating one just now for there is a very perceptible curl on her upper lip and she is looking at him as though she thought she was the tallest lydia dashes off into a lively jig ladies to the right i cried she laughed too well knowing that that part of the dance was invariably repeated a dozen times at least she looked slyly up i am thinking of how many hands i saw squeezed she said i am afraid it did happen once or twice eighteen months ago what a change one who was prominent on such occasions mr sparks they tell me is dead may god have mercy on his soul in the name of jesus christ i did not ask even this revenge october 18th saturday last night mother arrived from clinton with gibbes and lydia who had gone there the day before to get her to go to baton rouge clinton october 19th sunday what an unexpected change i am surprised myself yesterday as the baton rouge party were about leaving miriam thought lilly would be lonesome alone here with her sick baby and decided that we should leave by the cars and stay with her until mother returned there was no time to lose so dressing in haste we persuaded anna to accompany us and in a few moments stood ready we walked down to the overseer's house to wait for the cars and passed the time most agreeably in eating sugar cane having brought a little negro expressly to cut it for us and carry our carpet bag three young ladies who expected to be gone from saturday until wednesday having but one carpet bag between them can it be credited but then we knew we had clothes here and depended upon them for supplies when we now find they are in the trunk and mother has the key we walked aboard alone in the crowded train and found ourselves in the only car reserved for ladies which was already filled with a large party returning from port hudson consisting of the fastest set of girls that i have seen for some time anna and i had to content ourselves with a seat on a small box between the benches while miriam was established on the only vacant one with a sick soldier lying at her feet the fast girls talked as loud as possible and laughed in a corresponding style in spite of the sick man they must have been on a picnic from the way they talked one in a short dress complained that she had not seen her sweetheart a pert little miss of thirteen cried you can bet your head i never went to any place where i did not see one of my sweethearts one of about seventeen a perfect beauty declared she would die of thirst so will i and i don't want to die before i get a husband exclaimed her vis à vis they evidently expected to produce an impression on us at every brilliant remark stupid understood they looked at us to see what we thought all of them sat with bare heads in the strong light an unfailing proof of la basse classe on steamers and cars every time my veil blew aside they made no difficulty about scanning my features as though they thought it might be agreeable i must confess i was equally impolite in regard to the beauty but then her loveliness was an excuse and my veil sheltered me besides while this young psyche was fascinating me with her perfect face and innocent expression one of her companions made a remark one that i dare say is made every day and that i never imagined could be turned into harm my beauty uttered a prolonged oh of horror and burst out laughing followed by all the others my disgust was unspeakable mock modesty is always evident a modest girl could not have noticed the catch the immodest on the lookout for such an opportunity was the only one who could have perceived it well after all no one can be perfect this may be the single stain on my beauty though i confess i would rather have any other failing than this almost putting this aside i hardly know which i was most amused by the giddy lively girls to my right or the two ladies to my left who were as cross and ill natured as two old cats and railed unmercifully at the silly creatures behind them and carried their spite so far as to refuse to drink because the conductor the husband of one of them gave the young ladies water before passing it to their two elders did n't the poor man get it she would n't taste a drop of that nasty dirty drippings that she would n't might have had the decency to attend to his kinsfolks before them creatures and why did n't he wait on those two young ladies behind her he did ask them well ask them again they must want some poor henpecked meekly passed the can again to be again civilly declined i confess the drippings were too much for me also though i did not give it as my excuse mrs hen recommenced her pecking poor mr hen at last surlily rejoined for heaven's sake don't make a fuss in the cars with an emphasis on the last word that showed he was accustomed to it at home at least with my veil down i leaned against the window and remembering colonel breaux's remarks two nights before concerning cross people i played his little philosopher for the remainder of the journey at sunset we walked in at lilly's gate and astonished her by standing before her as she sat alone with her poor sick little beatrice in her arms wednesday 22d october linwood we left clinton this morning and have just now arrived by the cars charlie came in last evening to our great surprise so we did not scruple to leave lilly the baton rouge party returned late this evening in spite of all preparation gibbes was horrified at the appearance of home friday october 24th a letter from jimmy the first we have received since new orleans fell it was dated the 10th inst and he spoke of being on the eve of running the blockade and going to liverpool to represent our unfortunate navy as he says though i am at loss to imagine what he can mean he speaks of a kind friend a mr george trenholm 1 whose kindness has been perfectly extraordinary he has befriended him in every way charlie has just come by the railroad bringing other letters from him to mother and lilly in mother's is his last good bye on the 12th again mr trenholm is the theme i could not help crying over my dear little brother's manly affectionate letter he says he is sure god will still care for him he has raised him up friends wherever he has been he says he lost all his clothing in going to charleston there among other kind people he met this gentleman who carried him to his house where he has kept him ever since treating him like his son and forced him to accept a magnificent outfit as a present from him he procured the appointment which sends jimmy abroad i wish jimmy had been more explicit concerning it we hardly know what it is or how long it will keep him the money he received to pay jimmy's passage received from the government he in turn obliged jimmy to accept as he sails in one of mr trenholm's steamers and not satisfied with that gives him carte blanche on his house in england to be filled up with any amount he chooses to name mother went back to clinton with charlie that evening to my great distress for she hates that odious place as much as i i know the life will kill her if it lasts six months longer how happy i would be if it were not for the thought of her uncomfortable position there lilly agrees with me that once out of it she never wishes to see the vile place again margret says that when the lord had finished all the world and all the people he had some scraps left and just thought he'd batch up clinton with them perhaps she is right sunday 26th october this place is completely overrun by soldiers passing and repassing friday night five stayed here last night two more and another has just gone one last night a bashful tennesseean had never tasted sugar cane we were sitting around a blazing fire enjoying it hugely when in answer to our repeated invitations to help himself he confessed he had never eaten it once instructed though he got on remarkably well and ate it in a civilized manner considering it was a first attempt everything points to a speedy attack on port hudson rumors reach us from new orleans of extensive preparations by land and water and of the determination to burn clinton as soon as they reach it in revenge for the looms that were carried from baton rouge there and which can soon be put in working order to supply our soldiers negroes and ourselves with necessary clothing of two evils if baton rouge is to be overrun by yankees and clinton burned i would rather await them at home
tuesday october 6th i hope this will be the last occasion on which i shall refer to the topic to which this unfortunate book seems to have been devoted but it gives me a grim pleasure to add a link to the broken chain of the curious story now and then maybe some day the missing links will be supplied me and then i can read the little humdrum romance of what might have been or what i m glad never was as easily as marie tells her rosary well the prisoners have gone at last to my unspeakable satisfaction day before yesterday they left now i can go out as i please without fear of meeting him face to face how odd that i should feel like a culprit but that is in accordance with my usual judgment and consistency friday i had a severe fright coming up camp street with ada after a ramble on canal we met two confederates everywhere that morning we had met gray coats but none that i recognized still without looking i saw through my eyelids as it were two hands timidly touch two gray caps as though the question may i had not yet been answered in vain i endeavored to meet their eyes or give the faintest token of greeting i was too frightened and embarrassed to speak and only by a desperate effort succeeded in bending my head in a doubtful bow that would have disgraced a dairy maid after we had passed then disgusted with myself i endeavored to be comforted with the idea that they had perhaps mistaken me for some one else that having known me at a time when i was unable to walk they could have no idea of my height and figure or walk so i reasoned turning down a side street lo at a respectable distance they were following we had occasion to go into a daguerreau salon while standing in the light two gray uniforms watching us from the dark recess at the door attracted my attention pointing them out to ada i hurried her past them downstairs to the street faster and faster we walked until at the corner i turned to look there they were again sauntering leisurely along we turned into another street mingled in the crowd and finally lost sight of them that fright lasted me an hour or two whose purse have i stolen that i am afraid to look these men in the face but what has this to do with what i meant to tell how loosely and disconnectedly my ideas run out with the ink from my pen i meant to say how sorry i am for my dear little lisper that she failed in her efforts to conquer the hero and here i have drifted off in a page of trash that does not concern her in the least well she did not succeed and whatever she told him was told in vain as far as she was concerned he was not to be caught what an extraordinary man dozens fighting for the preference and he in real or pretended ignorance i must do him the justice to say he is the most guileless as well as the most honest of mortals he told the mother of a rich and pretty daughter what he thought of me that my superior did not exist on earth and my equal he had never met ha ha this pathetic story makes me laugh in spite of myself is it excess of innocence or just a rôle he adopted stop his idle word is as good as an oath he could not pretend to what he did not believe he told her of his earnest and sincere admiration words words hurry on she asked how it was then here he confessed with a mixture of pride and penitence that he had written me letters which absolutely required answers and to which i had never deigned to reply by even a word that mortified beyond measure at my silent contempt he had tried every means of ascertaining the cause of my coldness but i had never vouchsafed an answer but had left him to feel the full force of my harsh treatment without one word of explanation that when he was paroled he had hoped that i would see him to tell him wherein he had forfeited my esteem but i had not invited him to call and mortified and repulsed as he had been it was impossible for him to call without my permission did my little lisper change the message when the little midshipman told her it had been intercepted because too friendly i know she met this martyred lion frequently after that and had many opportunities of telling him the simple truth but she evidently did not he has gone away with sorely wounded feelings to say nothing more for that i am sincerely sorry but i trust to his newly acquired freedom and his life of danger and excitement to make him forget the wrongs he believes himself to have suffered at my hands if it was all to be gone through again which thank heaven i will never be called upon to endure again i would follow brother's advice as implicitly then as i did before he is right and without seeing i believe they tell me of his altered looks and of his forced reckless gaiety which so strangely out of keeping with his natural character but makes his assumed part more conspicuous no matter he will recover nothing like a sea voyage for disorders of all kinds and we will never meet again that is another consolation notice the public are hereby informed through mrs chief manager of the theatre of high tragedy that miss sarah m having been proved unworthy and incompetent to play the rôle of ariadne said part will hereafter be filled by miss blank of blank street who plays it with a fidelity so true to nature that she could hardly be surpassed by the original
sunday november 2d yesterday was a day of novel sensations to me first came a letter from mother announcing her determination to return home and telling us to be ready next week poor mother she wrote drearily enough of the hardships we would be obliged to undergo in the dismantled house and of the new experience that lay before us but n importe i am ready to follow her to yankeeland or any other place she chooses to go it is selfish for me to be so happy here while she leads such a distasteful life in clinton in her postscript though she said she would wait a few days longer to see about the grand battle which is supposed to be impending so our stay will be indefinitely prolonged how thankful i am that we will really get back though i hardly believe it possible however it is too good to be believed the nightmare of a probable stay in clinton being removed i got in what the boys call a perfect gale and sang all my old songs with a greater relish than i have experienced for many a long month my heart was open to every one so forgiving and amiable did i feel that i went downstairs to see will carter i made him so angry last tuesday that he went home in a fit of sullen rage it seems that some time ago some one he said told him such a joke on me that he had laughed all night at it mortified beyond all expression at the thought of having had my name mentioned between two men i who have thus far fancied myself secure from all remarks good bad or indifferent of men i refused to have anything to say to him until he should either explain me the joke or in case it was not fit to be repeated to me until he apologized for the insult he took two minutes to make up a lie this was the joke he said our milkman had said that that sarah morgan was the proudest girl he ever saw that she walked the streets as though the earth was not good enough for her my milkman making his remarks i confess i was perfectly aghast with surprise and did not conceal my contempt for the remark or his authority either but one can't fight one's milkman i did not care for what he or any of that class could say i was surprised to find that they thought at all but i resented it as an insult as coming from mr carter until with tears in his eyes fairly and in all humility he swore that if it had been anything that could reflect on me in the slightest degree he would thrash the next man who mentioned my name i was not uneasy about a milkman's remarks so i let it pass after making him acknowledge that he had told me a falsehood concerning the remark which had been made but i kept my revenge i had but to cry milk in his hearing to make him turn crimson with rage at last he told me that the less i said on the subject the better it would be for me i could not agree milk i insisted was a delightful beverage i had always been under the impression that we owned a cow until he had informed me it was a milkman but was perfectly indifferent to the animal so i got the milk with some such allusion i could make him mad in an instant either a guilty conscience or the real joke grated harshly on him and i possessed the power of making it still worse tuesday i pressed it too far he was furious and all the family warned me that i was making a dangerous enemy yesterday he came back in a good humor and found me in unimpaired spirits i had not talked even of curds though i had given him several hard cuts on other subjects when an accident happened which frightened all malicious fun out of me we were about going out after cane and miriam had already pulled on one of her buckskin gloves dubbed old sweety from the quantity of cane juice they contain when mr carter slipped on its mate and held it tauntingly out to her she tapped it with a case knife she held when a stream of blood shot up through the glove a vein was cut and was bleeding profusely he laughed but panic seized the women some brought a basin some stood around i ran after cobwebs while helen carter held the vein and miriam stood in silent horror too frightened to move it was indeed alarming for no one seemed to know what to do and the blood flowed rapidly presently he turned a dreadful color and stopped laughing i brought a chair while the others thrust him into it his face grew more deathlike his mouth trembled his eyes rolled his head dropped i comprehended that these must be symptoms of fainting a phenomenon i had never beheld i rushed after water and lydia after cologne between us it passed away but for those few moments i thought it was all over with him and trembled for miriam presently he laughed again and said helen if i die take all my negroes and money and prosecute those two girls don't let them escape then seeing my long face he commenced teasing me don't ever pretend you don't care for me again here you have been unmerciful to me for months hurting more than this cut never sparing me once and the moment i get scratched it s o mr carter and you fly around like wild and wait on me in vain i represented that i would have done the same for his old lame dog and that i did not like him a bit better he would not believe it but persisted that i was a humbug and that i liked him in spite of my protestations as long as he was in danger of bleeding to death i let him have his way and frightened out of teasing spared him for the rest of the evening just at what would have been twilight but for the moonshine when he went home after the blood was stanched and the hand tightly bound a carriage drove up to the house and colonel allen was announced i can't say i was ever more disappointed i had fancied him tall handsome and elegant i had heard of him as a perfect fascinator a woman killer lo a wee little man is carried in in the arms of two others wounded in both legs at baton rouge he has never yet been able to stand he was accompanied by a mr bradford whose assiduous attentions and boundless admiration for the colonel struck me as unusual i had not observed him otherwise until the general whispered do you know that that is the brother of your old sweetheart though the appellation was by no means merited i recognized the one he meant brother to our mr bradford of eighteen months ago my astonishment was unbounded and alluded to it immediately he said it was so that his brother had often spoken to him of us and the pleasant evenings he had spent at home november 4th 1862 o what a glorious time we had yesterday first there were those two gentlemen to be entertained all day which was rather a stretch i confess so i stole away for a while then i got the sweetest letter from miss trenholm enclosing jimmy's photograph and she praised him so that i was in a damp state of happiness and flew around showing my picture to everybody mr bradford included who pronounced him a noble boy and admired him to my satisfaction then came a letter from lilly saying mother had decided to remain in clinton and wanted us to join her there o my prophetic soul my heart went below zero then colonel allen sent to port hudson for the band to serenade us and raised my spirits in anticipation of the treat while performing my toilet in the evening waller fowler arrived on his way to vicksburg bringing a letter to miriam from major drum heaven only knows how it got here such a dear kind letter dated 6th of august only affairs were very different then and he said that lavinia's distress about us was such that he must try to send her nearer to us and such an unexpected piece of news oh my heart fails me i cannot fancy lavinia a mother slowly i dressed myself and still more slowly i combed anna i could think of nothing else until i heard miriam and mr bradford call us to take a walk when we hurried down to them a race down to the railroad a merry talk standing on the track mingled with shouts of laughter in which i tried to drown fears for lavinia made the early sunset clouds pass away sooner than usual to us and moonlight warned us to return mrs worley passed us in her buggy coming to stay all night and half way a servant met us saying two soldiers had come to call on us once there i was surprised to find that one was frank enders the one i least expected to see the other was a mr harold i need not describe him beyond this slight indication of his style before half an hour was over he remarked to anna that i was a very handsome girl and addressed me as miss sally that is sufficient then will carter came in and joined our circle his first aside was if you only knew how much i liked you last night you would never be cruel to me again why i thought you the greatest girl in the world please let's part friends to night again i would not promise for i knew i would tease him yet and at supper when i insisted on his taking a glass of milk his face turned so red that mrs carter pinched my arm blue and refused to help me to preserves because i was making will mad but waller helped me and i drank my own milk to mr carter's health with my sweetest smile confound that milkman i wish he had cut his throat before i stumbled over him he exclaimed after tea but i had more amusing game than to make him angry then i wanted to laugh to get rid of the phantom that pursued me lavinia the evening passed off very pleasantly i think there were some eighteen of us in the parlor about ten the general went to the sugar house he commenced grinding yesterday and whispered to me to bring the young people down presently mr bradford and i succeeded in moving them and we three girls retired to change our pretty dresses for plain ones and get shawls and nuages for our warm week had suddenly passed away and it was quite cold out some of the gentlemen remarked that very few young ladies would have the courage to change pretty evening dresses for calico after appearing to such advantage many would prefer wearing such dresses however inappropriate to the sugar mill with his droll gravity gibbes answered oh our girls don't want to be stuck up there was quite a string of us as we straggled out in the beautiful moonlight with only mrs badger as an escort mr enders and i had a gay walk of it and when we all met at the furnace we stopped and warmed ourselves and had a laugh before going in inside it was lighted up with confederate gas in other words pine torches which shed a delightful light neither too much nor too little over the different rooms we tried each by turns the row of bubbling kettles with the dusky negroes bending over in the steam and lightly turning their paddles in the foamy syrup the whole under the influence of torchlight was very interesting but then mr enders and i found a place more pleasant still it was in the first purgery standing at the mouth of the shoot through which the liquid sugar runs into the car and taking the place of the car as soon as it was run off to the coolers each armed with a paddle scraped the colon up and had our own fun while eating then running along the little railroad to where the others stood in the second room over the vats and racing back again all together to eat sugar cane and cut up generally around our first pine torch we had really a gay time presently puss wants a corner was suggested and all flew up to the second staging under the cane carrier and by the engine such racing for corners such scuffles among the gentlemen such confusion among the girls when springing forward for a place we would find it already occupied all dignity was discarded we laughed and ran as loud and fast as any children and the general enjoyed our fun as much as we and encouraged us in our pranks waller surpassed himself mr bradford carried all by storm mr enders looked like a schoolboy on a frolic mr carter looked sullen and tried lazily not to mar the sport completely while mr harold looked timidly foolish and half afraid of our wild sport mrs badger laughed the general roared anna flew around like a balloon miriam fairly danced around with fun and frolic while i laughed so that it was an exertion to change corners then forfeits followed with the usual absurd formalities in which mr bradford sentenced himself unconsciously to ride a barrel miriam to make him a love speech going home mr enders to kiss my hand and i to make him mr enders a declaration which i instantly did in french whereby i suffered no inconvenience as miriam alone comprehended then came more sugar cane and talk in the purgery and we were horrified when mrs badger announced that it was twelve o'clock and gave orders to retire o the pleasant walk home then of course followed a last good night on the balcony while the two young men mounted their horses and frank enders vowed to slip off every time he had a chance and come out to see us then there was a grand proposition for a ride to port hudson on horseback and in order to secure a pledge that we would pass by general beale's headquarters mr enders wrapped my nuage around his throat declaring that i would be obliged to stop there for it though if prevented he would certainly be obliged to bring it back himself this morning however the married ladies made so much difficulty about who should go and how that we were forced to abandon it much as we would have enjoyed it i am afraid to say how late it was when we got to bed i know it was almost ten when we left the breakfast table this morning so i suppose it must have been quite late before we retired to colonel allen's as well as to our own great disappointment the band could not come on account of sickness november 6th we three girls fancied a walk last evening and immediately after dinner prepared to walk to mrs breaux's only a mile and get her to come to the sugar house but as we put on our bonnets captain bradford brother of the one who left in the morning was announced and our expedition had to be abandoned this is the third of the five brothers that i have met and if it were not for the peculiarity in their voices should say that there was not the most distant relationship existing between them this one is very handsome quiet and what dickens calls in a high shouldered state of deportment he looks like a moss covered stone wall a slumbering volcano a what you please so it suggests anything unexpected and dangerous to stumble over a man of indomitable will and intense feeling i am sure i should not like to rouse his temper or give him cause to hate me a trip to the sugar house followed as a matter of course and we showed him around and told him of the fun we had those two nights and taught him how to use a paddle like a christian we remained there until supper time when we adjourned to the house where we spent the remainder of the evening very pleasantly at least i suppose he found it so for it was ten o'clock before he left just now i was startled by a pistol shot threatening to shoot her mr carter playfully aimed miriam's pistol at her and before he could take fair aim one barrel went off the shot grazing her arm and passing through the armoir just behind of course there was great consternation those two seem doomed to kill each other she had played him the same trick before he swore that he would have killed himself with the other shot if she had been hurt but what good would that do her sunday november 9th i hardly know how these last days have passed i have an indistinct recollection of rides in cane wagons to the most distant field coming back perched on the top of the cane singing dye my petticoats to the great amusement of the general who followed on horseback anna and miriam comfortably reposing in corners were too busy to join in as their whole time and attention were entirely devoted to the consumption of cane it was only by singing rough impromptus on mr harold and captain bradford that i roused them from their task long enough to join in a chorus of forty thousand chinese i would not have changed my perch four mules and black driver for queen victoria's coach and six and to think old abe wants to deprive us of all that fun no more cotton sugar cane or rice no more old black aunties or uncles no more rides in mule teams no more songs in the cane field no more steaming kettles no more black faces and shining teeth around the furnace fires if lincoln could spend the grinding season on a plantation he would recall his proclamation as it is he has only proved himself a fool without injuring us why last evening i took old wilson's place at the bagasse shoot and kept the rollers free from cane until i had thrown down enough to fill several carts and had my hands as black as his what cruelty to slaves and black frank thinks me cruel too when he meets me with a patronizing grin and shows me the nicest vats of candy and peels cane for me oh very cruel and so does jules when he wipes the handle of his paddle on his apron to give mamselle a chance to skim the kettles and learn how to work yes and so do all the rest who meet us with a courtesy and howd'y young missus last night we girls sat on the wood just in front of the furnace rather miriam and anna did while i sat in their laps and with some twenty of all ages crowded around we sang away to their great amusement poor oppressed devils why did you not chunk us with the burning logs instead of looking happy and laughing like fools really some good old abolitionist is needed here to tell them how miserable they are can't mass abe spare a few to enlighten his brethren november 10th monday in spite of its being sunday no sooner was dinner concluded yesterday than we adjourned as usual to the sugar house to see how much damage we could do each took from a negro his long paddle and for more than half an hour skimmed the kettles industriously to the amazement of half a dozen strange soldiers who came to see the extraordinary process of sugar making at one time the two boys taking possession of the two other paddles not a negro was at the kettles but stood inspecting our work the hardest part we found to be discharging the batteries which none of us could do without their assistance we had no sooner relinquished our paddles than some one announced two gentlemen at the house while we were discussing the possibility of changing our dresses before being seen enter mr enders and gibbes morgan 1 of fenner's battery no retreat being possible we looked charmed and self possessed in spite of plain calicoes and sticky hands mr enders verv conveniently forgot to bring my nuage he says he started expressly to do so but reflecting that i might then have no inducement to pay that visit to port hudson he left it for another time we arranged a visit to gibbes and mr enders made me promise to call at general beale's headquarters for a pass they will want you to go to the provost marshal's for it but you just come to general beale's and send a courier for me and i will bring it myself and half in fun half in earnest i promised november 12th wednesday once more a cripple and consigned to my bed for how long heaven only knows this is written while in a horizontal position reposing on my right arm which is almost numb from having supported me for some sixteen hours without turning over let me see if i can remember how it happened last evening we started out to see gibbes just miriam and anna in one buggy and mrs badger and i in the other gibbes proper that is the captain and the general both approved but neither could accompany us it is useless to say how much i objected to going without a gentleman indeed when we reached the road which formed the fourth side of the square formed by colonel breaux's captain bradford's and captain fenner's camps i thought i should die of terror on finding myself in such a crowd of soldiers on parade my thick veil alone consoled me but i made a vow that i would not go through it again not if i never saw gibbes jr again on earth his camp lay far off from the road so that we had to drive out to it between the other two and asked a soldier to tell him that we were there presently he came up looking so pleased that i was almost glad that we had come and then captain fenner appeared looking charmed and lieutenant harris who looked more alarmed and timid than i captain fenner exerted himself to entertain us and seeing how frightened i was assured me that it was an everyday occurrence for young ladies to visit them in parties without gentlemen and that it was done all through the confederacy which however did not comfort me for the hundreds of eyes that were looking at us as our small party stood out in front of the encampment around a cannon i think he can throw more expression into his eyes than any one i ever saw miriam suggested sending gibbes to the provost to get our pass in order to avoid the crowd that might be there eager to leave the present one for a more retired spot i exclaimed oh no let us go ourselves we can't get in a worse crowd i meant a greater but captain fenner looked so comically at me that i could scarcely laugh out an apology while he laughed so that i am sure he did not listen to me what a comical mouth i liked him very much this time he promised to come out to day or to morrow and have a game of puss wants a corner in the sugar house but now i can't join in though it was to me the promise was made but to the catastrophe at once as we left we insisted on taking gibbes to get our pass and made him get into miriam's buggy where there was space for him to kneel and drive i was to carry out my promise to mr enders we had to pass just by the camp of the first alabama colonel steadman's where the whole regiment was on parade we had not gone thirty yards beyond them when a gun was discharged the horse instantly ran off i don't believe there could be two cooler individuals than mrs badger and i were i had every confidence in her being able to hold him so long as the bridle lasted i had heard that there was more danger in jumping at such moments than in remaining quiet so i sat still there was nothing to hold to as it was a no top or what i call a low neck buggy so my hands rested quietly in my lap presently i saw the left rein snap close to the horse's mouth i knew all was over then but did not utter a word death seemed inevitable and i thought it was as well to take it coolly the horse turned abruptly i felt that something impelled me out followed the impulse saw mrs badger's white cape fluttering above me received a blow on the extremity of my spine that i thought would kill me before i reached the ground landing however on my left hip and quietly reclining on my left elbow with my face to an upset buggy whose wheels spun around in empty air i heard a rush as of horses i saw men galloping up i would have given worlds to spring to my feet or even to see if they were exposed but found i could not move i had no more power over my limbs than if they were iron only the intense pain told me i was still alive i was perfectly conscious but unable to move my only wonder was why miriam who was in front did not come to me my arm was giving away dimly as through a haze or dream i saw a soldier bending over me trying to raise me the horse he had sprung from rushed up to his master and reared up over me i saw the iron hoofs shining above my body death was certain this time but i could not move he raised his arm and struck him and obedient to the blow the animal turned aside and let his feet fall without crushing me mrs carter when she heard it described offered a fabulous sum for a correct drawing of that most interesting tableau the gallant alabamian supporting a helpless form on one arm while he reined in a fiery charger with the other i was not aware of the romance i was conscious only of the unpleasant situation dozens crowded around and if i had been a girl for display here was an opportunity for thirty pair of soldier arms were stretched out to hold me no gibbes gibbes i whispered and had the satisfaction of being transferred from a stranger's to my cousin's arms gibbes trembled more than i but with both arms clasped around me held me up but for that i would have returned to my original horizontal position send for the doctor cried one a surgeon quick cried another tell them no i motioned i was conscious of a clatter of hoofs and cloud of dust one performed a feat never heard of before he brought a glass of water at full gallop which i instantly drained by way of acknowledgment i think i felt the unpleasant situation more than the pain not being accustomed to being the centre of attraction i was by no means pleased with the novel experience miriam held my hand and questioned me with a voice tremulous with fear and laughter anna convulsively sobbed or giggled some question i felt the ridiculous position as much as they laughing was agony but i had to do it to give them an excuse which they readily seized to give vent to their feelings and encouraged by seeing it several gold band officers joined in constantly endeavoring to apologize or check themselves with a really miss it may seem unfeeling but it is impossible the rest was lost in a gasp and a wrestle between politeness and the desire to laugh i don't know what i was thinking of but i certainly paid very little attention to what was going on i only wanted to get home away from all those eyes and my most earnest wish made me forget them the first remark i heard was my young alabamian crying it is the most beautiful somerset i ever saw indeed it could not be more gracefully done your feet did not show naïf but it was just what i wanted to know and dared not ask some one ran up and asked who was hurt and i heard another reply i am afraid the young lady is seriously injured only she won't acknowledge it it is worth while looking at her she is the coolest most dignified girl you ever saw and another was added to the already too numerous audience poor mrs badger having suffered only from torn clothing received very little sympathy while i got more than my share i really believe that the blow i received was from her two hundred and forty pound body though the alabamian declares he saw the overturning buggy strike me as i fell to her and others i am indebted for the repetition of many a remark that escaped me one bold soldier boy exclaimed madame we are all warriors but we can't equal that it is braver than any man i had to laugh occasionally to keep my spirits up but miriam ordered me to quit saying that i would go off in hysterics i had previously repeatedly declared to the doctor that i was not hurt and seeing him idle and hearing miriam's remark the alabamian i am told cried o doctor doctor can't you do something is she going to have hysterics really said the doctor the young lady objects to being examined but as far as i can judge she has no limbs broken everybody ordered me to confess at once my injury but how was i to inform a whole crowd that i had probably broken the tip of my backbone and could not possibly sit down so i adhered to my first affirmation and made no objection when they piled the cushions up and made gibbes put me down for i knew he must be tired i am told i remained there an hour i know they talked to me and that i answered but have not an idea of the subject a gentleman brought a buggy and offered to drive me home but a captain lenair insisted on running after the ambulance arrived there mr enders says he rushed in crying for god's sake general beale lend me the ambulance there is a dreadful accident and i am afraid the young lady will die coming back he exclaimed by jove boys if you want to see a sight run down and see her hair the prettiest auburn you ever looked at and sweeps the ground would n't mind such a fall if i had such hair to show come look at it do mr enders says he was sure that it was i as soon as hair was mentioned and started out as soon as he had finished a duty he had to perform my garter a purple silk ribbon lay in the centre of the ring by the respectful silence observed i saw they recognized its use so unwilling to leave such a relic behind i asked aloud for my ribbon whereupon anna says the officers pinched each other and smiled up came the ambulance and i was in imminent danger of being carried to it when with a desperate effort i regained my feet with gibbes's help and reached it without other assistance beyond i could do no more captain lenair got inside and several others lifted me up to him and i sank motionless on the floor all bade me good bye and my little alabamian assured me that he was proud of having been the first to assist me president miller whispered to mrs badger for permission to accompany us which she readily granted and raising me on the seat he insisted on putting his arm around me to hold me up it was useless to decline now miss morgan i assure you i am an old married man i know you are suffering let me have my way and the kind old gentleman held me so comfortably and broke the force of so many jolts that i was forced to submit and acknowledge that had it not been for him i could not have endured the rough road at the gate that leads to general beale's headquarters i saw half a dozen figures standing one was frank enders who hailed the driver hush said one i recognized as captain lenair the young lady is in there and the provost too i don't care if it is jeff davis i ll find out if she is hurt he answered miriam and anna recognized him as they followed behind us and called to him without more ado he jumped into their buggy finding them alone and drove them home he asked me something as he passed but i could not answer the road was dreadful once the driver mistook it and drove us within two steps of an embankment six feet high but discovered the mistake before the horses went over what i most dreaded was explanations when we should arrive miriam stepped out an instant before and i heard her telling the accident then everybody big and little white and black gathered around the ambulance the provost thought himself privileged to carry me gibbes insisted on trying it with his one arm when the general picked me up and landed me on the gallery he wanted me to lie down in old mrs carter's room but confident that once there i could not get up and feeling that perhaps the gentlemen would take advantage of its being on the ground floor to suggest calling on me i struggled upstairs with helen's assistance a dozen hands undressed me and laid me on my face in bed which position i have occupied up to the present 3 p.m unable to turn all night i lay awake iying on my face the least comfortable of positions but though the slightest motion tortured me i had to laugh as we talked it over of course this has been written in scratches and in my same position which will account for many blots this morning i was interrupted by mother's unexpected arrival she having come with dellie and morgan to spend the day of course she is horrified at the accident of that unfortunate sarah saturday november 15th i think i grow no better rapidly fortunately on wednesday night they succeeded in turning me over for my poor elbows having lost all their skin were completely used up now if i go slowly and carefully i can turn myself at the cost of some little suffering yesterday colonel steadman of the first alabama called with his father he sent me many messages of condolence and the rather unpleasant advice to be cupped and scarified his profession was that of a physician before he became colonel his surgeon whose name is madding told him he was satisfied that i was seriously injured though i had not complained the colonel is the same who called when we were in clinton they readily accepted our invitation to dinner and remained until late in the afternoon when captain bradford came in more messages of condolence and sympathy upstairs which produced no visible effect on my spine though very comforting to the spirit november 16th i was interrupted yesterday morning by mrs badger who wished to apply a few dry cups to my back to which i quietly submitted and was unable to move afterwards without pain as a reward for my patience but towards sunset came two dear letters that made me forget what i had suffered one from george and one from jimmy dated bermudas for the first time i know what my dear little brother suffered during those long months when we could not hear if he were dead or alive he kept the secret until he no longer needed either friends or money and now he tells it with a simplicity that made me cry fit to break my heart when i was left alone in the twilight with no one to see george comforts me with hopes of peace and a speedy return if it could only be this morning the boom of yankee guns reached my ears a sound i had hoped never to hear again it is only those poor devils i can afford to pity them in their fallen state banging away at some treasonable sugar houses that are disobedient enough to grind cane on the other side of the river i hear that one is at mrs cain's the sound made my heart throb what if the fight should come off before i can walk it takes three people to raise me whenever it is necessary for me to move i am worse than helpless tuesday november 18th a note just came from mother telling me that the most awful yankees were coming to burn linwood and take port hudson and so this evening i must walk down to the cars with a chair to rest in until they came and must certainly be in clinton to night delightful arrangement i wrote to ask if she knew that my legs were of no more service to me than to her dr dortch has again been murdering me says perhaps i can stand by sunday if the yankees come before friday night november 21st lying on my face as it were with my poor elbows for a support i try to pass away these lonely hours for with the exception of old mrs carter who is downstairs and the general who is elsewhere anna and i are the only white people on the place the cause of this heartless desertion is a grand display of tableaux vivants at jackson for the benefit of the soldiers hospital and of course it would be sinful to stay away particularly as anna is a great deal better and i need no care
monday november 9th another odd link of the old stale story has come to me all the way from new york a friend of mine who went on the same boat with the prisoners wrote to her mother to tell her that she had formed the acquaintance of the most charming fascinating gentleman among them no other than my once friend of course she would have been less than a woman if she had not gossiped when she discovered who he was so she sends me word that he told her he had been made to believe as long as he was on parole in new orleans that we were all unionists now and that brother would not allow a confederate to enter the house o my little lisper was i unjust to you he told her that i had been very kind to him when he was in prison and he would have forgotten the rest and gladly have called to thank me in person for the kindness he so gratefully remembered if i alone had been concerned but he felt he could not force himself unasked into my brother's house she told him how false it was sunday november 22d a report has just reached us that my poor dear gibbes has been taken prisoner along with the rest of hayes's brigade november 26th yes it is so if his own handwriting is any proof mr appleton has just sent brother a letter he had received from gibbes asking him to let brother know he was a prisoner and we have heard through some one else that he had been sent to sandusky brother has applied to have him paroled and sent here or even imprisoned here if he cannot be paroled monday november 30th our distress about gibbes has been somewhat relieved by good news from jimmy the jolliest sailor letter from him came this morning dated only the 4th instant from cherbourg detailing his cruise on the georgia from leaving england to bahia trinidad cape of good hope to france again such a bright dashing letter we laughed extravagantly over it when he told how they readily evaded the vanderbilt knowing she would knock them into pie how he and the french captain quarreled when he ordered him to show his papers and how he did not know french abuse enough to enter into competition with him so went back a first and second time to maury when the man would not let him come aboard whereupon maury brought the ship to with two or three shots and jimmy made a third attempt and forced the frenchman to show his papers he tells it in such a matter of fact way no extravagance no idea of having been in a dangerous situation he a boy of eighteen on a french ship in spite of the captain's rage what a jolly life it must be now dashing in storms and danger now floating in sunshine and fun wish i was a midshipman then how he changes in describing the prize with an assorted cargo that they took which contained all things from a needle to pianos from the reckless spurt in which he speaks of the plundering to where he tells of how the captain having died several days before was brought on the georgia while maury read the service over the body and consigned it to the deep by the flames of the dead man's own vessel what noble tender manly hearts it shows those rough seamen stopping in their work of destruction to perform the last rites over their dead enemy one can fancy their bare heads and sunburned faces standing in solemn silence around the poor dead man when he dropped into his immense grave god bless the pirates
november 2d 1864 this morning we heard jimmy is engaged to helen trenholm daughter of the secretary of the confederate states he wrote asking brother's consent saying they had been engaged since august though he had had no opportunity of writing until that day the middle of september i cried myself blind it seems that our last one is gone but this is the first selfish burst of feeling later i shall come to my senses and love my sister that is to be but my darling my darling o jimmy how can i give you up you have been so close to me since harry died alone now best so
thursday december 4th 1 it would be only the absurd tableaux i agreed to with plenty of fun and nothing more so i tried to be merry and content and so i should have been for there was plenty to talk about and every one was so solicitous for my comfort and there was mr enders who would wheel my chair for me wherever i wished it and was as kind and attentive as a brother surely my first trip should have been a gay one miriam sat down by the piano mr enders drew me by her and we three sang until dark together a mr morse his wife and mother who are spending a week here were our audience the first two retired at candle light while the latter present at the play the night before remained to the last but while we sang every noise at the parlor door caused us to turn with the apprehension of we hardly knew what a dozen times mr enders consulted his watch and telegraphed his fears to me though i persisted in thinking it only the fun that had been intended half past six came and with it mrs worley now she knew better for dr dortch had come to see me and was guiding me in my game of euchre in which i was not even as wise as my partner mr enders when her note came instantly we put down our cards while miriam begged him to write and tell her the true story he wrote and we all read it not only that but miriam added a post script which i think was this word for word mrs worley it is only a bet at cards intended as the merest joke there is not a word of truth in it and i will consider it the greatest favor if you will contradict the report whenever you may hear it explicit enough one would think but still she came and sent word into the parlor that one of the ladies present when will made the announcement had sent her contribution to the evening's fun it turned out to be a complete bridal suit worn by the lady a year ago that was too serious a jest miriam went into the other room to speak to mrs worley who cold as an icicle refused to receive or make explanation beyond i won't kiss you this is too cruel there was nothing to do she returned laughing but certainly feeling herself the injured one and so she was in fifteen minutes another stir i held my breath with expectation lydia introduced mr g ten miles he had ridden through mud and water that freezing evening at will carter's request to perform the ceremony between him and miriam lydia laughed until she could hardly introduce him he hat in hand bowed around the convulsed circle with a countenance shining with the most sublimely vacant expression o that man's idiotic face and solemn portentous look brought a writhe even to my trembling lips mr enders would have given one an excellent idea of the effect produced by a real old piney woods chill he shook as with suppressed laughter but when the tremendous preacher tremendous because composed of gigantic nothing turned his lugubrious face towards mrs morse and addressed her as mrs morgan under the impression that she had come down to see her daughter married miriam's risibles could no longer stand it and she flew from the room in time to avoid a disgraceful explosion i was growing frightened mr enders was leaning over my chair and involuntarily it burst from me with a groan for god's sake help me save her hush lie back in your chair i will he whispered but for the love of heaven save my sister i'll do what you will if you will only keep still and not hurt yourself i'll do my best it was all whispered that the minister and mrs morse might not hear if it were your sister what would you do my god i'd meet him on the front gallery and kick him out then i'd know one of us must die to morrow but under the circumstances it is impossible for gibbes to act i urged while we agreed that it was the most unwarrantable piece of insolence ever perpetrated while we talked gibbes had seized miriam and without interfering or advising further advised her to keep her room and not meet will but i skipped the most important part she came back when she had recovered her composure and sat by me mr enders when i asked what was best to do whispered that to spare will's feelings and avoid a most painful scene as well as to show that she had no serious intentions whatever she should see that the minister was put in full possession of the facts before it went any farther he felt keenly his unpleasant situation and it was only our earnest request that induced him to remain or give his advice who should explain certainly not the general he thought the joke carried too far and retired to his room before mr g came how take part against his own nephew not gibbes either for he had gone upstairs too worried and annoyed to talk to any one besides it was his wife's cousin who then miriam is one woman in a thousand rising she crossed the room slowly and as dignified as though she only meant to warm herself i think i see her before me now as she stood before the fire facing mr g looking so handsome and stylish in her black grenadine with the pale green trimming telling her story plainly earnestly distinctly without hurry or embarrassment in the neatest prettiest most admirable speech i ever heard she told everything just as it was bravo for miriam there lives not the woman in this state who could do so painful a thing in such a beautiful way i felt like hugging her oh it was magnificent he heard her in surprise but when once satisfied of its truth he said well miss morgan when you stand on the floor when i ask if you will it is your privilege to answer no miriam is not one to do so cruel a thing she is too noble to deceive him so far and wound him so cruelly before all when he believed himself so near happiness she said that it was mockery she would not suffer him to believe for an instant that she meant to marry him if he believed it he was deceiving himself wilfully for he already knew that she had told him it could never be he agreed to take it only as a jest promised that he would not feel hurt and with the most admirable tact miriam the trump i have been playing euchre excuse me settled the minister and the wedding by her splendid behavior with no trouble a rapid step was heard in the hall the bridegroom had come i know he must have killed his horse he certainly did not leave his house before one o'clock it is twenty miles by the road to clinton he went there procured his license and was here at seven in full costume he bounded upstairs to meet the bride elect i can fancy him going to clinton doubting fearing believing against all evidence yet trembling securing the license at last persuading himself that she would not dare refuse when the deeds were recorded in court and he held them in his hand and very few women would have been brave enough too he did not know my miriam i can fancy the poor horse lashed through the heavy mire tired foaming panting while his strong arm urged it on with whip and spur i can hear the exulting beating of his heart that wild refrain that was raging as his death knell mine mine at last i could hear it i say it rung in my ears all night he held her in his power she must be his hastily yet carefully he performs his toilet i dare say he stopped to think which cravat she liked best mine mine the song is ringing in every stroke of his throbbing breast mount mount two miles fly past he sweeps through the moonlight like death riding on a pale horse yonder shine lights in the parlor and that above is it hers he throws himself from his horse his hour has come hers too with the license and minister his own adoration and she must love him too he will win show him the way to her she is his forever now his my god had i not reason to cry in god's name save her frank he reaches mrs carter's room and triumphantly throws the license on her table he is ready now where is his bride some one meets him will the story is told she is not to be won by force she has appealed to the minister he has carried the jest too far the strong man reels he falls on the bed in his bridal array in agony too great for tears i dare not ask what followed they tell me it was awful what madness and folly to dream of forcing her to marry him why if she had loved him the high handed proceeding would have roused the lion of her spirit he is no mate for her he has but one thought and at last words come miriam miriam call her for the love of god one word one look oh she will take pity on him in his misery let her come for one instant she cannot be so cruel she will marry him if only to save him from death or worse and fortunate it was that he was not armed one of the two would have died perhaps both the heartbroken prayer goes on the exulting mine mine has changed to the groan of despair miriam for the love of god come to me and where is the bride gibbes has her caged in the next room this one where i am now lying he has advised her not to appear to go to bed and say no more sent to bed like a baby on her wedding night she says that she laughed aloud when the door closed on her she laughing in here he groaning in there it is to be hoped they each drowned the voice of the other the minister said good night he disclaimed all feeling of pique he felt chiefly for the young lady and the disappointed groom ouf i sent to ask will to come to me alone for a moment no he could not see me write to him slowly as though an aged infirm tottering man we heard him descending the steps how different from the step that carried him up we conscience stricken sat within with doors closed he was off he has again mounted his horse and the broken hearted man hardly less cruel than the expectant bridegroom dashes the rowel in his side and disappears like a whirlwind i can fancy mother's and lilly's agony when they hear of the wedding all clinton knew it last night and if they did too i know there was as little sleep for them as for us i know mother shrieked my child my child while lilly cried how could he believe she meant to marry him without even sending word to mother when he was going to the very town bah what a jolly go if those two got hysterics about the supposed moral suicide glad i was not at the tea party well fearing the effect of such a shock in mother's nervous state gibbes advised miriam to go on the cars this evening and convince her that it had not occurred court records and licenses and minister to the contrary notwithstanding so my duck my angel she whom i call my peri with the singed wings children who play in the fire must expect to be burned set off on her pious errand without the protecting arm of her bridegroom sunday 7th december i have had a shock while writing alone here almost all have gone to church i heard a step ascending the stair what i asked if it should be will then i blamed myself for supposing such a thing possible slowly it came nearer and nearer i raised my head and was greeted with a ghastly smile i held out my hand will sarah misery discards ceremony he stood before me the most woebegone heartbroken man i ever saw with a forced laugh he said where is my bride pshaw i know she has gone to clinton i have come to talk to you was n't it a merry wedding the hollow laugh rang again i tried to jest but failed sit down and let me talk to you i said he was in a wayward humor cut to the heart ready to submit to a touch of silk or to resist a grasp of iron this was the man i had to deal with and get from him something he clung to as to not his life but miriam and i know so little how to act in such a case know so little about dealing gently with wild natures he alarmed me at first his forced laugh ceased he said that he meant to keep that license always it was a joke on him yesterday but with that in his possession the tables would be turned on her he would show it to her occasionally it should keep her from marrying any one else i said that it would be demanded though he must deliver it the very devil shot in his eye as he exclaimed fiercely if any one dares demand it i'll die before giving it up if god almighty came i'd say no i'll die with it first o merciful father i thought what misery is to come of this jest he must relinquish it gibbes will force him into it or die in the attempt george would come from virginia jimmy would cross the seas and i was alone in here to deal with such a spirit i commenced gently would he do miriam such a wrong it was no wrong he said let him follow his own will you profess to love her i asked profess great god how can you i adore her i tell you that in spite of all this i love her not more that is impossible but as much as ever look at my face and ask that burst from him with the wildest impulse very well this girl you love then you mean to make miserable you stand forever between her and her happiness because you love her is this love he was sullenly silent i went on not only her happiness but her honor is concerned you who love her so do her this foul injury would it affect her reputation he asked ask yourself is it quite right that you should hold in your hands the evidence that she is mrs carter when you know she is not and never will be is it quite honorable in god's name would it injure miriam i'd rather die than grieve her my iron was melted but too hot to handle i put it on one side satisfied that i and i only had saved miriam from injury and three brothers from bloodshed by using his insane love as a lever it does not look as hard here as it was in reality but it was of the hardest struggles i ever had indeed it was desperate i had touched the right key and satisfied of success turned the subject to let him believe he was following his own suggestions when i told him he must free miriam from all blame that i had encouraged the jest against her repeated remonstrances and was alone to blame he generously took it on himself i was so crazy about her he said that i would have done it anyhow i would have run any risk for the faintest chance of obtaining her and much more to the same purpose that though very generous in him did not satisfy my conscience but he surprised me by saying that he was satisfied that if i had been in my room and he had walked into the parlor with the license she would have married him what infatuation he says though that i only prevented it that my influence by my mere presence is stronger than his words i don't say that is so but if i helped save her thank heaven it is impossible to say one half that passed but he showed me his determination to act just as he has heretofore and take it all as a joke that no blame might be attached to her besides i'd rather die than not see her i laugh but you don't know what i suffer poor fellow i saw it in his swimming eyes at last he got up to go before they returned from church beg her to meet me as she always has i told mrs worley that she must treat her just the same because i love her so and say i go to clinton to morrow to have that record effaced and deliver up the license i would not grieve her indeed i love her too well his voice trembled as well as his lips he took my hand saying you are hard on me i could make her happy i know because i worship her so i have been crazy about her for three years you can't call it a mere fancy why are you against me but god bless you good bye and he was gone why o will because i love my sister too much to see her miserable merely to make you happy friday 12th december my cripple friend that i mentioned so far back continues to send me the most affecting messages he is really wretched about me never was more distressed thinks of nothing else and so on through the whole list to cap the climax he sends me word that he can now walk on crutches and the first time he can venture in a buggy means to call on me que le ciel m'en préserve what could we talk about his'n and her'n several misfortunes that's too bad every one teases me unmercifully about my new conquest i can't help but be amused and yet beware young girls of expressing sympathy even for soldiers there is no knowing what effect it may produce sunday december 14th yesterday evening some time before sunset mr enders was announced to our great surprise as we knew he had been in clinton all the week having been transferred there instead of to jackson as he threatened he was the most miserable unhappy creature one could possibly imagine even too melancholy for me to laugh at him which expresses the last degree of wretchedness to all our questions he had but one answer that he had had the most dreadful attack of blues ever since he was here sunday that he had waited every evening at the cars expecting us and at last seeing that we had no intention of coming he could no longer stand the temptation so got permission to come down for a day to port hudson so he could come out to see us before we could fairly get him cheerful will carter and ned badger who returned only this week from kentucky entered will was in a bad humor and wanted to vent it on us so after waiting some time he proposed that the two young men should go with him pocketing at the same moment the cards which had won miriam and saying they would have a nice game together and just the rarest old whiskey he looked around to see the effect produced we girls did not move but mr enders said he must really return immediately to port hudson and start for clinton from there in the night will thought it would be such a triumph over us to carry him off that he insisted they'd have a fine time cure the blues etc ned was more than willing and at last mr enders said well he felt just so desperate that he did not care what he did he believed he would go i saw he was in a reckless humor and that will knew it too and i promised to make at least an effort to save him miriam spoke to him apart but he said he had promised now he must go will ran down triumphant to mount his horse calling him to follow all ran out to see him off when frank came back to tell me good bye i seized the opportunity and did n't i plead i told him i would not ask him to stay here though he knew we would be happy to have him stay and begged him to go back to the camp and leave will alone i suggested other resources talked of his mother whom he idolizes pleaded like a grandmother and just as i wound up came will's voice from below why the devil don't you come enders hurry he moved a step looked at me i dropped my head without a word here i must confess to the most consummate piece of acting i am sorry but as long as it saved him from doing what i knew he would have cause to regret i am not ashamed of having tried it will called impatiently again as he stood hesitating before me i did not say stay i just gave the faintest sigh imaginable he went down and told will he would not go of course will went off in a rage with us friday december 26th 1862 monday dr woods and mr van ingen stopped just from their regiment in kentucky and on their way home and i begged so hard to see the doctor and promised so faithfully to retire if i suffered too much that mrs badger yielded like an angel and i carried my point the doctor we looked in vain at each other i for my dandy friend in irreproachable broadcloth immaculate shirt bosoms and perfect boots he for the brusque impulsive girl who in ordinary circumstances would have run dancing into the parlor would have given him half glad half indifferent greeting and then found either occasion to laugh at him or would have turned elsewhere for amusement we looked i say in vain before me stood my pattern of neatness in a rough uniform of brown homespun a dark flannel shirt replaced the snowy cambric one and there was neither cravat nor collar to mark the boundary line between his dark face and the still darker material and the dear little boots o ye gods and little fishes they were clumsy and mud spattered if my mouth twitched with laughter as i silently commented the doctor's did not i who always danced on my way came in iying back on my pillows and wheeled in by a servant the doctor's sympathy was really touching and poor consolation he gave when he heard the story you will recover to a certain extent but will feel it more or less all your life i am the ruin of all these puns the gentlemen will hate me i must learn to ignore their conundrums until they answer them themselves and to wait patiently for the pun instead of catching it and laughing before it is half spoken why can't i do as the others do there was mr van ingen with his constant stream of them that i anticipated several times he said to me if i were asked what town in louisiana i would rather be in this evening what would my answer be i should have looked perfectly innocent and politely inquisitive but i did neither i saw the answer instantly and laughed ah you have guessed i can see it in your eyes he said of course i had but i told him i was afraid to say it for fear he might think i was flattering myself then we both laughed the place he referred to was bayou sarah yesterday being a beautiful day i was carried down in honor of christmas to meet captain fenner and mr duggan who were to dine with us the cars had brought miriam a beautiful little set of collars and cuffs from dellie and the oddest sweetest little set for me from morgan for our christmas gift it is all lilly we had an exquisite christmas gift the night before a magnificent serenade a compliment from colonel breaux it very singularly happened that miriam anna and ned badger were sitting up in the parlor watching alone for christmas when the band burst forth at the steps and startled them into a stampede upstairs but gibbes who came with the serenaders caught them and brought them back into the parlor where there were only eight gentlemen and in this novel unheard of style only these two girls with gibbes to play propriety entertained all these people at midnight while the band played without i commenced writing to day expressly to speak of our pleasant christmas yet it seems as though i would write about anything except that since i have not come to it yet perhaps it is because i feel i could not do it justice at least i can say who was there at sunset came captain bradford and mr conn the first stalking in with all the assurance which a handsome face and fine person can lend the second following with all the timidity of a first appearance again after a long pause the door swung open and enter mr halsey who bows and takes the seat on the other side of me and mr bradford of colonel allen memory once more returned to his regiment who laughs shakes hands all around and looks as happy as a schoolboy just come home for the holidays who has never ending visions of plumcakes puddings and other sweet things while all goes on merrily another rap comes and enter santa claus dressed in the old uniform of the mexican war with a tremendous cocked hat and preposterous beard of false hair which effectually conceal the face and but for the mass of tangled short curls no one could guess that the individual was bud it was a device of the general's which took us all by surprise santa claus passes slowly around the circle and pausing before each lady draws from his basket a cake which he presents with a bow while to each gentleman he presents a wineglass replenished from a most suspicious looking black bottle which also reposes there leaving us all wonder and laughter santa claus retires with a basket much lighter than it had been at his entrance then follow refreshments and more and more talk and laughter until the clock strikes twelve when all these ghosts bid a hearty good night and retire
thursday night december 31st 1863 the last of eighteen sixty three is passing away as i write every new year since i was in my teens i have sought a quiet spot where i could whisper to myself tennyson's death of the old year and even this bitter cold night i steal into my freezing tireless little room en robe de nuit to keep up my old habit while the others sleep old year you shall not die we did so laugh and cry with you i've half a mind to die with you old year if you must die no go and welcome bring peace and brighter days o dawning new year die faster and faster old one i count your remaining moments with almost savage glee
no 19 dauphine st saturday night december 31st 1864 one year ago in my little room in the camp street house i sat shivering over tennyson and my desk selfishly rejoicing over the departure of a year that had brought pain and discomfort only to me and eagerly welcoming the dawning of the new one whose first days were to bring death to george and gibbes and whose latter part was to separate me from miriam and brings me news of jimmy's approaching marriage o sad dreary fearful old year i see you go with pain bitter as you have been how do we know what the coming one has in store for us what new changes will it bring which of us will it take i am afraid of eighteen sixty five and have felt a vague dread of it for several years past nothing remains as it was a few months ago miriam went to lilly in the confederacy on the 19th of october ah miriam and mother and i have been boarding with mrs postlethwaite ever since i miss her sadly not as much though as i would were i less engaged for since the first week in august i have been teaching the children for sister and since we have been here i go to them every morning instead of their coming to me starting out at half past eight daily and returning a little before three does not leave me much time for melancholy reflections and there is no necessity for indulging in them at present they only give pain
february 5th thursday night a letter from lavinia has come to me all the way from california how happy it made me though written so long ago only the 30th of june lavinia has changed changed there is a sad worn out tone in every line it sounds old as though she had lived years and years ago and was writing as though she were dead and buried long since lavinia whose letters used to keep me in sunshine for weeks at a time well no wonder she is sad all these dreary years from home with so faint a hope of ever again seeing it and all these sorrows and troubles that have befallen us combined are not calculated to make her happy but i wish she had kept her cheerful heart well perhaps it is easier for us to be cheerful and happy knowing the full extent of our calamities than it is for her knowing so little and having just cause to fear so much courage better days are coming and then i'll have many a funny tale to tell her of the days when the yankees kept us on the qui vive or made us run for our lives it will tell merrily be almost as lively as those running days were one of my chief regrets over my helplessness is that i will not be able to run in the next stampede i used to enjoy it oh the days gone by the dreary days when cut off from our own people and surrounded by yankees we used to catch up any crumb of news favorable to our side that was smuggled into town and the brunots and i would write each other little dispatches of consolation and send them by little negroes those were dismal days yet how my spirits would rise when the long roll would beat and we would prepare for flight monday february 9th 1863 night a letter from my dear little jimmy how glad i am words could not express this is the first since he arrived in england and now we know what has become of him at last while awaiting the completion of the ironclad gunboat to which he has been appointed like a trump he has put himself to school and studies hard which is evident from the great improvement he already exhibits in his letter my delight at hearing from jimmy is overcast by the bad news lilly sends of mother's health i have been unhappy about her for a long while her health has been wretched for three months so bad that during all my long illness she has never been with me after the third day i was never separated from mother for so long before and i am homesick and heartsick about her only twenty miles apart and she with a shocking bone felon in her hand and that dreadful cough unable to come to me whilst i am iying helpless here as unable to get to her i feel right desperate about it this evening lilly writes of her having chills and fevers and looking very very badly so miriam started off instantly to see her my poor mother she will die if she stays in clinton i know she will wednesday february 18th gibbes has gone back to his regiment i can't say how dreary i felt when he came to tell me good bye i did not mean to cry but how could i help it when he put his arms around me sunday february 22d 1863 mother has come to me o how glad i was to see her this morning and the georgia project which i dared not speak of for fear it should be mere talk and nothing more is a reality yes we are actually going i can hardly believe that such good fortune as getting out of that wretched clinton really awaits us perhaps i shall not like augusta either a stranger in a strange city is not usually enchanted with everything one beholds but still a change of scene a new country new people it is worth while shall we really go will some page in this book actually record augusta georgia no i dare not believe it yet the mere thought has given me strength within the last two weeks to attempt to walk learning to walk at my age is it not amusing but the smallest baby knows more about it than i did at first of course i knew one foot was to be put before the other but the question was how it was to be done when they would not go i have conquered that difficulty however and can now walk almost two yards if some one holds me fast sunset will pinckney has this instant left ever since dinner he has been vehemently opposing the georgia move insisting that it will cost me my life by rendering me a confirmed cripple he says he could take care of me but no one else can so i must not be moved i am afraid his arguments have about shaken mother's resolution pshaw it will do me good i must go it will not do to remain here twenty seven thousand yankees are preparing to march on port hudson and this place will certainly be either occupied by them or burned to go to clinton is to throw myself in their hands so why not one grand move to augusta monday february 23d here goes news has been received that the yankees are already packed ready to march against us at any hour if i was up and well how my heart would swell with exultation as it is it throbs so with excitement that i can scarcely lie still hope amounts almost to presumption at port hudson they are confident that our fifteen thousand can repulse twice the number great god i say it with all reverence if we could defeat them if we could scatter capture annihilate them my heart beats but one prayer victory i shall grow wild repeating it in the mean time though linwood is in danger this dear place my second home its loved inhabitants think of their being in such peril oh i shall cry heartily if harm comes to them but i must leave before no use of leaving my bones for the yankees to pick better sing dixie in georgia to morrow consequently i go to that earthly paradise clinton thence to be re shipped so goes the present programme to augusta in three days and no time for adieux wonder who will be surprised who vexed and who will cry over the unforeseen separation not a single good bye nothing except an old brass button that mr halsey gave me as a souvenir in case he should be killed in the coming assault it is too bad ah destiny destiny where do you take us during these two trying years i have learned to feel myself a mere puppet in the hands of a something that takes me here to day to morrow there always unexpectedly and generally very unwillingly but at last leads me somewhere or other right side up with care after a thousand troubles and distresses the hand of destiny is on me now where will it lead me tuesday february 24th meeting miriam by mere accident on the road last evening and hearing of our surprising journey to georgia mr halsey came to spend a last evening with us and say good bye what a deluge of regrets hopes fears etc perfectly overwhelming why had i not told him of it the night before all our friends would be so disappointed at not having an opportunity of saying good bye if the yankees would only postpone their attack so he might accompany us but no matter he would come on in two months and meet us there and would we not write to him thank you miriam may but i shall hardly do so we had such a pleasant evening together talking over our trip then we had a dozen songs on the guitar gay sad and sentimental then he gave me a sprig of jessamine as a keepsake and i ripped open my celebrated running bag to get a real for true silver five cents a perfect curiosity in these days which i gave him in exchange and which he promised to wear on his watch chain he and miriam amused themselves examining the contents of my sack and laughing at my treasures the wretches then came good bye i think he was sorry to see us go well he ought to miss us ah these farewells to day i bid adieu to linwood it may be for years and it may be forever this good bye will cost me a sigh wednesday february 25th here we are still in spite of our expectations difficulty on difficulty arose and an hour before the cars came it was settled that mother should go to clinton and make the necessary arrangements and leave us to follow in a day or two two days more miriam no more objected than i did so mother went alone poor miriam went to bed soon after very ill so ill that she lay groaning in bed at dusk when a stir was heard in the hall below and colonel steadman major spratley and mr dupré were announced presto up she sprang and flew about in the most frantic style emptying the trunk on the floor to get her prettiest dress and acting as though she had never heard of pains and groans when we leave how much i shall miss the fun of seeing her and anna running over each other in their excitement of dressing for their favorites anna's first exclamation was ain't you glad you did n't go and certainly we were not sorry from mere compassion for what would she have done with all three if i laughed at their extra touches to their dresses it did not prevent me from bestowing unusual attention on my own and by way of bravado when i was carried down i insisted on mrs badger lending me her arm to let me walk into the parlor and prove to colonel steadman that in spite of his prophecies i was able to take a few steps at least his last words you won't go will you think once more sent me upstairs wondering thinking undecided and unsatisfied hardly knowing what to do or what to say every time i tried to sleep those calm deep honest gray eyes started up before my closed ones and that earnest you won't go will you think once more rang in my ears like a solemn warning hopes of seeing georgia grew rather faint that night is it lawful to risk my life but is it not better to lose it while believing that i have still a chance of saving it by going than to await certain death calmly and unresisting in clinton i'd rather die struggling for this life this beautiful loved blessed life that god has given me
wednesday february 3d last night we were thrown into the most violent state of commotion by the unexpected entrance of captain bradford he has been brought here a prisoner from asphodel where he has been ever since the surrender of port hudson and taking advantage of his tri weekly parole his first visit was naturally here as he has no other friends poor creature how he must have suffered the first glance at his altered face where suffering and passion have both left their traces unmistakably since we last met and the mere sight of his poor lame leg filled my heart with compassion how he hates mr halsey i could not forego the pleasure of provoking him into a discussion about him knowing how they hated each other he would not say anything against him understand that as a gentleman and a companion mr halsey was his warmest and best friend there was no one he admired more but he must say that as a soldier he was the worst he had ever seen not that he was not as brave and gallant a man as ever lived but he neglected his duties most shamefully while visiting linwood so constantly eluding the sentinels daily as he asked for neither pass nor permission and consulting only his inclinations instead of his superior officers or his business and that last night at linwood when he absented himself without leave why could he not have signified to him his captain that he wished to say good bye instead of quietly doing as he pleased when the colonel sent for a report of the number of men quantity of forage and ammunition etc and it was discovered that john halsey was absent without leave with the books locked up and the keys in his pocket even after this lapse of time the fire flashed through the ice as the captain spoke sergeant halsey i am sorry for you when you reported yourself next day all the fun that could have been crowded into an evening at linwood could not have repaid you for the morning's scene and after all what was it beyond very empty pleasure with a great deal of laughter he could have dispensed with it just as well looking back i congratulate myself on being the only one who did not ask him to stay 5th not dead not dead o my god gibbes is not dead where o dear god another only a few days ago came a letter so cheerful and hopeful we have waited and prayed so patiently at my feet lies one from colonel steadman saying he is dead dead suddenly and without a moment's warning summoned to god no it cannot be i am mad o god have mercy on us my poor mother and lydia lydia god comfort you my brain seems afire am i mad not yet god would not take him yet he will come again hush god is good not dead not dead o gibbes come back to us 11th o god o god have mercy on us george is dead both in a week george our sole hope our sole dependence
here i am at your service madame idleness waiting for any suggestion it may please you to put in my weary brain as a means to pass this dull cloudy sunday afternoon for the great pike clock over the way has this instant struck only half past three and if a rain is added to the high wind that has been blowing ever since the month commenced and prevents my going to mrs brunot's before dark i fear i shall fall a victim to the blues for the first time in my life indeed it is dull miriam went to linewood with lydia yesterday and i miss them beyond all expression miriam is so funny she says she cannot live without me and yet she can go away and stay for months without missing me in the slightest degree extremely funny and i well it is absurd to fancy myself alive without miriam she would rather not visit with me and yet be it for an hour or a month i never halfway enjoy myself without her away from home miriam is my rock ahead in life i'll founder on her yet it's a grand sight for people out of reach who will not come in contact with the breakers but it is quite another thing to me perpetually dancing on those sharp points in my little cockleshell that forms so ludicrous a contrast to the grand scene around i am sure to founder i hold that every family has at heart one genius in some line no matter what except in our family where each is a genius in his own way hem and miriam has a genius for the piano now i never could bear to compete with any one knowing that it is the law of my being to be inferior to others consequently to fail and failure is so humiliating to me so it is that people may force me to abandon any pursuit by competing with me for knowing that failure is inevitable rather than fight against destiny i give up de bonne grâce originally i was said to have a talent for the piano as well as miriam sister and miss isabella said i would make a better musician than she having more patience and perseverance however i took hardly six months lessons to her ever so many years heard how well she played got disgusted with myself and gave up the piano at fourteen with spasmodic fits of playing every year or so at sixteen harry gave me a guitar here was a new field where i would have no competitors i knew no one who played on it so i set to work and taught myself to manage it mother only teaching me how to tune it but miriam took a fancy to it and i taught her all i knew but as she gained i lost my relish and if she had not soon abandoned it i would know nothing of it now she does not know half that i do about it they tell me i play much better than she yet they let her play on it in company before me and i cannot pretend to play after why is it it is not vanity or i would play confident of excelling her it is not jealousy for i love to see her show her talents it is not selfishness i love her too much to be selfish to her what is it then simply lack of self esteem i would say if there was no phrenologist near to correct me and point out that well developed hump at the extreme southern and heavenward portion of my morgan head self esteem or not mr phrenologist the result is that miriam is by far the best performer in baton rouge and i would rank forty third even in the delectable village of jackson and yet i must have some ear for music to know as many songs as sarah is a family proverb not very difficult songs or very beautiful ones to be sure besides being very indifferently sung but the tunes will run in my head and it must take some ear to catch them people say to me of course you play to which i invariably respond oh no but miriam plays beautifully you sing i believe not at all except for father that is what i used to say and the children but miriam sings you are fond of dancing very but i cannot dance as well as miriam of course you are fond of society no indeed miriam is and she goes to all the parties and returns all the visits for me the consequence is that if the person who questions is a stranger he goes off satisfied that that miriam must be a great girl but that little sister of hers well a prig to say the least so it is miriam catches all my fish and so it is too that it is not raining and i'm off
march 10th tuesday i had so many nice things to say which now alas are knocked forever from my head when news came that the yankees were advancing on us and were already within fifteen miles the panic which followed reminded me forcibly of our running days in baton rouge each one rapidly threw into trunks all clothing worth saving with silver and valuables to send to the upper plantation i sprang up determined to leave instantly for clinton so mother would not be alarmed for our safety but before i got halfway dressed helen carter came in and insisted on my remaining declaring that my sickness and inability to move would prove a protection to the house and save it from being burned over their heads put on that plea though i have no faith in melting the bowels of compassion of a yankee myself i consented to remain as miriam urgently represented the dangers awaiting clinton so she tossed all we owned into our trunk to send to mother as hostage of our return and it is now awaiting the cars my earthly possessions are all reposing by me on the bed at this instant consisting of my guitar a change of clothes running bag cabas and this book for in spite of their entreaties i would not send it to clinton expecting those already there to meet with a fiery death though i would like to preserve those of the most exciting year of my life they tell me that this will be read aloud to me to torment me but i am determined to burn it if there is any danger of that why i would die without some means of expressing my feelings in the stirring hours so rapidly approaching i shall keep it by me such bustle and confusion every one hurried anxious excited whispering packing trunks sending them off wondering negroes looking on in amazement until ordered to mount the carts waiting at the door which are to carry them too away how disappointed the yankees will be at finding only white girls instead of their dear sisters and brothers whom they love so tenderly sorry for their disappointment they say they are advancing in overwhelming numbers that is nothing so long as god helps us and from our very souls we pray his blessing on us in this our hour of need for myself i cannot yet fully believe they are coming it would be a relief to have it over i have taken the responsibility of lydia's jewelry on my shoulders and hope to be able to save it in the rush which will take place down at the cars miriam met frank enders going to clinton in charge of a car full of yankees deserters who came into our lines he thinks just as i do that our trunks are safer here than there now that they are all off we all agree that it was the most foolish thing we could have done these yankees interfere with all our arrangements i am almost ashamed to confess what an absurdly selfish thought occurred to me a while ago i was lamenting to myself all the troubles that surround us the dangers and difficulties that perplex us thinking of the probable fate that might befall some of our brave friends and defenders in port hudson when i thought too of the fun we would miss horrid was it not but worse than that i was longing for something to read when i remembered frank told me he had sent to alexandria for bulwer's strange story for me and then i unconsciously said how i wish it would get here before the yankees i am very anxious to read it but confess i am ashamed of having thought of it at such a crisis so i toss up the farthing frank gave me for a keepsake the other day and say i'll try in future to think less of my own comfort and pleasure poor mr halsey what a sad fate the pets he procures for me meet he stopped here just now on his way somewhere and sent me a curious bundle with a strange story by miriam it seems he got a little flying squirrel for me to play with must know my partiality for pets and last night while attempting to tame him the little creature bit his finger whereupon he naturally let him fall on the ground temper which put a period to his existence he had the nerve to skin him after the foul murder and sent all that remains of him out to me to prove his original intention the softest longest prettiest fur and such a duck of a tail poor little animal could n't have been larger than my fist wonder if its spirit will meet with that of the little bird which flew heavenward with all that pink ribbon and my letter from mr halsey saturday march 14th 5 o'clock p.m they are coming the yankees are coming at last for four or five hours the sound of their cannon has assailed our ears there that one shook my bed oh they are coming god grant us the victory they are now within four miles of us on the big road to baton rouge on the road from town to clinton we have been fighting since daylight at readbridge and have been repulsed fifteen gunboats have passed vicksburg they say it will be an awful fight no matter with god's help we'll conquer yet again the report comes nearer oh they are coming coming to defeat i pray god only we seven women remain in the house the general left this morning to our unspeakable relief they would hang him we fear if they should find him here mass gene has gone to his company we are left alone here to meet them if they will burn the house they will have to burn me in it for i cannot walk and i know they shall not carry me i'm resigned if i should burn i have friends and brothers enough to avenge me create such a consternation better than being thrown from a buggy only i'd not survive to hear of it letter from lilly to day has distressed me beyond measure starvation which threatened them seems actually at their door with more money than they could use in ordinary times they can find nothing to purchase not a scrap of meat in the house for a week no pork no potatoes fresh meat obtained once as a favor and poultry and flour articles unheard of besides that tiche crippled and margret very ill while liddy has run off to the yankees heaven only knows what will become of them the other day we were getting ready to go to them thursday when the general disapproved of my running such a risk saying he'd call it a d piece of nonsense if i asked what he thought so we remained they will certainly starve soon enough without our help and yet i feel we should all be together still that last superfluous word is the refrain of gibbes's song that is ringing in my ears and that i am chanting in a kind of ecstasy of excitement then let the cannon boom as it will we'll be gay and happy still and we will be happy in spite of yankee guns only my dear this that and the other at port hudson how i pray for your safety god spare our brave soldiers and lead them to victory i write touch my guitar talk pick lint and pray so rapidly that it is hard to say which is my occupation i sent frank some lint the other day and a bundle of it for mr halsey is by me hope neither will need it but to my work again half past one o'clock a m it has come at last what an awful sound i thought i had heard a bombardment before but baton rouge was child's play compared to this at half past eleven came the first gun at least the first i heard and i hardly think it could have commenced many moments before instantly i had my hand on miriam and at my first exclamation mrs badger and anna answered all three sprang to their feet to dress while all four of us prayed aloud such an incessant roar and at every report the house shaking so and we thinking of our dear soldiers the dead and dying and crying aloud for god's blessing on them and defeat and overthrow to their enemies that dreadful roar i can't think fast enough they are too quick to be counted we have all been in mrs carter's room from the last window of which we can see the incessant flash of the guns and the great shooting stars of flame which must be the hot shot of the enemy there is a burning house in the distance the second one we have seen to night for yankees can't prosper unless they are pillaging honest people already they have stripped all on their road of cattle mules and negroes gathered in a knot within and without the window we six women up here watched in the faint starlight the flashes from the guns and silently wondered which of our friends were iying stiff and dead and then shuddering at the thought betook ourselves to silent prayer i think we know what it is to wrestle with god in prayer we had but one thought yet for women we took it almost too coolly no tears no cries no fear though for the first five minutes everybody's teeth chattered violently mrs carter had her husband in fenner's battery the hottest place if they are attacked by the land force and yet to my unspeakable relief she betrayed no more emotion than we who had only friends there we know absolutely nothing when does one ever know anything in the country but we presume that this is an engagement between our batteries and the gunboats attempting to run the blockade firing has slackened considerably all are to lie down already dressed but being in my nightgown from necessity i shall go to sleep though we may expect at any instant to hear the tramp of yankee cavalry in the yard sunday march 15th to my unspeakable surprise i waked up this morning and found myself alive once satisfied of that and assuring myself of intense silence in the place of the great guns which rocked me to sleep about half past two this morning i began to doubt that i had heard any disturbance in the night and to believe i had written a dream within a dream and that no bombardment had occurred but all corroborate my statement so it must be true and this portentous silence is only the calm before the storm i am half afraid the land force won't attack we can beat them if they do but suppose they lay siege to port hudson and starve us out that is the only way they can conquer we hear nothing still that is reliable just before daylight there was a terrific explosion which electrified every one save myself i was sleeping so soundly that i did not hear anything of it though mrs badger says that when she sprang up and called me i talked very rationally about it and asked what it could possibly be thought that i had ceased talking in my sleep miriam was quite eloquent in her dreams before the attack crying aloud see see what do i behold as though she were witnessing a rehearsal of the scene to follow later dr kennedy has just passed through and was within the fortifications last night brings news which is perhaps reliable as it was obtained from gardiner it was as we presumed the batteries and gunboats one we sunk another the mississippi we disabled so that the yankees had to abandon and set fire to her thirty nine prisoners falling into our hands it was her magazine that exploded this morning two other boats succeeded in passing though badly crippled our batteries fired gallantly hurrah for colonel steadman i know his was by no means the least efficient clinton they say will inevitably be sacked alas for mother and lilly what can we do the whole country is at the mercy of the yankees as long as gardiner keeps within the fortifications six miles below here they entered mr newport's pulled the pillow cases from the beds stuffed them with his clothes and helped themselves generally what can we expect here to tell the truth i should be disappointed if they did not even look in at us on their marauding expedition march 17th on dit the yankees have gone back to baton rouge hearing we had sixty thousand men coming down after them i believe i am positively disappointed i did want to see them soundly thrashed the light we thought was another burning house was that of the mississippi they say the shrieks of the men when our hot shells fell among them and after they were left by their companions to burn were perfectly appalling another letter from lilly has distressed me beyond measure she says the one chicken and two dozen eggs miriam and i succeeded in buying from the negroes by prayers and entreaties saved them from actual hunger and for two days they had been living on one egg apiece and some cornbread and syrup great heavens has it come to this nothing to be bought in that abominable place for love or money where the next meal comes from nobody knows wednesday march 25th early last evening the tremendous clatter of a sword that made such unnecessary noise that one might imagine the owner thereof had betaken himself to the favorite pastime of his childhood and was prancing in on his murderous weapon having mistaken it for his war steed announced the arrival of captain bradford who with two friends came to say adieu those vile yankees have been threatening ponchatoula and his battery with a regiment of infantry was on its way there to drive them back the captain sent me word of the distressing departure with many assurances that he would take care of my john scarcely had he departed when lo john arrives and speaks for himself yes he is going only a moment to say good bye sunset approaches well he must say good bye now chorus of young ladies oh will you not spend the evening with us you can easily overtake the battery later chorus of married ladies you must not think of going here is a comfortable room at your service and after an early breakfast you can be on the road as soon as the others no necessity for prayers he readily consents and yet as the evening wore on when we laughed loudest i could not help but think of poor little mrs mcphaul sitting alone and crying over her brother's departure fancying his precious bones iying on the damp ground with only the soldier's roof the blue vault of heaven above while two miles away he sat in a comfortable parlor amusing himself about sunrise while the most delightful dreams floated through my brain a little voice roused me exclaiming sady sady john hawsey say so say give sady i opened my eyes to see little gibbes standing by me trying to lay some flowers on my cheek his little face sparkling with delight at his own importance a half opened rosebud with the faintest blush of pink on its creamy leaves a pink and a piece of arbor vitæ all sprinkled with dew this was my bouquet the servant explained that mr halsey had just left and sent me that with his last good bye and he has gone and now there's nothing left but weeping his face i ne'er shall see and naught is left to me save putting away my book and all recollections of nonsense so here goes tuesday march 31st to be or not to be that's the question whether t is nobler in the confederacy to suffer the pangs of unappeasable hunger and never ending trouble or to take passage to a yankee port and there remaining end them which is best i am so near daft that i cannot pretend to say i only know that i shudder at the thought of going to new orleans and that my heart fails me when i think of the probable consequence to mother if i allow a mere outward sign of patriotism to overbalance what should be my first consideration her health for clinton is growing no better rapidly to be hungry is there an everyday occurrence for ten days mother writes they have lived off just hominy enough to keep their bodies and souls from parting without being able to procure another article not even a potato mother is not in a condition to stand such privation day by day she grows weaker on her new regimen i am satisfied that two months more of danger difficulties perplexities and starvation will lay her in her grave the latter alone is enough to put a speedy end to her days lilly has been obliged to put her children to bed to make them forget they were supperless and when she followed their example could not sleep herself for very hunger we have tried in vain to find another home in the confederacy after three days spent in searching augusta gibbes wrote that it was impossible to find a vacant room for us as the city was already crowded with refugees a kind providence must have destined that disappointment in order to save my life if there is any reason for colonel steadman's fears we next wrote to mobile brandon and even that horrid little liberty besides making inquiries of every one we met while charlie too was endeavoring to find a place and everywhere received the same answer not a vacant room and provisions hardly to be obtained at all the question has now resolved itself to whether we shall see mother die for want of food in clinton or by sacrificing an outward show of patriotism the inward sentiment cannot be changed go with her to new orleans as brother begs in the few letters he contrives to smuggle through it looks simple enough ought not mother's life to be our first consideration undoubtedly but suppose we could preserve her life and our free sentiments at the same time if we could only find a resting place in the confederacy this though is impossible but to go to new orleans to cease singing dixie to be obliged to keep your sentiments to yourself for i would not wound brother by any ultra secession speech and such could do me no good and only injure him if he is as friendly with the federals as they say he is to listen to the scurrilous abuse heaped on those fighting for our homes and liberties among them my three brothers could i endure it i fear not even if i did not go crazy i would grow so restless homesick and miserable that i would pray for even clinton again oh i don't don't want to go if mother would only go alone and leave us with lilly but she is as anxious to obtain dr stone's advice for me as we are to secure her a comfortable home and i won't go anywhere without miriam so we must all go together yet there is no disguising the fact that such a move will place us in a very doubtful position to both friends and enemies however all our friends here warmly advocate the move and will pinckney and frank both promised to knock down any one who shrugged their shoulders and said anything about it but what would the boys say the fear of displeasing them is my chief distress george writes in the greatest distress about my prolonged illness and his alarm about my condition of one thing i am sure he writes and that is that she deserves to recover for a better little sister never lived god bless him my eyes grew right moist over those few words loving words bring tears to them sooner than angry ones would he object to such a step when he knows that the very medicines necessary for my recovery are not to be procured in the whole country would he rather have mother dead and me a cripple in the confederacy than both well out of it i feel that if we go we are wrong but i am satisfied that it is worse to stay it is a distressing dilemma to be placed in as we are certain to be blamed whichever course we pursue but i don't want to go to new orleans before i had time to lay down my pen this evening general gardiner and major wilson were announced and i had to perform a hasty toilette before being presentable the first remark of the general was that my face recalled many pleasant recollections that he had known my family very well but that time was probably beyond my recollection and he went on talking about father and lavinia until i felt quite comfortable with this utter stranger i would prefer his speaking of our recent success at port hudson to my for we each man woman and child feel that we share the glory of sinking the gunboats and sending banks back to baton rouge without venturing on an attack and it seemed odd to hear any one assume the responsibility of the whole affair and say my success so unconsciously but this may be the privilege of generals i am no judge as this is the first confederate general i have had the pleasure of seeing wish it had been old stonewall i grow enthusiastic every time i think of the dear old fellow i am indebted to general gardiner for a great piece of kindness though i was telling him of how many enemies he had made among the ladies by his strict regulations that now rendered it almost impossible for the gentlemen to obtain permission to call on them when he told me if i would signify to my friends to mention when they applied that their visit was to be here and not elsewhere that he would answer for their having a pass whenever they called for one merci au compliment mais c'est trop tard monsieur
march dead dead both dead o my brothers what have we lived for except you we who would have so gladly laid down our lives for yours are left desolate to mourn over all we loved and hoped for weak and helpless while you so strong noble and brave have gone before us without a murmur god knows best but it is hard o so hard to give them up if we had had any warning or preparation this would not have been so unspeakably awful but to shut one's eyes to all dangers and risks and drown every rising fear with god will send them back i will not doubt his mercy and then suddenly to learn that your faith has been presumption and god wills that you shall undergo bitter affliction it is a fearful awakening what glory have we ever rendered to god that we should expect him to be so merciful to us are not all things his and is not he infinitely more tender and compassionate than we deserve we have deceived ourselves wilfully about both after the first dismay on hearing of gibbes's capture we readily listened to the assertions of our friends that johnson's island was the healthiest place in the world that he would be better off comfortably clothed and under shelter than exposed to shot and shell half fed and lying on the bare ground during ewell's winter campaign we were thankful for his safety knowing brother would leave nothing undone that could add to his comfort and besides that there was the sure hope of his having him paroled on that hope we lived all winter now confident that in a little while he would be with us then again doubting for a while only to have the hope grow surer afterwards and so we waited and prayed never doubting he would come at last he himself believed it though striving not to be too hopeful lest he should disappoint us as well as himself yet he wrote cheerfully and bravely to the last towards the middle of january brother was sure of succeeding as all the prisoners had been placed under butler's control ah me how could we be so blind we were sure he would be with us in a few weeks i wrote to him that i had prepared his room on the 30th of january came his last letter addressed to me though meant for lavinia it was dated the 12th the day george died all his letters pleaded that i would write more frequently he loved to hear from me so i had been writing to him every ten days on the 3d of february i sent my last friday the 5th as i was running through miriam's room i saw brother pass the door and heard him ask miriam for mother the voice the bowed head the look of utter despair on his face struck through me like a knife gibbes gibbes was my sole thought but miriam and i stood motionless looking at each other without a word gibbes is dead said mother as he stood before her he did not speak and then we went in we did not ask how or when that he was dead was enough for us but after a while he told us uncle james had written that he had died at two o'clock on thursday the 21st still we did not know how he had died several letters that had been brought remained unopened on the floor one brother opened hoping to learn something more it was from colonel steadman to miriam and me written a few hours after his death and contained the sad story of our dear brother's last hours he had been in colonel steadman's ward of the hospital for more than a week with headache and sore throat but it was thought nothing he seemed to improve and expected to be discharged in a few days on the 21st he complained that his throat pained him again after prescribing for him and talking cheerfully with him for some time colonel steadman left him surrounded by his friends to attend to his other patients he had hardly reached his room when some one ran to him saying captain morgan was dying he hurried to his bedside and found him dead captain steadman sick in the next bed and those around him said he had been talking pleasantly with them when he sat up to reach his cup of water on the table as soon as he drank it he seemed to suffocate and after tossing his arms wildly in the air and making several fearful efforts to breathe he died hush mother hush i said when i heard her cries we have brother and george and jimmy left and lydia has lost all heaven pity us george had gone before only he in mercy kept the knowledge of it from us for a while longer on thursday the 11th as we sat talking to mother striving to make her forget the weary days we had cried through with that fearful sound of dead dead ringing ever in our ears some one asked for miriam she went down and presently i heard her thanking somebody for a letter you could not have brought me anything more acceptable it is from my sister though she can hardly have heard from us yet i ran back and sitting at mother's feet told her miriam was coming with a letter from lydia mother cried at the mention of her name o my little sister you know how dear you are to us mother mother a horrible voice cried and before i could think who it was miriam rushed in holding an open letter in her hand and perfectly wild george is dead she shrieked and fell heavily to the ground o my god i could have prayed thee to take mother too when i looked at her i thought i almost hoped she was dead and that pang spared but i was wild myself i could have screamed laughed it is false do you hear me mother god would not take both george is not dead i cried trying in vain to arouse her from her horrible state or bring one ray of reason to her eye i spoke to a body alive only to pain not a sound of my voice seemed to reach her only fearful moans showed she was yet alive miriam lay raving on the ground poor miriam her heart's idol torn away god help my darling i did not understand that george could die until i looked at her in vain i strove to raise her from the ground or check her wild shrieks for death george only george she would cry until at last with the horror of seeing both die before me i mastered strength enough to go for the servant and bid her run quickly for brother how long i stood there alone i never knew i remember ada coming in hurriedly and asking what it was i told her george was dead it was a relief to see her cry i could not but i felt the pain afresh as though it were her brother she was crying over not mine and the sight of her tears brought mine too we could only cry over mother and miriam we could not rouse them we did not know what to do some one called me in the entry i went not understanding what i was doing a lady came to me told me her name and said something about george but i could not follow what she said it was as though she was talking in a dream i believe she repeated the words several times for at last she shook me and said listen rouse yourself the letter is about george yes i said he is dead she said i must read the letter but i could not see so she read it aloud it was from dr mitchell his friend who was with him when he died telling of his sickness and death he died on tuesday the 11th of january after an illness of six days conscious to the last and awaiting the end as only a christian and one who has led so beautiful a life could with the grace of god look for it he sent messages to his brothers and sisters and bade them tell his mother his last thoughts were of her and that he died trusting in the mercy of the saviour george our pride our beautiful angel brother could he die surely god has sent all these afflictions within these three years to teach us that our hopes must be placed above and that it is blasphemy to have earthly idols the letter said that the physicians had mistaken his malady which was inflammation of the bowels and he had died from being treated for something else it seemed horrible cruelty to read me that part i knew that if mother or miriam ever heard of it it would kill them so i begged mrs mitchell never to let them hear of it she seemed to think nothing of the pain it would inflict how could she help telling if they asked she said i told her i must insist on her not mentioning it it would only add suffering to what was already insupportable if they asked for the letter offer to read it aloud but say positively that she would not allow any one to touch it except herself and then she might pass it over in silence i roused miriam then and sent her to hear it read she insisted on reading it herself and half dead with grief held out her hands begging piteously to be suffered to read it alone i watched then until i was sure mrs mitchell would keep her promise horrible as i knew it to be from strange lips i knew by what i experienced that i had saved her from a shock that might cost her her life and then i went back to mother no need to conceal what i felt there she neither spoke nor saw if i had shrieked that he died of ill treatment she would not have understood but i sat there silently with that horrible secret wondering if god would help me bear it or if despair would deprive me of self control and force me presently to cry it aloud though it should kill them both at last brother came i had to meet him downstairs and tell him god spare me the sight of a strong man's grief then sister came in knowing as little as he poor sister i could have blessed her for every tear she shed it was a comfort to see some one who had life or feeling left i felt as though the whole world was dead nothing was real nothing existed except horrible speechless pain life was a fearful dream through which but one thought ran dead dead miriam had been taken to her room more dead than alive mother lay speechless in hers the shock of this second blow had obliterated with them all recollection of the first it was a mercy i envied them for i remembered both until loss of consciousness would have seemed a blessing i shall never forget mother's shriek of horror when towards evening she recalled it o those dreadful days of misery and wretchedness it seems almost sacrilege to refer to them now they are buried in our hearts with our boys thought of with prayers and tears how will the world seem to us now what will life be without the boys when this terrible strife is over and so many thousands return to their homes what will peace bring us of all we hoped jimmy dear lord spare us that one
until that dreary 1861 i had no idea of sorrow or grief how i love to think of myself at that time not as myself but as some happy careless child who danced through life loving god's whole world too much to love any particular one outside of her own family she was more childish then yet i like her for all her folly i can say it now for she is as dead as though she was lying underground now do not imagine that sarah has become an aged lady in the fifteen months that have elapsed since for it is no such thing her heart does ache occasionally but that is a secret between her and this little rosewood furnished room and when she gets over it there is no one more fond of making wheelbarrows of the children or of catching charlie or mother by the foot and making them play lame chicken now all this done by a young lady who remembers eighteen months ago with so much regret that she has lost so much of her high spirits might argue that her spirits were before tremendous and yet they were not that other sarah was ladylike i am sure in her wildest moments but there is something hurried and boisterous in this one's tricks that reminds me of some one who is making a merit of being jolly under depressing circumstances no that is not a nice sarah now to my taste the commencement of 61 promised much pleasure for the rest of the year and though secession was talked about i do not believe any one anticipated the war that has been desolating our country ever since with no prospect of terminating for some time to come true the garrison was taken but then several pleasant officers of the louisiana army were stationed there and made quite an agreeable addition to our small parties and we did not think for a moment that trouble would grow out of it at least we girls did not next louisiana seceded but still we did not trouble ourselves with gloomy anticipations for many strangers visited the town and our parties rides and walks grew gayer and more frequent one little party shall i ever forget it was on the 9th of march i think such an odd funny little party such queer things happened what a fool mr mcg made of himself even more so than usual but hush it's not fair to laugh at a lady under peculiar circumstances and he tried so hard to make himself agreeable poor fellow that i ought to like him for being so obedient to my commands say something new something funny i said tired of a subject on which he had been expatiating all the evening for i had taken a long ride with him before sunset he had escorted me to mrs brunot's and here he was still at my side and his conversation did not interest me to hear with him was to obey something funny well here he commenced telling something about somebody the fun of which seemed to consist in the somebody's having knocked his shins against something else i only listened to the latter part i was bored and showed it shins was i to laugh at such a story day before yesterday just about this time of evening as i came home from the graveyard jimmy unexpectedly came in ever since the 12th of february he has been waiting on the yankees pleasure in the mississippi at all places below columbus and having been under fire for thirteen days at tiptonville island no 10 having surrendered monday night and commodore hollins thinking it high time to take possession of the ironclad ram at new orleans and give them a small party below the forts he carried off his little aide from the mcrae tuesday morning and left him here thursday evening to our infinite delight for we felt as though we would never again see our dear little jimmy he has grown so tall and stout that it is really astonishing considering the short time he has been away to our great distress he jumped up from dinner and declared he must go to the city on the very nextboat commodore hollins would need him he must be at his post etc and in twenty minutes he was off the rascal before we could believe he had been here at all there is something in his eye that reminds me of harry and tells me that like hal he will die young and these days that are going by remind me of hal too i am walking in our footsteps of last year the eighth was the day we gave him a party on his return home i see him so distinctly standing near the pier table talking to mr sparks whom he had met only that morning and who three weeks after had harry's blood upon his hands he is a murderer now without aim or object in life as before with only one desire to die and death still flees from him and he dares not rid himself of life all those dancing there that night have undergone trial and affliction since father is dead and harry mr trezevant lies at corinth with his skull fractured by a bullet every young man there has been in at least one battle since and every woman has cried over her son brother or sweetheart going away to the wars or lying sick and wounded and yet we danced that night and never thought of bloodshed the week before louisiana seceded jack wheat stayed with us and we all liked him so much and he thought so much of us and last week a week ago to day he was killed on the battlefield of shiloh among the many who visited us in the beginning of 1861 there was mr bradford i took a dislike to him the first time i ever saw him and being accustomed to say just what i pleased to all the other gentlemen tried it with him it was at dinner and for a long while i had the advantage and though father would sometimes look grave gibbes and all at my end of the table would scream with laughter at last mr bradford commenced to retaliate and my dislike changed into respect for a man who could make an excellent repartee with perfect good breeding and after dinner when the others took their leave and he asked permission to remain during his visit which lasted until ten o'clock he had gone over such a variety of subjects conversing so well upon all that miriam and i were so interested that we forgot to have the gas lit and another was silly little mr b r my little golden calf what a don't call names i owe him a grudge for cold hands and the other day when i heard of his being wounded at shiloh i could not help laughing a little at tom b r's being hurt what was the use of throwing a nice big cannon ball that might have knocked a man down away on that poor little fellow when a pea from a popgun would have made the same impression not but what he is brave but little mr.b r is so soft then there was that rattle brain mr t t who commencing one subject never ceased speaking until he had touched on all one evening he came in talking and never paused even for a reply until he bowed himself out talking still when mr bradford who had been forced to silence as well as the rest threw himself back with a sigh of relief and exclaimed this man talks like a woman i thought it the best description of mr t t's conversation i had ever heard it was all on the surface no pretensions to anything except to put the greatest possible number of words of no meaning in one sentence while speaking of the most trivial thing night or day mr t t never passed home without crying out to me ces jolis yeux bleus and if the parlor were brightly lighted so that all from the street might see us and be invisible to us themselves i always nodded my head to the outer darkness and laughed no matter who was present though it sometimes created remark you see i knew the joke coming from a party escorted by mr b r miriam by mr t t 1 we had to wait a long time before rose opened the door which interval i employed in dancing up and down the gallery followed by my cavalier singing mes jolis yeux bleus bleus comme les cieux mes jolis yeux bleus ont ravi son âme etc which naïve remark mr b r not speaking french lost entirely and mr t t endorsed it with his approbation and belief in it and ever afterwards called me ces jolis yeux bleus another date in hal's short history i see myself walking home with mr mcg just after sundown meeting miriam and dr woods at the gate only that was a friday instead of a saturday as this from the other side mr sparks comes up and joins us we stand talking in the bright moonlight which makes miriam look white and statue like i am holding roses in my hand in return for which one little pansy has been begged from my garden and is now figuring as a shirt stud i turn to speak to that man of whom i said to dr woods before i even knew his name who is this man who passes here so constantly i feel that i shall hate him to my dying day he told me his name was sparks a good harmless fellow etc and afterwards when i did know him dr woods would ask every time we met well do you hate sparks yet i could not really hate any one in my heart so i always answered he is a good natured fool but i will hate him yet but even now i cannot my only feeling is intense pity for the man who has dealt us so severe a blow who made my dear father bow his gray head and shed such bitter tears the moon is rising still higher now and people are hurrying to the grand meeting where the state of the country is to be discussed and the three young men bow and hurry off too later at eleven o'clock miriam and i are up at lydia's waiting until the boat comes with miss comstock who is going away as usual i am teasing and romping by turns harry suddenly stands in the parlor door looking very grave and very quiet he is holding father's stick in his hand and says he has come to take us over home i was laughing still so i said wait while i prepared for some last piece of folly but he smiled for the first time and throwing his arm around me said come home you rogue and laughing still i followed him he left us in the hall saying he must go to charlie's a moment but to leave the door open for him so we went up and i ran in his room and lighted his gas for him as i did every night when we went up together in a little while i heard him come in and go to his room i knew nothing then but next day going into mother's room i saw him standing before the glass door of her armoir looking at a black coat he had on involuntarily i cried out oh don't hal don't what is n't it a nice coat he asked yes but it is buttoned up to the throat and i don't like to see it it looks here i went out as abruptly as i came in that black coat so tightly buttoned troubled me he came to our room after a while and said he was going ten miles out in the country for a few days i begged him to stay and reproached him for going away so soon after he had come home but he said he must adding perhaps i am tired of you and want to see something new i'll be so glad to get back in a few days father said yes he must go so he went without any further explanation walking out to mr davidson's that evening lydia and i sat down on a fallen rail beyond the catholic graveyard and there she told me what had happened the night before sitting on dr woods's gallery with six or eight others who had been singing hal called on mr henderson to sing he complied by singing one that was not nice 1 old mr sparks got up to leave and hal said i hope we are not disturbing you no he said he was tired and would go home as soon as he was gone his son who i have since heard was under the influence of opium though hal always maintained that he was not said it was a shame to disturb his poor old father hal answered you heard what he said we did not disturb him you are a liar the other cried that is a name that none of our family has either merited or borne with and quick as thought hal sprang to his feet and struck him across the face with the walking stick he held the blow sent the lower part across the balcony in the street as the spring was loosened by it while the upper part to which was fastened the sword for it was father's sword cane remained in his hand i doubt that he ever before knew the cane could come apart certainly he did not perceive it until the other whined piteously he was taking advantage over an unarmed man when cursing him he harry threw it after the body of the cane and said now we are equal the other's answer was to draw a knife 1 and was about to plunge it into harry who disdained to flinch when mr henderson threw himself on mr sparks and dragged him off it was a little while after that harry came for us the consequence of this was a challenge from mr sparks in the morning which was accepted by harry's friends who appointed monday at greenwell to meet lydia did not tell me that she said she thought it had been settled peaceably so i was not uneasy and only wanted harry to come back from seth david's soon the possibility of his fighting never occurred to me sunday evening i was on the front steps with miriam and dr woods talking of harry and wishing he would come you want harry the doctor repeated after me you had better learn to live without him what an absurdity i said and wondered when he would come still later miriam father and i were in the parlor when there was a tap on the window just above his head and i saw a hand for an instant father hurried out and we heard several voices and then steps going away mother came down and asked who had been there but we only knew that whoever it was father had afterward gone with them mother went on there is something going on which is to be kept from me every one seems to know it and to make a secret of it i said nothing for i had promised lydia not to tell and even i did not know all when father came back harry was with him i saw by his nod and how are you girls how he wished us to take it so neither moved from our chairs while he sat down on the sofa and asked what kind of a sermon we had had and we talked of anything except what we were thinking of until we went upstairs hal afterwards told me that he had been arrested up there and father went with him to give bail and that the sheriff had gone out to greenwell after mr sparks he told me all about it next morning saying he was glad it was all over but sorry for mr sparks for he had a blow on his face which nothing would wash out i said hal if you had fought much as i love you i would rather he had killed you than that you should have killed him i love you too much to be willing to see blood on your hands first he laughed at me then said if i had killed him i never would have seen you again we thought it was all over so did he but baton rouge was wild about it mr sparks was the bully of the town having nothing else to do and whenever he got angry or drunk would knock down anybody he chose that same night before harry met him he had slapped one man and had dragged another over the room by the hair but these coolly went home and waited for a voluntary apology so the mothers sisters and intimate friends of those who had patiently borne the blows and being woolled vaunted the example of their heroes and asked why dr morgan had not acted as they had done and waited for an apology then there was another faction who cried only blood could wash out that blow and make a gentleman of mr sparks again as though he ever had been one so knots assembled at street corners and discussed it until father said to us that monday night these people are so excited and are trying so hard to make this affair worse that i would not be surprised if they shot each other down in the street speaking of harry and the other hal seemed to think of it no more though and wednesday said he must go to the city and consult brother as to where he should permanently establish himself i was sorry yet glad that he would then get away from all this trouble i don't know that i ever saw him in higher spirits than he was that day and evening the 24th lilly and charlie were here until late and he laughed and talked so incessantly that we called him crazy we might have guessed by his extravagant spirits that he was trying to conceal something from us he went away before daybreak and i never saw him again there is no word in the english language that can express the state in which we are and have been these last three days day before yesterday news came early in the morning of three of the enemy's boats passing the forts and then the excitement began it increased rapidly on hearing of the sinking of eight of our gunboats in the engagement the capture of the forts and last night of the burning of the wharves and cotton in the city while the yankees were taking possession to day the excitement has reached the point of delirium i believe i am one of the most self possessed in my small circle and yet i feel such a craving for news of miriam and mother and jimmy who are in the city that i suppose i am as wild as the rest it is nonsense to tell me i am cool with all these patriotic and enthusiastic sentiments nothing can be positively ascertained save that our gunboats are sunk and theirs are coming up to the city everything else has been contradicted until we really do not know whether the city has been taken or not we only know we had best be prepared for anything so day before yesterday lilly and i sewed up our jewelry which may be of use if we have to fly i vow i will not move one step unless carried away come what will here i remain we went this morning to see the cotton burning a sight never before witnessed and probably never again to be seen wagons drays everything that can be driven or rolled were loaded with the bales and taken a few squares back to burn on the commons negroes were running around cutting them open piling them up and setting them afire all were as busy as though their salvation depended on disappointing the yankees later charlie sent for us to come to the river and see him fire a flatboat loaded with the precious material for which the yankees are risking their bodies and souls up and down the levee as far as we could see negroes were rolling it down to the brink of the river where they would set them afire and push the bales in to float burning down the tide each sent up its wreath of smoke and looked like a tiny steamer puffing away only i doubt that from the source to the mouth of the river there are as many boats afloat on the mississippi the flatboat was piled with as many bales as it could hold without sinking most of them were cut open while negroes staved in the heads of barrels of alcohol whiskey etc and dashed bucketsful over the cotton others built up little chimneys of pine every few feet lined with pine knots and loose cotton to burn more quickly there piled the length of the whole levee or burning in the river lay the work of thousands of negroes for more than a year past it had come from every side men stood by who owned the cotton that was burning or waiting to burn they either helped or looked on cheerfully charlie owned but sixteen bales a matter of some fifteen hundred dollars but he was the head man of the whole affair and burned his own as well as the property of others a single barrel of whiskey that was thrown on the cotton cost the man who gave it one hundred and twenty five dollars it shows what a nation in earnest is capable of doing only two men got on the flatboat with charlie when it was ready it was towed to the middle of the river set afire in every place and then they jumped into a little skiff fastened in front and rowed to land the cotton floated down the mississippi one sheet of living flame even in the sunlight it would have been grand at night but then we will have fun watching it this evening anyway for they cannot get through to day though no time is to be lost hundreds of bales remained untouched an incredible amount of property has been destroyed to day but no one begrudges it every grog shop has been emptied and gutters and pavements are floating with liquors of all kinds so that if the yankees are fond of strong drink they will fare ill yesterday mr hutchinson and a dr moffat called to ask for me with a message about jimmy i was absent but they saw lilly jimmy they said was safe though sick in bed he had sprung up and had rushed to the wharf at the first tap of the alarm bell in new orleans but as nothing could be done he would probably be with us to day bringing mother and miriam i have neither heard nor seen more the mcrae they said went to the bottom with the others they did not know whether any one aboard had escaped god be praised that jimmy was not on her then the new boat to which he was appointed is not yet finished so he is saved i am distressed about captain huger and could not refrain from crying he was so good to jimmy but i remembered miss cammack might think it rather tender and obtrusive so i dried my eyes and began to hope he had escaped oh how glad i should be to know he has suffered no harm mr hutchinson was on his way above going to join others where the final battle is to be fought on the mississippi he had not even time to sit down so i was doubly grateful to him for his kindness i wish i could have thanked him for being so considerate of me in my distress now in her agitation lilly gave him a letter i had been writing to george when i was called away and begged him to address it and mail it at vicksburg or somewhere for no mail will leave here for norfolk for a long while to come the odd part is that he does not know george but he said he would gladly take charge of it and remember the address which lilly told him was richmond well if the yankees get it they will take it for an insane scrawl i wanted to calm his anxiety about us though i was so wildly excited that i could only say don't mind us we are safe but fight george fight for us the repetition was ludicrous i meant so much too i only wanted him to understand he could best defend us there ah mr yankee if you had but your brothers in this world and their lives hanging by a thread you too might write wild letters and if you want to know what an excited girl can do just call and let me show you the use of a small seven shooter and a large carving knife which vibrate between my belt and my pocket always ready for emergencies what a day last night came a dispatch that new orleans was under british protection and could not be bombarded consequently the enemy's gunboats would probably be here this morning such few as had succeeded in passing the forts from nine to fifteen it was said and the forts they said had not surrendered i went to church but i grew very anxious before it was over feeling that i was needed at home when i returned i found lilly wild with excitement picking up hastily whatever came to hand preparing for instant flight she knew not where the yankees were in sight the town was to be burned we were to run to the woods etc if the house had to be burned i had to make up my mind to run too so my treasure bag tied around my waist as a bustle a sack with a few necessary articles hanging on my arm some few quite unnecessary ones too as i had not the heart to leave the old and new prayer books father had given me and miriam's too pistol and carving knife ready i stood awaiting the exodus i heaped on the bed the treasures i wanted to burn matches lying ready to fire the whole at the last minute i may here say that when all was over i found i had omitted many things from the holocaust this very diary was not included it would have afforded vast amusement to the yankees there may yet be occasion to burn them and the house also people fortunately changed their minds about the auto da fé just then and the yankees have not yet arrived at sundown so when the excitement calmed down poor lilly tumbled in bed in a high fever in consequence of terror and exertion a page torn out i was right in that prophecy for this was not the will pinckney i saw last so woebegone so subdued careworn and sad no trace of his once merry self he is good looking which he never was before but i would rather never have seen him than have found him so changed i was talking to a ghost his was a sad story he had held one bank of the river until forced to retreat with his men as their cartridges were exhausted and general lovell omitted sending more they had to pass through swamps wading seven and a half miles up to their waists in water he gained the edge of the swamp saw they were over the worst and fell senseless two of his men brought him milk and woke him up he said his men fell from exhaustion were lost and died in the swamp so that out of five hundred but one hundred escaped this he told quietly and sadly looking so heartbroken that it was piteous to see such pain he showed me his feet with thick clumsy shoes which an old negro had pulled off to give him for his were lost in the swamp and he came out bare footed they reached the lafourche river i believe seized a boat and arrived here last night his wife and child were aboard heaven knows how they got there the men he sent on to port hudson while he stopped here i wanted to bring his wife to stay with us but he said she could not bear to be seen as she had run off just as she had happened to be at that moment in half an hour he would be off to take her to his old home in a carriage there he would rejoin his men on the railroad and march from clinton to the jackson road and so on to corinth a long journey for men so disheartened but they will conquer in the end beauregard's army will increase rapidly at this rate the whole country is aroused and every man who owns a gun and many who do not are on the road to corinth we will conquer yet
tuesday april 7th i believe that it is for true that we are to leave for new orleans via clinton and ponchatoula this evening clinton at least i am sure of lilly came down for me yesterday and according to the present programme though i will not answer for it in an hour from now we leave linwood this evening and clinton on thursday i am almost indifferent about our destination my chief anxiety is to have some definite plans decided on which seems perfectly impossible from the number of times they are changed a day the uncertainty is really affecting my spine and causing me to grow alarmingly thin wednesday clinton april 8th 1863 our last adieux are said and linwood is left behind it may be for years and it may be forever my last hours were spent lying on the sofa on the gallery with lydia at my feet helen carter sitting on the floor at my side while all the rest were gathered around me as i played for the last time the centre of attraction i grew almost lachrymose as i bid a last adieu to the bed where i have spent so many months as they carried me downstairs wonder if it will not miss me it must have been at least five before the cars returned mrs carter grew quite pathetic as they approached while poor little lydia with streaming eyes and choking sobs clung first to miriam and then to me as though we parted to meet only in eternity all except her mother started in a run for the big gate while i was carried to the buggy through the group of servants gathered to say good bye when the general drove me off rapidly what a delightful sensation is motion after five months inaction the last time i was in a vehicle was the night general beale's ambulance brought me to linwood a helpless bundle last november it seemed to me yesterday that i could again feel the kind gentleman's arm supporting me and his wondering sympathetic tone as he repeated every half mile really miss morgan you are very patient and uncomplaining good kind president miller as though all the trouble was not his just then but stopping at the gate roused me from my short reverie and i opened my eyes to find myself stationary and in full view of a train of cars loaded with soldiers literally covered with them for they covered the roof as well as filled the interior while half a dozen open cars held them seated one above the other in miniature pyramids and even the engine was graced by their presence abashed with finding myself confronted with so many people my sensation became decidedly alarming as a dozen rude voices cried go on we won't stop and a chorus of the opposition cried yes we will no yes they cried in turn and as the general stood me on the ground i would have walked if it had been my last attempt in life i paused irresolute not knowing whether to advance or retreat before the storm i must say they are the only rude soldiers i have yet seen in confederate uniforms but as i walked slowly clinging to the general's arm half from fear and half from weakness they ceased the unnecessary dispute and remained so quiet that i was more frightened still and actually forgot to say good bye to mrs carter and mrs worley as they stood by the road how both the general and i escaped being hurt as he raised me on the platform every one is at a loss to account for i experienced only what may be called slight pain in comparison to what i have felt but really fear that the exertion has disabled him for to day it must have been very severe some officers led me to my seat lilly miriam and anna got in the general kissed us heartily with damp eyes and kind wishes the cars gave a whistle and i put my head out of the window to see mrs carter industriously applying white cambric to her face which occupation she relinquished to call out last good byes another whistle and a jerk and we were off leaving her and mrs worley surrounded by children and servants using their handkerchiefs to wipe tears and wave farewell while the general waved his hat for good bye then green hedges rapidly changing took their place and linwood was out of sight before we had ceased saying and thinking god bless the kind hearts we had left behind can i ever forget the kindness we have met among them to see green trees and wild flowers once more after such an illness is a pleasure that only those long deprived of such beauties by a similar misfortune can fully appreciate it was a relief to discover that what i had thought shocking rudeness in the soldiers had not been reserved for me alone for every time we stopped the same cry of no waiting for slow people was raised varied by constant expostulations with the engine for drinking ponds dry and mild suggestions as to taking the road the other side of the fence which would no doubt prove smoother than the track these arkansas troops have acquired a reputation for roughness and ignorance which they seem to cultivate as assiduously as most people would their virtues but rudeness does not affect their fighting qualities madisonville sunday april 12th 1863 we arrived here about five last evening and strange to say the journey fatiguing as it was has not altogether disabled me but i must go back to clinton to account for this new change it would never do to take more than a hundred miles at a single jump without speaking of the incidents by the way numerous and pleasant as they were some way they have unaccountably paled and things that seemed so extremely amusing and afforded me so much pleasure during these four days now seem to be absurd trifles half forgotten i now remember lying in state on lilly's bed wednesday talking to mrs badger who had been several days in town anna sarah ripley and the others when frank suddenly bolted in just from port hudson to say another good bye though i told him good bye at linwood sunday presently the general entered just from linwood to see us off then mr marston and his daughter and mr neafus all as kind as possible until a perfect levee was assembled which i iying all dressed with a shawl thrown over me enjoyed all the more as i could take my ease and have my fun at the same time frank sitting by my pillow talked dolorously of how much he would miss us and threatened to be taken prisoner before long in order to see us again when we were finally left alone i fancy there was very little sleep in the house as to me i lay by lilly wide awake thinking how lonely she would be without us and perfectly désolée at the idea of leaving the confederacy the dear gray coats included so when it was almost sunrise there was no necessity of rousing me to dress as i was only too glad to leave my sleepless bed before i got dressed anna her mother and sarah ripley came in again then miss comstock and just as i had put the last touch to my dress the gentlemen of the night before entered and we had almost an hour and a half's respite before the carriage less punctual than we drove to the door the general picked me up in his arms and carried me once more to the carriage then the servants had to say good bye then lilly very quiet very red and dissolved in tears clung to me almost without a word hardly able to speak whilst i distressed and grieved as i was had not a tear in my eyes nothing but a great lump in my throat that i tried to choke down in order to talk to frank who stood at the window by me after she left how the distance lengthens between us i raise up from my pillows and find myself at camp moore at four o'clock forty miles are passed over good bye frank from camp moore we had to go three miles back to find captain gilman's house where we were expected the gentleman is a friend of gibbes though i had never seen any of them before such a delightful place with everything looking so new and cool and such a hospitable hostess that i thought everything charming in spite of my fatigue i had hardly a moment to look around for immediately we were shown to our rooms and in a very few minutes miriam had me undressed and in bed the most delightful spot in the world to me just then while congratulating myself on having escaped death on the roadside i opened my eyes to behold a tray brought to my bedside with a variety of refreshments coffee bread loaf sugar preserves i opened my mouth to make an exclamation at the singular optical illusion but wisely forbore speaking and shut it with some of the unheard of delicacies instead early next morning the same routine was gone through as thursday morning again the carriage drove to the door and we were whisked off to camp moore where the engine stood snorting with impatience to hurry us off to ponchatoula soon we were steaming down the track i reclining on my pillows in an interesting state of invalidism sadly abashed now and then at the courteous wondering gaze of the soldiers who were aboard having very little idea of the geography of that part of the country and knowing we were to take a carriage from some point this side of ponchatoula fancying how surprised mr halsey would be to hear we had passed him on the way i took a card from my traveling case and wrote a few words for good bye as we could not see him again i sealed it up and put it in my pocket to send to the first post office we passed about twelve o'clock we stopped at hammond which was our place to disembark mother sent out to hire a negro to carry me off the platform and while waiting in great perplexity a young officer who had just seated himself before me got up and asked if he could assist her seizing an arm full of cloaks as he spoke i got up and walked to the door to appear independent and make believe i was not the one when mother begged him not to trouble himself she wanted a man to assist her daughter who was sick calling a friend the gentleman kindly loaded him with the cloaks etc while he hurried out after me i was looking ruefully at the impracticable step which separated me from the platform the question of how i was to carry out my independent notions began to perplex me allow me to assist you said a voice at my elbow i turned and beheld the handsome officer thank you i think i can get down alone pray allow me to lift you over this place much obliged but your arm will suffice sarah let the gentleman carry you you know you cannot walk said my very improper mother i respectfully declined the renewed offer don't pay any attention to her pick her up just as you would a child said my incorrigible mother the gentleman turned very red while miriam asserts i turned extremely white the next thing i knew by passing his arm around my waist or taking me by my arms i was so frightened that i have but a confused idea of it i was lifted over the intervening gulf and landed on the platform hammond boasts of four houses one a shoe manufactory stood about twenty or thirty yards off and there the gentleman proposed to conduct me again he insisted on carrying me and resolutely refusing i pronounced myself fully equal to the walk and accepting his proffered arm walked off with dignity and self possession he must have fancied that the injury was in my hand for holding my arm so that my entire weight must have been thrown on him not satisfied with that support with his other hand he held mine so respectfully and so carefully that i could not but smile as it struck me which by the way was not until i reached the house discovering that he belonged to colonel simonton's command i asked him to take mr halsey the note i had written an hour before he pronounced himself delighted to be of the slightest service and seeing that we were strangers traveling unprotected asked if we had secured a conveyance to take us beyond we told him no he modestly suggested that some gentleman might attend to it for us he would be happy to do anything in his power i thought again of mr halsey and said if he would mention we were in hammond he would be kind enough to see to it for us may i ask your name he asked evidently surprised to find himself asking a question he was dying to know i gave him my card whereupon mother asked his name which he told us was howard we had been talking for some ten minutes when feeling rather uncomfortable at being obliged to look up at such a tall man from my low seat to relieve my neck as well as to shade my face from any further scrutiny i put down my head while i was still speaking instantly so quietly naturally and unobtrusively did he stoop down by me on one knee so that his face was in full view of mine that the action did not seem to me either singular or impertinent in fact i did not think of it until mother spoke of it after he left after a few moments it must have struck him for he got up and made his parting bow departing as i afterwards heard to question tiche as to how i had been hurt and declaring that it was a dreadful calamity to happen to so lovely a young lady monday april 13th having nothing to do i may as well go on with the history of our wanderings when the cars were moving off with the handsome mr howard mother turned to a gentleman who seemed to own the place and asked to be shown the hotel he went out and presently returning with a chair and two negroes quietly said he would take us to his own house the hotel was not comfortable and without listening to remonstrances led the way to a beautiful little cottage where he introduced his wife mrs cate who received us most charmingly and had me in bed before five minutes had elapsed i don't know how any one can believe the whole world so wicked for my part i have met none but the kindest people imaginable i don't know any wicked ones before half an hour had passed a visitor was announced so i gathered up my weary bones and with scarcely a peep at the glass walked to the parlor i commenced laughing before i got there and the visitor smiled most absurdly too for it was mr halsey it seemed so queer to meet in this part of the world that we laughed again after shaking hands it was odd i was thinking how much amused the general would be to hear of it for he had made a bet that we would meet when i asserted that we would not after the first few remarks he told me of how he had heard of our arrival a gentleman had walked into camp asking if a mr halsey was there he signified that he was the gentleman whereupon the other drew out my note saying a young lady on the cars had requested him to deliver it instantly recognizing the chirography he asked where i was hammond this is her name replied the other extending to him my card thinking as he modestly confessed that i had intended it only for him mr halsey coolly put it into his pocket and called for his horse mr howard lingered still apparently having something to say which he found difficult to put in words at last as the other prepared to ride off with a tremendous effort he managed to say the young lady's card is mine if it is all the same to you i should like to have it returned apologizing for the mistake mr halsey returned it feeling rather foolish i should imagine and rode on to the village leaving as he avers mr howard looking enviously after the lucky dog who was going to see such a young lady he told me something that slightly disgusted me with captain bradford it was that when he reached the bivouac the next morning after leaving linwood the captain had put him under arrest for having stayed there all night it was too mean considering that it is more than probable that he himself remained at mrs fluker's we discovered too that we had missed two letters mr halsey had written us which of course is a great disappointment one written to both the other a short note of ten pages for me which i am sure was worth reading it was not until after sunset that we exhausted all topics of conversation and mr halsey took his leave promising to see us in the morning and to be sure as soon as i was dressed on saturday he again made his appearance followed soon after by the carriage taking a cordial leave of mrs cate with many thanks for her hospitality we entered our conveyance and with mr halsey riding by the side of the carriage went on our way he was to accompany us only as far as ponchatoula some six miles but the turning point in his journey seemed to be an undetermined spot for mile after mile rolled away rather the wheels rolled over them and still he rode by us talking through the window and the sprays of wild flowers he would pick for me from time to time were growing to quite a bouquet when he proposed an exchange with the farmer who was driving us and giving him his horse took the reins himself i think miriam and i will always remember that ride the laughter the conversation the songs with the murmuring accompaniment of the wheels and a thousand incidents pleasant to remember though foolish to speak of will always form a delightful tableau in our recollections i have but one disagreeable impression to remember in connection with the trip and that occurred at a farmhouse two miles from here where we stopped to get strawberries i preferred remaining in the carriage to the trouble of getting out so all went in mr halsey dividing his time equally between miriam in the house and me in the carriage supplying me with violets and pensées one moment and the next showing me the most tempting strawberries at the most provoking distance assuring me they were exquisite the individual to whom the carriage belonged who had given up the reins to mr halsey and who no doubt was respectable enough for his class in his part of the country would allow no one to bring me my strawberries reserving the honor for himself presently he appeared with a large saucer of them covered with cream i was naturally thankful but would have preferred his returning to the house after he had fulfilled his mission instead he had the audacity to express his admiration of my personal appearance without a pause gave me a short sketch of his history informed me he was a widower and very anxious to marry again and finally lares and penates of the house of morgan ap kerrig veil your affronted brows you will scarcely credit that the creature had the insolence to say that he would marry me to morrow if he could and think himself blessed for the jewel of the soul must be equal to the casket that contained it yes this brute of a man had the unparalleled audacity to speak to me in such a way just then mother remembering her invalid came to the gallery and asked how i was enjoying my lunch i'm courting her cried the wretch glad she did not go in swear she's the prettiest girl i ever saw at that moment mr halsey came sauntering out with a handful of violets for me and turning my shoulder to the creature i entered into a lively discussion with him and at last had the satisfaction of seeing the wretch enter the house a drive through the straggling half deserted town brought us here to mrs greyson's a large old fashioned looking house so close to the tchefuncta i think that is the name of the river that i could throw a stone in it from my bed almost a ride of twenty six miles bolt upright in the carriage over such bad roads had almost used me up i retired to bed in a state of collapse leaving miriam to entertain mr halsey alone after supper though i managed to put on my prettiest dress and be carried down to the parlor where i rejoined the rest several strange ladies were present one of whom has since afforded me a hearty laugh she was a horrid looking woman and ten minutes after i entered crossing the room with a most laughable look of vulgarity attempting to ape righteous scorn jerked some articles of personal property from the table and retired with the sweep of a small hurricane i thought her an eccentric female but what was my amazement yesterday to hear that she sought mrs greyson told her it was impossible for her to stay among so many elegantly dressed ladies and that she preferred keeping her room next day she told her that she was entirely too attentive to us and rather than be neglected in that way for other people would leave the house which she did instantly there was a singular assembly of odd characters in the parlor saturday night six of whom looked as though they were but so many reflections of the same individual in different glasses and the seventh differed from the rest only in playing exquisitely on the banjo too well to be a gentleman i fear these were soldiers come to call on us half an hour after we arrived a dozen of them took possession of the bench on the bank of the river one with his banjo who played and sang delightfully old mrs greyson who is rather eccentric called ah mr j have you heard already of the arrival of the young ladies you never serenaded me the young man naturally looked foolish so she went out and asked him to come around after dark and play for the young ladies so after a while he came bringing six devils yet worse than himself as the old scriptural phrase has it all of whom sat on the same side of the room and looked at us steadily when they thought we were not looking all had the same voice the same bow the same manner that is to say none at all of the latter one introduced an agreeable variety saying as he bowed to each separately happy to make your acquaintance ma'am mr halsey just managed to keep his face straight while i longed for a dickens to put them all together and make one amusing picture out of the seven i troubled myself very little about them preferring mr halsey's company not knowing when we would meet again it would not have been quite fair to leave him to himself after he had ridden such a distance for us so i generously left the seven to miriam content with one and rather think i had the best of the bargain the one with the banjo suggested that we should sing for them before he played for us so miriam played on the piano and sang with me on the guitar half a dozen songs and then the other commenced i don't know when i have been more amused there was an odd piney woods dash about him that was exceedingly diverting and he went through comic sentimental and original songs with an air that showed his whole heart was in it judging from the number of youth too timid to venture in who peeped at us from the windows i should say that young ladies are curiosities just now in madisonville tuesday april 14th ah another delightful glimpse of society has been offered to our charmed view such a treat has not often fallen to our lot good mrs greyson in her anxiety to make all around her happy determined we should have a dance i should say miriam for mrs bull and mrs ivy never indulge in such amusements and i can't so it must have been for miriam alone such a crew the two ladies above mentioned and i almost laughed ourselves into hysterics poor miriam with a tall slender texan who looked as though he had chopped wood all his life moved through the dance like the lady in comus only now and then a burst of laughter at the odd mistakes threatened to overcome her dignity we who were fortunately exempt from the ordeal laughed unrestrainedly at the mêlée one danced entirely with his arms his feet had very little to do with the time one hopped through with a most dolorous expression of intense absorption in the arduous task another never changed a benign smile that had appeared on entering but preserved it unimpaired through every accident one female apparently of the tender age of thirty wore a yellow muslin with her hair combed rigidly à la chinoise and tightly fastened at the back of her head in a knot whose circumference must have been fully equal to that of a dollar in addition to other charms she bore her neck and chin in a very peculiar manner as though she were looking over the fence mr christmas remarked mr christmas had ridden all the way from ponchatoula to see us and if it had not been for him mr worthington and dr capdevielle who came in after a while i think i should have expired and even miriam would have given up in despair the doctor was an old friend of harry's though we never met him before thursday april 16th mr halsey brought us each a little tortoise shell ring he had made for us by his camp fire as a keepsake and of course we promised to wear them for him particularly as they make our hands look as white as possible towards sunset in spite of prayers and entreaties from miriam who insisted that i was too feeble to attempt it i insisted on walking out to the bench by the river to enjoy the cool breeze and was rather glad i had come when soon after dr capdevielle made his appearance with two beautiful bouquets which he presented with his french bow to us and introducing his friend mr miltonberger entered into one of those lively discussions about nothing which frenchmen know how to make so interesting no sooner had they left than to our infinite surprise the immortal seven of saturday night walked in wonder what fun they find in coming i see none for we rarely trouble ourselves about their presence there are but two i have addressed as yet one because i am forced to say yes or no to his remarks and the other because i like his banjo which he brought again and feel obliged to talk occasionally since he is so accommodating and affords me the greatest amusement with his comic songs i was about retiring unceremoniously about twelve o'clock completely worn out when they finally bethought themselves of saying good night and saved me the necessity of being rude wonder if that is all the fun they have i should say it was rather dry it is mean to laugh at them though their obliging dispositions should save them from our ridicule last evening mr halsey succeeded in procuring a large skiff whereupon four or five of them offered to row and took us way down the tchefuncta through the most charming scenery to a spot where echo answered us in the most remarkable way her distinct utterance was really charming not being aware of the secret i thought the first answer to the halloo was from pickets mr halsey has a magnificent voice and the echoes came back so full and rich that soon we appointed him speaker by mutual consent and were more than repaid by the delightful sounds that came from the woods the last ray of the sun on the smooth waters the soldiers resting on their oars while we tuned the guitar and sang in the still evening until twilight slowly closing over warned us to return forms another of those pictures indescribable though never to be forgotten bonfouca saturday april 18th when i paused on thursday to rest a few moments how little idea i had that the rest i was taking would soon be required for another journey it was agreed among us with our fellow travelers mrs bull and mrs ivy whom we met at mrs greyson's endeavoring to reach the city like ourselves that we would wait there until we could receive our passports from general pemberton when this journey was first seriously contemplated miriam wrote to colonel szymanski representing mother's state of health and my unfortunate condition the necessity of medical advice for both and the impossibility of remaining in famishing clinton and asked him to apply to the general for a pass to go to brother the colonel sent word through eugene la noue that we should obtain it in a few days and advised us to go by way of ponchatoula tired of delay and hearing that we could pass as readily on general gardiner's order we obtained one and started off without waiting for the other the first news on arriving at madisonville was that no one should pass except on general pemberton's order pleasant intelligence for those who had come that far without the other two ladies were in the same dilemma they were told that they should have a pass if they would wait waiting at the expense of four dollars a day for each mrs ivy with two very sick babies mrs bull with all her property in new orleans at stake tiche with her broken foot mother with a powerless hand and i with an injured spine was anything but agreeable under the circumstances though nothing could be more pleasant apart from this sense of restriction than our stay at madisonville general pemberton took his leisure about the affair which is not surprising as our generals have more weighty matters than women's passports to attend to still pleased as we were with our residence there it was necessary to get on as soon as possible so as i rested from labors about one o'clock on thursday mrs bull came in to suggest a new plan to mother it was to leave immediately for a plantation called bonfouca thirty miles off where schooners came twice a week and where we would be allowed to embark without a pass carriages that had just brought a party of ladies from mandeville were waiting on the other side of the river which could take us off immediately for there was not a moment to lose instantly we resolved to hazard the undertaking about three we got into the large scow to cross the tchefuncta in a party numbering five ladies four children and four servants one of the devoted pickets after setting me carefully in the most comfortable place asked permission to accompany me as far as the carriage he was sure he could assist me more carefully than the drivers and without further parley he followed before we turned the point mr worthington 1 the dim distance rowing up the stream in the direction of madisonville what if he had perceived us and was hastening after us deeming it his duty to arrest us for trying to get away without general pemberton's order as the idea was suggested there was rather a nervous set of ladies on board the half mile that we had to go before reaching our landing place was passed over in nervous apprehension at last the spot was reached mr worthington had not appeared and we reached terra firma without being nabbed as we confidently expected the obliging picket put me into the carriage bade me a most friendly adieu and returned to the village leaving us with every prospect of getting off without serious difficulty in spite of our serious apprehensions with two little children and tiche with me our carriage started off some time before the others two or three miles from our starting point i perceived three gentlemen riding towards us one of whom i instantly recognized as dr capdevielle instantly i stopped the carriage to speak to him his look of astonishment when satisfied of my identity rather amused me but my amusement was changed to a slight feeling of disappointment when he commenced talking was it possible i was leaving madison oh how distressed he was he was promising himself so much pleasure and to leave so unexpectedly he had just come with his friends from somewhere they had planned a surprise party at mrs greyson's for us that evening and had been after the supper they had procured somewhere as i before observed and were just now returning and now we were deserting them he had invited monsieur berger monsieur pollock monsieur mais enfin des messieurs he exclaimed with a comical emphasis and smile that brought vivid recollections of the other party before my eyes by force of contrast i suppose and was n't i sorry we had left we fairly condoled with each other twenty minutes had elapsed before i had so far recovered from the disappointment as to bethink myself of the propriety of continuing my journey and then with the assurance of being mutually désolé we parted with a hearty good bye and he rode on to rejoin his companions while i went the way he had come two miles beyond i met three others of the six gentlemen he had mentioned riding in a little dogcart which contained champagne baskets in which the supper was evidently packed each gentleman elegantly dressed holding between them a little basket of bouquets that my prophetic soul told me was intended for miriam and me i was not personally acquainted with the gentlemen or i should have told them of the disappointment that awaited them it must have been a disappointment in the midst of profound reflections about fate vanity of human wishes and calculations friendships formed on the roadside in the journey through life or from clinton i raised my eyes to behold lake ponchartrain and to find myself in mandeville just seven miles from the tchefuncta looking at the dreary expanse of water which suggested loneliness and desolation first recalled my own situation to me here i was in this straggling place with tiche a cripple like myself and two little children under my care without an idea of where we were to go any one as timid and dependent as i to be placed in such a position as pioneer to such a tremendous company would feel rather forlorn but some step had to be taken so i consulted the driver as to where we could obtain board and followed his suggestion one house after the other we stopped at and with my veil down and my heart beating as though i were soliciting charity or some other unpleasant favor i tried to engage rooms for the company without success at last we were directed to a frenchman who after the usual assurance of nothing to eat which we afterwards found to be only too true consented to receive us taking possession seemed to me such a dreadful responsibility that for some time i remained in the carriage afraid to get out before the others arrived but there was still no sign of them so i gathered my children and tiche and prepared to dismount with the frenchman's assistance i have read descriptions of such houses and people but i have not often seen them the man and his wife were perfect specimens of the low canadian speaking only french no sooner had they discovered that i was blessée as they supposed than each seized an arm and with overwhelming exclamations of sympathy halfway dragged me into the room where they thrust me into a chair their family seemed to consist only of cats and dogs who seemed to agree most harmoniously and each of whom conceived the liveliest affection for us as we were leaving mrs greyson's a stranger just from the city brought to our room a paper of ham tongue and biscuits for the sick young lady heaven only knows how she heard of her saying she had just traveled the road herself and knew i would find nothing to eat so she would insist on putting this in our basket it was done in a manner that put all refusal out of the question so it had to be accepted i was feeding little jenny ivy and minna bull on this lunch for want of something else to do when the affection of the cats and dogs became overpowering six of them jumped at us licked jenny's face eat minna's ham and what with sundry kicks and slaps i had exercise enough to last a week and was rapidly losing all my strength when the woman came to my rescue and called her pets off just as the rest of the party drove up to find me almost exhausted such a bedroom there was a narrow single bed in which mother jenny and i slept a decrepit table on which stood a diseased mirror a broken lounge without a bottom and a pine armoir filled with corn in the centre stood the chief ornament a huge pile of dirt near which miriam's mattress was placed while the sail of a boat flanked it in on the other side arranged as a bed for tiche the accommodations in the other bedroom were far inferior to ours then the mosquitoes swarmed like pandemonium on a spree and there was but one bar in the house which the man declared should be only for me i would rather have been devoured by the insects than enjoy comforts denied to the others so i made up my mind it should be the last time our supper was rare nothing like it was ever seen in paris as mcclellan would say it consisted of one egg apiece with a small spoonful of rice a feast you see price one dollar each besides the dollar paid for the privilege of sleeping among dirt dogs and fleas sunday april 19th friday morning we arose and prepared to resume our journey for bonfouca twenty three miles away the man walked in very unceremoniously to get corn from the armoir as we got up throwing open the windows and performing sundry little offices usually reserved for femmes de chambre but with that exception everything went on very well breakfast being a luxury not to be procured we got into the carriages before sunrise and left this romantic abode of dogs and contentment again our road lay through piney woods so much like that from hammond to ponchatoula that involuntarily i found myself looking through the window to see if mr halsey was there it lacked only his presence to make the scene all in all the same but alas this time the driver picked me wild flowers and brought us haws mr halsey in blissful ignorance of our departure was many and many a mile away the drive was not half as amusing the horse would not suffer any one except miriam to drive and at last refused to move until the driver got down and ran along by the carriage every time the poor boy attempted to occupy his seat the obstinate animal would come to a dead stop and refuse to go until he dismounted again i am sure that he walked nineteen miles out of the twenty three out of complaisance to the ungrateful brute all equally fatigued and warm we reached this place about twelve o'clock mrs bull had arrived before us and as the carriage stopped her girl delia came to the gate the personification of despair crying you can't get out ladies they say we can't stop here we must go right back the panic which ensued is indescribable go back when we were almost at our journey's end after all the money we had spent the fatigue we had undergone to be turned back all the way to clinton perhaps with my sick babies cried mrs ivy with my sick child cried mother never you may turn me out of your house but we will die in the woods first to go back is to kill my daughter and these babies this was to the overseer who came to the carriage madam i have orders to allow no one to pass who has not written permission lieutenant worthington sent the order two days ago and i am liable to imprisonment if i harbor those who have no passport the man explained but we have general gardiner's order i expostulated then you shall certainly pass but these ladies cannot i can't turn you away though you shall all come in and stay until something can be determined on this much granted was an unlooked for blessing he showed us the way to a large unfurnished house one room of which contained a bed with one naked mattress which was to be our apartment mrs bull sat down in a calm dignified state of despair little mrs ivy dissolved in tears we all felt equally disconsolate the prospect of getting off was not so pleasant when we thought we should be obliged to leave them behind our common misfortunes had endeared us to each other strangers as we were a week ago so we all lamented together a perfect jérémiade of despair the overseer is very tenderhearted he condoled comforted and finally determined that if there was any way of getting them off they should go a glimpse of sunshine returned to our lowering sky and cheerfulness reigned once more to be violently dethroned some hours later three of the madisonville pickets were announced approaching the house of course they were coming after us oh that vile mr worthington we always did hate him there was such a sneaky look about him hypocrite we always felt we should hate him oh the wretch i won't go back cried mother i shall not said quiet mrs bull he shall pay my expenses if he insists on taking me back exclaimed mrs ivy spent all my money mrs bull you have none to lend me remember and mrs morgan shan't oh that worthington let s make him pay for all we smothered our laughter to sit trembling within as the pickets stepped on the gallery i believe we commenced praying just think thus far our journey has cost mother two hundred and twenty dollars it would cost the same to get back to blessed clinton and fancy our spending that sum to settle there again besides we gave away all our clothes to our suffering friends and what would we do there now after half an hour of painful suspense we discovered that it would have been as well to spare poor mr worthington for the pickets were not after us but had come to escort mrs r a woman who was taking the body of her son who was killed at murfreesboro to the city for interment poor woman she rode all this distance sitting on her child's coffin her husband was one of those who with b stole that large sum of money from father which came so near ruining him she speaks of her husband as of a departed saint i dare say she believes him innocent of the theft in spite of his public confession the grave has wiped out even the disgrace of the penitentiary where he expiated his offense when i told tiche who the woman was she clasped her hands saying the lord is good years and years master suffered while she grew rich and now her time comes the lord don't forget i can't feel that way it is well for the narrow minded to look for god's judgment on us for our sins but mine is a more liberal faith god afflicted her for some wise purpose but if i thought it was to avenge father i should be afraid of her as it is i can be sorry oh so sorry for her as usual i find myself taken care of at the expense of the others there are but two bars on the place one the overseer said should be for me the other for the children sheets were scarce covers scarcer still tired of being spoiled in this way i insisted on being allowed to sleep on a mattress on the floor after a vigorous skirmish with mother and miriam in which i came off victorious for a bar i impressed miriam's grenadine dress which she fastened to the doorknob and let fall over me à la victoria tester arrangement to my share fell a double blanket which as tiche had no cover i unfolded and as she used the foot of my bed for a pillow gave her the other end of it thus tell it not in yankeeland for it will never be credited actually sleeping under the same bedclothes with our black shiny negro nurse we are grateful though even for these discomforts it might have been so much worse indeed i fear that our fellow travelers do not fare as well those who have sheets have no bars those who have blankets have no sheets and one woman who has recently joined us has nothing except a mattress which is to do the duty of all three but then we got bread real pure wheat bread and coffee none of your potato burnt sugar and parched corn abomination but the unadulterated berry i can't enjoy it fully though every mouthful is cloyed with the recollection that lilly and her children have none as usual as mrs greyson says the flowers follow us yesterday i received three bouquets and miriam got one too in this out of the way place such offerings are unexpected and these were doubly gratifying coming from people one is not accustomed to receiving them from for instance the first was from the overseer the second from a servant and the third from a poor boy for whom we have subscribed to pay his passage to the city wednesday april 22d new orleans yesterday we arrived i thought we should never get here monday we had almost given up in despair believing the schooner would never return but in the evening when all were gathered in our room discussing our hopes and fears a sail was perceived at the mouth of the bayou whereupon every one rushed out to see the boat land i believe that i have not mentioned that this bonfouca is on a bayou of the same name that runs within a few yards of this house it is an indian name signifying winding river which struck us as very appropriate when we watched the schooner sailing now to the left now to the right apparently through the green fields for the high grass hid the course of the stream so that the faintest line was not perceptible except just in front of the house all was now bustle and confusion packing dressing and writing last words to our friends at home until half past eleven when we embarked this is my first experience of schooners and i don't care if i never behold another the cabin where mr kennedy immediately carried me was just the size of my bed at home in the days i had a home and just high enough to stand in on each side of the short ladder there was a mattress two feet wide one of them mrs r had possession of already the other was reserved for me i gave the lower part of mine to minna and jennie who spent the rest of the night fighting each other and kicking me just before twelve we weighed anchor and i went on deck to take a last look at dixie with the rest of the party every heart was full each left brothers sisters husband children or dear friends behind we sang farewell dear land with a slight quaver in our voices looked at the beautiful starlight shining on the last boundary of our glorious land and fervently and silently praying passed out of sight god bless you all you dear ones we have left in our beloved country god bless and prosper you and grant you the victory in the name of jesus christ i returned to my mattress and this is the way we spent the night mrs r rocking and moaning as she sat up in bed whined out her various ills with a minute description of each ceasing the recital only to talk of her son's body which lay on deck yesterday morning she was sitting crying on his coffin while a strange woman sat on its head eating her bread and cheese mrs bull one of the most intelligent and refined ladies i have yet met who is perfectly devoted to me sat by me laughing and talking trying her best to make every one comfortable and happy in her unobtrusive way mother talked to mrs r and cried at the thought of leaving her children fighting and suffering the space between the two beds was occupied by three irishwomen and mrs ivy's two babies the babies had commenced screaming as they were brought into the pen at which i was not surprised having pitched their voices on the proper key they never ceased shrieking kicking crying throwing up and going through the whole list of baby performances the nurses scolded with shrill voices above the bedlam that had hushed even mrs r s complaints jennie and minna quarreled kicked and cried and as an aggravation to the previous discomforts a broad shouldered perspiring irishwoman sat just by my head bracing herself against my pillow in the most unpleasant style i endured it without flinching until about half past three when the condensed odor of a dozen different people and children became unendurable and i staggered up on deck where miriam and mrs ivy had been wise enough to remain without venturing below they laid me on a bench in the stern rolled me up in shawls to keep off the heavy dew and there i remained until daylight with them as wide awake as ever at daylight there was a universal smoothing of heads and straightening of dresses besides arrangements made for the inspection of baggage being unwilling for any christian to see such a book as this i passed a piece of tape through the centre leaves and made miriam tie it under her hoops at sunrise we were in sight of the houses at the lake end it seemed as though we would never reach land i forgot to speak of our alarm as we got in the lake no sooner had we fairly left the bayou than the sky suddenly became threatening the captain shook his head and spoke of a very ugly night for the lake which sent everybody's heart to their throats and alarmed us immeasurably we got talking of the sailor's superstition of crossing the water with a corpse until we persuaded ourselves that it was more than probable we would founder in the coming storm but the severest storm we met was the one in the cabin and all night the only wind was a head breeze and the spicy gale from below when we at last entered the canal i beheld the animal now so long unseen the yankee in their dark blue uniforms they stood around but i thought of the dear gray coats and even the pickets of madisonville seemed nobler and greater men than these immediately a guard was placed on board we whispering before he came our dear confederates god bless them we had agreed among ourselves that come what would we would preserve our dignity and self respect and do anything rather than create a scene among such people it is well that we agreed so we whispered quietly among ourselves exhorting each other to pay no attention to the remarks the yankees made about us as we passed and acting the martyr to perfection until we came to hickock's landing here there was a group of twenty yankees two officers came up and asked us for papers we said we had none in five minutes one came back and asked if we had taken the oath no we had never taken any he then took down our names mother was alone in the coop he asked if there was not another the schooner had fifteen passengers and we had given only fourteen names mother then came up and gave her name going back soon after while one went after our passes others came to examine our baggage i could not but smile as an unfortunate young man got on his knees before our trunk and respectfully handled our dirty petticoats and stockings you have gone through it before he said of course the confederates searched it indeed they did not touch it i exclaimed they never think of doing such work miss it is more mortifying to me than it can be to you he answered and i saw he was actually blushing he did his work as delicately as possible and when he returned the keys asked if we had letters i opened my box and put them into his hand one came near getting me into serious trouble it was sent by some one i never saw with the assurance that it contained nothing objectionable i gave it sealed to the man who opened it when it proved to be rather disagreeable i judged from his language he told me his captain must see it before he could let me have it and carried it off presently he came back and told me it could not be returned i told him to burn it then as i neither knew the writer the contents nor those it was written to i may save you some difficulty if i destroy it he remarked whereupon he tore it up and flung it into the canal i have since found i had cause to be grateful for just after came an officer to see the young lady who brought that letter i showed the pieces in the water saying the young man had torn it up which seemed to annoy him it was to be sent to headquarters he said then came a bundle of papers on board carried by another who standing in front of us cried in a startling way sarah morgan here very quietly stand up i cannot firmly why not unable decisively after this brief dialogue he went on with the others until all were standing except myself when he delivered to each a strip of paper that informed the people that miss or mrs so and so had taken and subscribed the oath as citizen of the united states i thought that was all and rejoiced at our escape but after another pause he uncovered his head and told us to hold up our right hands half crying i covered my face with mine and prayed breathlessly for the boys and the confederacy so that i heard not a word he was saying until the question so help you god struck my ear i shuddered and prayed harder there came an awful pause in which not a lip was moved each felt as though in a nightmare until throwing down his blank book the officer pronounced it all right strange to say i experienced no change i prayed as hard as ever for the boys and our country and felt no nasty or disagreeable feeling which would have announced the process of turning yankee then it was that mother commenced he turned to the mouth of the diminutive cave and asked if she was ready to take the oath i suppose i have to since i belong to you she replied no madam you are not obliged we force no one can you state your objections yes i have three sons fighting against you and you have robbed me beggard me she exclaimed launching into a speech in which heaven knows what she did not say there was little she left out from her despoiled house to her sore hand both of which she attributed to the at first amiable man who was rapidly losing all patience faint with hunger dizzy with sleeplessness she had wrought on her own feelings until her nerves were beyond control she was determined to carry it out and crying and sobbing went through with it i neither spoke nor moved the officer walked off angrily and sent for a guard to have mother taken before general bowens once through her speech mother yielded to the entreaties of the ladies and professed herself ready to take the oath since she was obliged to madam i did not invite you to come said the polite officer who refused to administer the oath and putting several soldiers on board ordered them to keep all on board until one could report to general bowens mother retired to the cabin while we still kept our seats above oh that monotonous never ending canal we thought it would go on forever at last we came to the basin in the centre of the city here was a position for ladies sitting like irish emigrants on their earthly possessions and coming in a schooner to new orleans which a year ago would have filled us with horror again the landing was reached and again we were boarded by officers i don't know how they knew of the difficulty mother had made but they certainly did and ordered that none should leave until the general's will was made known mrs bull and mrs ivy after a long delay and many representations at last prepared to leave i was sitting in the spot i had occupied ever since before daylight with nothing to support me above my hips all of us had fasted since an early and light supper the night before none had slept i was growing so weak from these three causes and the burning sun for it was now twelve that i could hardly speak when they came to tell me good bye alarmed at my appearance mrs bull entreated the officer to allow me to leave the boat no he said it was impossible we should remain on board until general bowens could come we may get an answer in half an hour or we may not get it for some time and there we must stay until it came but this young lady has been ill for months she is perfectly exhausted and will faint if she is not removed immediately pleaded mrs bull she did not know my powers of control faint i would have expired silently first the officer said those were his orders i could not leave do you think you are performing your duty as a gentleman and a christian this young lady has obtained her pass already without the slightest difficulty she persisted still he said he was acting according to orders not to be baffled she begged that she might be allowed to take me to brother telling him who he was while our trunk miriam tiche and mother would remain as hostages then he gave a reluctant consent on condition i left my number so he could go after me when i was wanted i don't know what good came of the consent for there i was to remain until something i don't know what happened i only know i was growing deathly sick and faint and could hardly hold myself up when some time after mrs bull and mrs ivy left under the impression that i was to go immediately a gentleman in citizen's clothes came to me and said he had obtained permission for me to wait general bowen's orders in his office a few steps from the schooner thankful for so much i accepted his arm and slowly dragged myself along to the first shelter i had seen that day by some wonderful condescension miriam and mother were allowed to follow and with the guard at the door we waited there for half an hour more until our sentence could be received miriam had written a line to brother as soon as possible telling him of the situation and while we were waiting in this office i half dead with fatigue a carriage dashed up to the door and out of it stepped brother i felt that all our troubles were over then he looked so glad to see us that it seemed a pity to tell the disagreeable story that yet remained to be told but once heard he made all go right in a few moments he got into the carriage with mother to take her to general bowens while we got into another to come to the house i saw no more of the guard or officer when we arrived sister was too astonished to speak she did not believe we would come when it was ordered that all should take the oath on entering if we had only realized it i don't think we would either in half an hour mother got back supported by brother's presence she had managed to hold up her right hand and say yes to the oath which was more than any of us had done brother found and officer at the door who had been ordered before he took mother to the general to arrest her and confine her in the custom house i suppose miriam and i would have shared the imprisonment with her but brother has a way of making all these things right and the man was sent back without accomplishing his mission sunday april 26th i am getting well bless the lord o my soul life health and happiness dawn on my trembling view again dr stone came to see me a few hours after i arrived two days after he called again this morning i walked out to meet him when he was announced and he asked me how my sister was when i told him i was myself god bless my soul you don't say so he exclaimed evidently astonished at the resurrection thursday april 30th was not the recollection of this day bitter enough to me already i did not think it could be more so yet behold me crying as i have not cried for many and many a day not for harry i dare not cry for him i feel a deathlike quiet when i think of him a fear that even a deep drawn breath would wake him in his grave and as dearly as i love you o hal i don't want you in this dreary world again talk of the revocation of the edict of nantes talk of louis xiv of pshaw my head is in such a whirl that history gets all mixed up and all parallels seem weak and moderate in comparison to this infamous outrage to day thousands of families from the most respectable down to the least all who have had the firmness to register themselves enemies to the united states are ordered to leave the city before the fifteenth of may think of the thousands perfectly destitute who can hardly afford to buy their daily bread even here sent to the confederacy where it is neither to be earned nor bought without money friends or a home hundreds have comfortable homes here which will be confiscated to enrich those who drive them out it is an ill wind that blows no one good such dismal faces as one meets everywhere each looks heartbroken homeless friendless beggars is written in every eye brother's face is too unhappy to make it pleasant to look at him true he is safe but hundreds of his friends are going forth destitute leaving happy homes behind not knowing where the crust of bread for famishing children is to come from to morrow he went to general bowens and asked if it were possible that women and children were included in the order yes he said they should all go and go in the confederacy they should not be allowed to go elsewhere penned up like sheep to starve that's the idea with the addition of forty thousand mouths to feed they think they can invoke famine to their aid seeing that their negro brothers don't help them much in the task of subjugating us don't care who knows i smuggled in a dozen letters wish i had had more
no 211 camp st april 19th 1865 all things are taken from us and become portions and parcels of the dreadful pasts thursday the 13th came the dreadful tidings of the surrender of lee and his army on the 9th everybody cried but i would not satisfied that god will still save us even though all should apparently be lost followed at intervals of two or three hours by the announcement of the capture of richmond selma mobile and johnston's army even the stanchest southerners were hopeless every one proclaimed peace and the only matter under consideration was whether jeff davis all politicians every man above the rank of captain in the army and above that of lieutenant in the navy should be hanged immediately or some graciously pardoned henry ward beecher humanely pleaded mercy for us supported by a small minority davis and all leading men must be executed the blood of the others would serve to irrigate the country under this lively prospect peace blessed peace was the cry i whispered never let a great earthquake swallow us up first let us leave our land and emigrate to any desert spot of the earth rather than return to the union even as it was six days this has lasted blessed with the silently obstinate disposition i would not dispute but felt my heart swell repeating god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in time of trouble and could not for an instant believe this could end in an overthrow this morning when i went down to breakfast at seven brother read the announcement of the assassination of lincoln and secretary seward vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord this is murder god have mercy on those who did it charlotte corday killed marat in his bath and is held up in history as one of liberty's martyrs and one of the heroines of her country to me it is all murder let historians extol blood shedding it is woman's place to abhor it and because i know that they would have apotheosized any man who had crucified jeff davis i abhor this and call it foul murder unworthy of our cause and god grant it was only the temporary insanity of a desperate man that committed this crime let not his blood be visited on our nation lord across the way a large building undoubtedly inhabited by officers is being draped in black immense streamers of black and white hang from the balcony downtown i understand all shops are closed and all wrapped in mourning and i hardly dare pray god to bless us with the crape hanging over the way it would have been banners if our president had been killed though saturday 22d april to see a whole city draped in mourning is certainly an imposing spectacle and becomes almost grand when it is considered as an expression of universal affliction so it is in one sense for the more violently secesh the inmates the more thankful they are for lincoln's death the more profusely the houses are decked with the emblems of woe they all look to me like not sorry for him but dreadfully grieved to be forced to this demonstration so all things have indeed assumed a funereal aspect men who have hated lincoln with all their souls under terror of confiscation and imprisonment which they understand is the alternative tie black crape from every practicable knob and point to save their homes last evening the b s were all in tears preparing their mourning what sensibility what patriotism a stranger would have exclaimed but bella's first remark was is it not horrible this vile vile old crape think of hanging it out when tears of rage finished the sentence one would have thought pity for the murdered man had very little to do with it coming back in the cars i had a rencontre that makes me gnash my teeth yet it was after dark and i was the only lady in a car crowded with gentlemen i placed little miriam on my lap to make room for some of them when a great dark man all in black entered and took the seat and my left hand at the same instant saying good evening miss sarah frightened beyond measure to recognize captain todd 1 of the yankee army in my interlocutor i however preserved a quiet exterior and without the slightest demonstration answered as though replying to an internal question mr todd it is a long while since we met he ventured four years i returned mechanically you have been well my health has been bad i have been ill myself and determined to break the ice he diverged with baton rouge has changed sadly i hope i shall never see it again we have suffered too much to recall home with any pleasure i understand you have suffered severely he said glancing at my black dress we have yet one left in the army though i could not help saying he too had a brother there he said he pulled the check string as we reached the house adding this is it and absurdly correcting himself with where do you live 211 i thank you good evening the last with emphasis as he prepared to follow he returned the salutation and i hurriedly regained the house monsieur stood over the way a look through the blinds showed him returning to his domicile several doors below i returned to my own painful reflections the mr todd who was my sweetheart when i was twelve and he twenty four who was my brother's friend and daily at our home was put away from among our acquaintance at the beginning of the war this one i should not know cords of candy and mountains of bouquets bestowed in childish days will not make my country's enemy my friend now that i am a woman
vile old yankee boats four in number passed up this morning without stopping after all our excitement this silent contempt annihilated me what in the world do they mean the river was covered with burning cotton perhaps they want to see where it came from our lawful owners have at last arrived about sunset day before yesterday the iroquois anchored here and a graceful young federal stepped ashore carrying a yankee flag over his shoulder and asked the way to the mayor's office i like the style if we girls of baton rouge had been at the landing instead of the men that yankee would never have insulted us by flying his flag in our faces we would have opposed his landing except under a flag of truce but the men let him alone and he even found a poor dutchman willing to show him the road he did not accomplish much said a formal demand would be made next day and asked if it was safe for the men to come ashore and buy a few necessaries when he was assured the air of baton rouge was very unhealthy for yankee soldiers at night he promised very magnanimously not to shell us out if we did not molest him but i notice none of them dare set their feet on terra firma except the officer who has now called three times on the mayor and who is said to tremble visibly as he walks the streets last evening came the demand the town must be surrendered immediately the federal flag must be raised they would grant us the same terms they granted new orleans jolly terms those were the answer was worthy of a southerner it was the town was defenseless if we had cannon there were not men enough to resist but if forty vessels lay at the landing it was intimated we were in their power and more ships coming up we would not surrender if they wanted they might come and take us if they wished the federal flag hoisted over the arsenal they might put it up for themselves the town had no control over government property glorious what a pity they did not shell the town but they are taking us at our word and this morning they are landing at the garrison all devices signs and flags of the confederacy shall be suppressed so says picayune butler good i devote all my red white and blue silk to the manufacture of confederate flags as soon as one is confiscated i make another until my ribbon is exhausted when i will sport a duster emblazoned in high colors hurra for the bonny blue flag henceforth i wear one pinned to my bosom not a duster but a little flag the man who says take it off will have to pull it off for himself the man who dares attempt it well a pistol in my pocket fills up the gap i am capable too this is a dreadful war to make even the hearts of women so bitter i hardly know myself these last few weeks i who have such a horror of bloodshed consider even killing in self defense murder who cannot wish them the slightest evil whose only prayer is to have them sent back in peace to their own country i talk of killing them for what else do i wear a pistol and carving knife i am afraid i will try them on the first one who says an insolent word to me yes and repent for it ever after in sackcloth and ashes o if i was only a man then i could don the breeches and slay them with a will if some few southern women were in the ranks they could set the men an example they would not blush to follow pshaw there are no women here we are all men may 10th last night about one o'clock i was wakened and told that mother and miriam had come oh how glad i was i tumbled out of bed half asleep and hugged miriam in a dream but waked up when i got to mother they came up under a flag of truce on a boat going up for provisions which by the way was brought to by half a dozen yankee ships in succession with a threat to send a broadside into her if she did not stop the wretches knew it must be under a flag of truce no boats leave except by special order to procure provisions what tales they had to tell they were on the wharf and saw the ships sail up the river saw the broadside fired into will pinckney's regiment the boats we fired our gunboats floating down to meet them all wrapped in flames twenty thousand bales of cotton blazing in a single pile molasses and sugar thrown over everything they stood there opposite to where one of the ships landed expecting a broadside and resolute not to be shot in the back i wish i had been there and captain huger is not dead they had hopes of his life for the first time day before yesterday miriam saw the ball that had just been extracted he will probably be lame for the rest of his life it will be a glory to him for even the federal officers say that never did they see so gallant a little ship or one that fought so desperately as the mcrae men and officers fought like devils think of all those great leviathans after the poor little widow mickey one came tearing down on her sideways while the brooklyn fired on her from the other side when brave captain warley put the nose of the manassas under the first and tilted her over so that the whole broadside passed over instead of through the mcrae who spit back its poor little fire at both and after all was lost she carried the wounded and the prisoners to new orleans and was scuttled by her own men in port glorious captain huger and think of his sending word to jimmy suffering as he was that his little brass cannon was game to the last oh i hope he will recover brave dare devil captain warley is prisoner and on the way to fort warren that home of all brave patriotic men we'll have him out and my poor little jimmy if i have not spoken of him it is not because i have lost sight of him for a moment the day the mcrae went down he arose from his bed ill as he was and determined to rejoin her as his own boat the mississippi was not ready when he reached the st charles he fell so very ill that he had to be carried back to brother's only his desperate illness saved him from being among the killed or wounded on that gallant little ship a few days after he learned the fate of the ship and was told that captain huger was dead no wonder he should cry so bitterly for captain huger was as tender and as kind to him as his own dear father god bless him for it the enemy's ships were sailing up so he threw a few articles in a carpet bag and started off for richmond corinth anywhere to fight sick weak hardly able to stand he went off two weeks ago yesterday we know not where and we have never heard from him since whether he succumbed to that jaundice and the rest and lies dead or dying on the road god only knows we can only wait and pray god to send dear little jimmy home in safety and this is war heaven save me from like scenes and experiences again i was wild with excitement last night when miriam described how the soldiers marching to the depot waved their hats to the crowds of women and children shouting god bless you ladies we will fight for you and they waving their handkerchiefs sobbed with one voice god bless you soldiers fight for us we too have been having our fun early in the evening four more gunboats sailed up here we saw them from the corner three squares off crowded with men even up in the riggings the american flag was flying from every peak it was received in profound silence by the hundreds gathered on the banks i could hardly refrain from a groan much as i once loved that flag i hate it now i came back and made myself a confederate flag about five inches long slipped the staff in my belt pinned the flag to my shoulder and walked downtown to the consternation of women and children who expected something awful to follow an old negro cried my young missus got her flag flyin anyhow nettie made one and hid it in the folds of her dress but we were the only two who ventured we went to the state house terrace and took a good look at the brooklyn which was crowded with people who took a good look at us likewise the picket stationed at the garrison took alarm at half a dozen men on horseback and ran saying that the citizens were attacking the kind officers aboard the ship sent us word that if they were molested the town would be shelled let them butchers does it take thirty thousand men and millions of dollars to murder defenseless women and children o the great nation bravo may 11th i i am disgusted with myself no unusual thing but i am peculiarly disgusted this time last evening i went to mrs brunot's without an idea of going beyond with my flag flying again they were all going to the state house so i went with them to my great distress some fifteen or twenty federal officers were standing on the first terrace stared at like wild beasts by the curious crowd i had not expected to meet them and felt a painful conviction that i was unnecessarily attracting attention by an unladylike display of defiance from the crowd gathered there but what was i to do i felt humiliated conspicuous everything that is painful and disagreeable but strike my colors in the face of the enemy never nettie and sophie had them too but that was no consolation for the shame i suffered by such a display so totally distasteful to me how i wished myself away and chafed at my folly and hated myself for being there and every one for seeing me i hope it will be a lesson to me always to remember a lady can gain nothing by such display i was not ashamed of the flag of my country i proved that by never attempting to remove it in spite of my mortification but i was ashamed of my position for these are evidently gentlemen not the billy wilson's crew we were threatened with fine noble looking men they were showing refinement and gentlemanly bearing in every motion one cannot help but admire such foes they set us an example worthy of our imitation and one we would be benefited by following they come as visitors without either pretensions to superiority or the insolence of conquerors they walk quietly their way offering no annoyance to the citizens though they themselves are stared at most unmercifully and pursued by crowds of ragged little boys while even men gape at them with open mouths they prove themselves gentlemen while many of our citizens have proved themselves boors and i admire them for their conduct with a conviction that i had allowed myself to be influenced by bigoted narrow minded people in believing them to be unworthy of respect or regard i came home wonderfully changed in all my newly acquired sentiments resolved never more to wound their feelings who were so careful of ours by such unnecessary display and i hung my flag on the parlor mantel there to wave if it will in the shades of private life but to make a show make me conspicuous and ill at ease as i was yesterday never again there was a dozen officers in church this morning and the psalms for the 11th day seemed so singularly appropriate to the feelings of the people that i felt uncomfortable for them they answered with us though may 14th i am beginning to believe that we are even of more importance in baton rouge than we thought we were it is laughable to hear the things a certain set of people who know they can't visit us say about the whole family when father was alive they dared not talk about us aloud beyond calling us the proud morgans and the aristocracy of baton rouge but now father is gone the people imagine we are public property to be criticized vilified and abused to their hearts content and now because they find absurdities don't succeed they try improbabilities so yesterday the town was in a ferment because it was reported the federal officers had called on the miss morgans and all the gentlemen were anxious to hear how they had been received one had the grace to say if they did they received the best lesson there that they could get in town those young ladies would meet them with the true southern spirit the rest did not know they would like to find out i suppose the story originated from the fact that we were unwilling to blackguard yes that is the word the federal officers here and would not agree with many of our friends in saying they were liars thieves murderers scoundrels the scum of the earth etc such epithets are unworthy of ladies i say and do harm rather than advance our cause let them be what they will it shall not make me less the lady i say it is unworthy of anything except low newspaper war such abuse and i will not join in i have a brother in law in the federal army whom i love and respect as much as any one in the world and shall not readily agree that his being a northerner would give him an irresistible desire to pick my pockets and take from him all power of telling the truth no there are few men i admire more than major drum and i honor him for his independence in doing what he believes right let us have liberty of speech and action in our land i say but not gross abuse and calumny shall i acknowledge that the people we so recently called our brothers are unworthy of consideration and are liars cowards dogs not i if they conquer us i acknowledge them as a superior race i will not say that we were conquered by cowards for where would that place us it will take a brave people to gain us and that the northerners undoubtedly are i would scorn to have an inferior foe i fight only my equals these women may acknowledge that cowards have won battles in which their brothers were engaged but i i will ever say mine fought against brave men and won the day which is most honorable i was never a secessionist for i quietly adopted father's views on political subjects without meddling with them but even father went over with his state and when so many outrages were committed by the fanatical leaders of the north though he regretted the union said fight to the death for our liberty i say so too i want to fight until we win the cause so many have died for i don't believe in secession but i do in liberty i want the south to conquer dictate its own terms and go back to the union for i believe that apart inevitable ruin awaits both it is a rope of sand this confederacy founded on the doctrine of secession and will not last many years not five the north cannot subdue us we are too determined to be free they have no right to confiscate our property to pay debts they themselves have incurred death as a nation rather than union on such terms we will have our rights secured on so firm a basis that it can never be shaken if by power of overwhelming numbers they conquer us it will be a barren victory over a desolate land we the natives of this loved soil will be beggars in a foreign land we will not submit to despotism under the garb of liberty the north will find herself burdened with an unparalleled debt with nothing to show for it except deserted towns burning homes a standing army which will govern with no small caprice and an impoverished land if that be treason make the best of it may 17th one of these days when peace is restored and we are quietly settled in our allotted corners of this wide world without any particularly exciting event to alarm us and with the knowledge of what is now the future and will then be the dead past seeing that all has been for the best for us in the end that all has come right in spite of us we will wonder how we could ever have been foolish enough to await each hour in such breathless anxiety we will ask ourselves if it was really true that nightly as we lay down to sleep we did not dare plan for the morning feeling that we might be homeless and beggars before the dawn how unreal it will then seem we will say it was our wild imagination perhaps but how bitterly horribly true it is now four days ago the yankees left us to attack vicksburg leaving their flag flying in the garrison without a man to guard it and with the understanding that the town would be held responsible for it it was intended for a trap and it succeeded for night before last it was pulled down and torn to pieces now unless will will have the kindness to sink a dozen of their ships up there i hear he has command of the lower batteries they will be back in a few days and will execute their threat of shelling the town if they do what will become of us all we expect in the way of earthly property is as yet mere paper which will be so much trash if the south is ruined as it consists of debts due father by many planters for professional services rendered who of course will be ruined too so all money is gone that is nothing we will not be ashamed to earn our bread so let it go but this house is at least a shelter from the weather all sentiment apart and our servants too how could they manage without us the yankees on the river and a band of guerrillas in the woods are equally anxious to precipitate a fight between the two fires what chance for us it would take only a little while to burn the city over our heads they say the women and children must be removed these guerrillas where please charlie says we must go to greenwell and have this house pillaged for butler has decreed that no unoccupied house shall be respected if we stay through the battle if the federals are victorious we will suffer for the officers here were reported to have said if the people here did not treat them decently they would know what it was when billy wilson's crew arrived they would give them a lesson that select crowd is now in new orleans heaven help us when they reach here it is in these small cities that the greatest outrages are perpetrated what are we to do a new proclamation from butler has just come it seems that the ladies have an ugly way of gathering their skirts when the federals pass to avoid any possible contact some even turn up their noses unladylike to say the least but it is maybe owing to the odor they have which is said to be unbearable even at this early season of the year butler says whereas the so called ladies of new orleans insult his men and officers he gives one and all permission to insult any or all who so treat them then and there with the assurance that the women will not receive the slightest protection from the government and that the men will all be justified i did not have time to read it but repeat it as it was told to me by mother who is in utter despair at the brutality of the thing these men our brothers not mine let us hope for the honor of their nation that butler is not counted among the gentlemen of the land and so if any man should fancy he cared to kiss me he could do so under the pretext that i had pulled my dress from under his feet that will justify them and if we decline their visits they can insult us under the plea of a prior affront oh gibbes george jimmy never did we need your protection as sorely as now and not to know even whether you are alive when charlie joins the army we will be defenseless indeed come to my bosom o my discarded carving knife laid aside under the impression that these men were gentlemen we will be close friends once more and if you must have a sheath perhaps i may find one for you in the heart of the first man who attempts to butlerize me i never dreamed of kissing any man save my father and brothers and why any one should care to kiss any one else i fail to understand and i do not propose to learn to make exceptions still no word from the boys we hear that norfolk has been evacuated but no details george was there gibbes is wherever johnston is presumably on the rappahannock but it is more than six weeks since we have heard from either of them and all communication is cut off may 21st i have had such a search for shoes this week that i am disgusted with shopping i am triumphant now for after traversing the town in every direction and finding nothing i finally discovered a pair of boots just made for a little negro to go fishing with and only an inch and a half too long for me besides being unbendable but i seized them with avidity and the little negro would have been outbid if i had not soon after discovered a pair more seemly if not more serviceable which i took without further difficulty behold my tender feet cased in crocodile skin patent leather tipped low quarter boy's shoes no 2 what a fall was there my country from my pretty english glove kid to sabots made of some animal closely connected with the hippopotamus a dernier ressort vraiment for my choice was that or cooling my feet on the burning pavement au naturel i who have such a terror of any one seeing my naked foot and this is thanks to war and blockade not a decent shoe in the whole community n'importe better days are coming we'll all have shoes after a while perhaps why did not mark tapley leave me a song calculated to keep the spirits up under depressing circumstances i need one very much and have nothing more suggestive than the old methodist hymn better days are coming we'll all go right which i shout so constantly as our prospects darken that it begins to sound stale may 27th the cry is ho for greenwell very probably this day week will see us there i don't want to go if we were at peace and were to spend a few months of the warmest season out there none would be more eager and delighted than i but to leave our comfortable home and all it contains for a rough pine cottage seventeen miles away even from this scanty civilization is sad it must be we are hourly expecting two regiments of yankees to occupy the garrison and some fifteen hundred of our men are awaiting them a little way off so the fight seems inevitable and we must go leaving what little has already been spared us to the tender mercies of northern volunteers who from the specimen of plundering they gave us two weeks ago will hardly leave us even the shelter of our roof o my dear home how can i help but cry at leaving you forever for if this fight occurs never again shall i pass the threshold of this house where we have been so happy and sad the scene of joyous meetings and mournful partings the place where we greeted each other with glad shouts after even so short a parting the place where harry and father kissed us good bye and never came back again i know what lavinia has suffered this long year by what we have suffered these last six weeks poor lavinia so far away how easier poverty if it must come would be if we could bear it together i wonder if the real fate of the boys if we ever hear can be so dreadful as this suspense still no news of them my poor little jimmy and think how desperate gibbes and george will be when they read butler's proclamation and they not able to defend us gibbes was in our late victory of fredericksburg i know in other days going to greenwell was the signal for general noise and confusion all the boys gathered their guns and fishing tackle and thousand and one amusements father sent out provisions we helped mother pack hal and i tumbled over the libraries to lay in a supply of reading material and all was bustle until the carriage drove to the door at daylight one morning and swept us off it is not so gay this time i wandered around this morning selecting books alone we can only take what is necessary the rest being left to the care of the northern militia in general i never knew before how many articles were perfectly indispensable to me this or that little token or keepsake piles of letters i hate to burn many dresses etc i cannot take conveniently lie around me and i hardly know which to choose among them yet half must be sacrificed i can only take one trunk may 30th greenwell after all our trials and tribulations here we are at last and no limbs lost how many weeks ago was it since i wrote here it seems very long after all these events let me try to recall them wednesday the 28th a day to be forever remembered as luck would have it we rose very early and had breakfast sooner than usual it would seem for the express design of becoming famished before dinner i picked up some of my letters and papers and set them where i could find them whenever we were ready to go to greenwell burning a pile of trash and leaving a quantity equally worthless which were of no value even to myself except from association i was packing up my traveling desk with all harry's little articles that were left to me and other things and i was saying to myself that my affairs were in such confusion that if obliged to run unexpectedly i would not know what to save when i heard lilly's voice downstairs crying as she ran in she had been out shopping mr castle has killed a federal officer on a ship and they are going to shell bang went a cannon at the word and that was all our warning mother had just come in and was lying down but sprang to her feet and added her screams to the general confusion miriam who had been searching the libraries ran up to quiet her lilly gathered her children crying hysterically all the time and ran to the front door with them as they were lucy saved the baby naked as she took her from her bath only throwing a quilt over her i bethought me of my running bag which i had used on a former case and in a moment my few precious articles were secured under my hoops and with a sunbonnet on i stood ready for anything the firing still continued they must have fired half a dozen times before we could coax mother off what awful screams i had hoped never to hear them again after harry died charlie had gone to greenwell before daybreak to prepare the house so we four women with all those children and servants were left to save ourselves i did not forget my poor little jimmy i caught up his cage and ran down just at this moment mother recovered enough to insist on saving father's papers which was impossible as she had not an idea of where the important ones were i heard miriam plead argue insist command her to run lilly shriek and cry she should go the children screaming within women running by without crying and moaning but i could not join in i was going i knew not where it was impossible to take my bird for even if i could carry him he would starve so i took him out of his cage kissed his little yellow head and tossed him up he gave one feeble little chirp as if to ascertain where to go and then for the first and last time i cried laying my head against the gate post and with my eyes too dim to see him oh how it hurt me to lose my little bird one jimmy had given me too but the next minute we were all off in safety a square from home i discovered that boy shoes were not the most comfortable things to run in so i ran back in spite of cannonading entreaties etc to get another pair i got home found an old pair that were by no means respectable which i seized without hesitation and being perfectly at ease thought it would be so nice to save at least miriam's and my tooth brushes so slipped them in my corsets these in of course we must have a comb that was added then how could we stand the sun without starch to cool our faces this included the powder bag then i must save that beautiful lace collar and my hair was tumbling down so in went the tuckingcomb and hair pins with the rest until if there had been any one to speculate they would have wondered a long while at the singular appearance of a girl who is considered as very slight usually by this time miriam alarmed for me returned to find me though urged by dr castleton not to risk her life by attempting it and we started off together we had hardly gone a square when we decided to return a second time and get at least a few articles for the children and ourselves who had nothing except what we happened to have on when the shelling commenced she picked up any little things and threw them to me while i filled a pillow case jerked from the bed and placed my powder and brushes in it with the rest before we could leave mother alarmed for us both came to find us with tiche 1 all this time they had been shelling but there was quite a lull when she got there and she commenced picking up father's papers vowing all the time she would not leave every argument we could use was of no avail and we were desperate as to what course to pursue when the shelling recommenced in a few minutes then mother recommenced her screaming and was ready to fly anywhere and holding her box of papers with a faint idea of saving something she picked up two dirty underskirts and an old cloak by dint of miriam's vehement appeals aided by a great deal of pulling we got her down to the back door we had given our pillow case to tiche who added another bundle and all our silver to it and had already departed as we stood in the door four or five shells sailed over our heads at the same time seeming to make a perfect corkscrew of the air for it sounded as though it went in circles miriam cried never mind the door mother screamed anew and i stayed behind to lock the door with this new music in my ears we reached the back gate that was on the street when another shell passed us and miriam jumped behind the fence for protection we had only gone half a square when dr castleton begged us to take another street as they were firing up that one we took his advice but found our new street worse than the old for the shells seemed to whistle their strange songs with redoubled vigor the height of my ambition was now attained i had heard jimmy laugh about the singular sensation produced by the rifled balls spinning around one's head and here i heard the same peculiar sound ran the same risk and was equal to the rest of the boys for was i not in the midst of flying shells in the middle of a bombardment i think i was rather proud of it we were alone on the road all had run away before so i thought it was for our especial entertainment this little affair i cannot remember how long it lasted i am positive that the clock struck ten before i left home but i had been up so long i know not what time it began though i am told it was between eight and nine we passed the graveyard we did not even stop and about a mile and a half from home when mother was perfectly exhausted with fatigue and unable to proceed farther we met a gentleman in a buggy who kindly took charge of her and our bundles we could have walked miles beyond then for as soon as she was safe we felt as though a load had been removed from our shoulders and after exhorting her not to be uneasy about us and reminding her we had a pistol and a dagger i had secured a for true one the day before fortunately she drove off and we trudged on alone the only people in sight on foot though occasionally carriages and buggies would pass going towards town one party of gentlemen put their heads out and one said there are judge morgan's daughters sitting by the road but i observed he did not offer them the slightest assistance however others were very kind one i never heard of had volunteered to go for us and bring us to mother when she was uneasy about our staying so long when we went home to get clothes we heard him ring and knock but thinking it must be next door paid no attention so he went back and mother came herself we were two miles away when we sat down by the road to rest and have a laugh here were two women married and able to take care of themselves flying for their lives and leaving two lorn girls alone on the road to protect each other to be sure neither could help us and one was not able to walk and the other had helpless children to save but it was so funny when we talked about it and thought how sorry both would be when they regained their reason while we were yet resting we saw a cart coming and giving up all idea of our walking to greenwell called the people to stop to our great delight it proved to be a cart loaded with mrs brunot's affairs driven by two of her negroes who kindly took us up with them on the top of their luggage and we drove off in state as much pleased at riding in that novel place as though we were accustomed to ride in wheelbarrows miriam was in a hollow between a flour barrel and a mattress and i at the end astride i am afraid of a tremendous bundle for my face was down the road and each foot resting very near the sides of the cart i tried to make a better arrangement though after a while these servants were good enough to lend us their umbrella without which i am afraid we would have suffered severely for the day was intensely warm three miles from town we began to overtake the fugitives hundreds of women and children were walking along some bareheaded and in all costumes little girls of twelve and fourteen were wandering on alone i called to one i knew and asked where her mother was she did n't know she would walk on until she found out it seems her mother lost a nursing baby too which was not found until ten that night white and black were all mixed together and were as confidential as though related all called to us and asked where we were going and many we knew laughed at us for riding on a cart but as they had walked only five miles i imagined they would like even these poor accommodations if they were in their reach the negroes deserve the greatest praise for their conduct hundreds were walking with babies or bundles ask them what they had saved it was invariably my mistress's clothes or silver or baby ask what they had for themselves it was bless your heart honey i was glad to get away with mistress's things i did n't think bout mine it was a heart rending scene women searching for their babies along the road where they had been lost others sitting in the dust crying and wringing their hands for by this time we had not an idea but what baton rouge was either in ashes or being plundered and we had saved nothing i had one dress miriam two but tiche had them and we had lost her before we left home presently we came on a guerrilla camp men and horses were resting on each side of the road some sick some moving about carrying water to the women and children and all looking like a monster barbecue for as far as the eye could see through the woods was the same repetition of men and horses they would ask for the news and one drunk with excitement or whiskey informed us that it was our own fault if we had saved nothing the people must have been fools not to have known trouble would come before long and that it was the fault of the men who were aware of it that the women were thus forced to fly in vain we pleaded that there was no warning no means of foreseeing this he cried you are ruined so am i and my brothers too and by there is nothing left but to die now and i'll die good i said but die fighting for us he waved his hand black with powder and shouted that i will after us that was the only swearing guerrilla we met the others seemed to have too much respect for us to talk loud lucy had met us before this early in the action lilly had sent her back to get some baby clothes but a shell exploding within a few feet of her she took alarm and ran up another road for three miles when she cut across the plantations and regained the greenwell route it is fortunate that without consultation the thought of running here should have seized us all may 31st i was interrupted so frequently yesterday that i know not how i continued to write so much first i was sent for to go to mrs brunot who had just heard of her son's death and who was alone with dena and some hours after i was sent for to see fanny now mrs trezevant who had just come with her husband to bring us news of george a mrs montgomery who saw him every day at norfolk said jimmy was with him and though very sick at first was now in good health the first news in all that long time when the city was evacuated george went with his regiment seven miles from richmond jimmy to the city itself as aide to com hollins this lady brought george's opal ring and diamond pin howell and mr badger who had just joined the guerrillas as independents spent the day with me we were all in such confusion that i felt ashamed every one as dirty as possible i had on the same dress i had escaped in which though then perfectly clean was now rather dirty but they knew what a time we had had to return to my journal lucy met mother some long way ahead of us whose conscience was already reproaching her for leaving us and in answer to her what has become of my poor girls ran down the road to find us for lucy thinks the world can't keep on moving without us when she met us she walked by the cart and it was with difficulty we persuaded her to ride a mile she said she felt used to walking now about five miles from home we overtook mother the gentleman had been obliged to go for his wife so mary gave her her seat on the cart and walked with lucy three miles beyond where we heard that lilly and the children had arrived in a cart early in the day all the talk by the roadside was of burning homes houses knocked to pieces by balls famine murder desolation so i comforted myself singing better days are coming and i hope to die shouting the lord will provide while lucy toiled through the sun and dust and answered with a chorus of i'm a runnin a runnin up to glo ry it was three o'clock when we reached mr david's and found lilly how warm and tired we were a hasty meal which tasted like a feast after our fatigue gave us fresh strength and lilly and miriam got in an old cart with the children to drive out here leaving me with mother and dellie to follow next day about sunset charlie came flying down the road on his way to town i decided to go and after an obstinate debate with mother in which i am afraid i showed more determination than amiability i wrung a reluctant consent from her and promising not to enter if it was being fired or plundered drove off in triumph it was a desperate enterprise for a young girl to enter a town full of soldiers on such an expedition at night but i knew charlie could take care of me and if he was killed i could take care of myself so i went it was long after nine when we got there and my first act was to look around the deserted house what a scene of confusion armoirs spread open with clothes tumbled in every direction inside and out ribbons laces on floors chairs overturned my desk wide open covered with letters trinkets etc bureau drawers half out the bed filled with odds and ends of everything i no longer recognized my little room on the bolster was a little box at the sight of which i burst out laughing five minutes before the alarm miriam had been selecting those articles she meant to take to greenwell and holding up her box said if we were forced to run for our lives without a moment's warning i d risk my life to save this rather than leave it yet here lay the box and she was safe at greenwell it took me two hours to pack father's papers then i packed miriam's trunk then some of mother's and mine listening all the while for a cannon for men were constantly tramping past the house and only on condition our guerrillas did not disturb them had they promised not to recommence the shelling charlie went out to hear the news and i packed alone it seems the only thing that saved the town was two gentlemen who rowed out to the ships and informed the illustrious commander that there were no men there to be hurt and he was only killing women and children the answer was he was sorry he had hurt them he thought of course the town had been evacuated before the men were fools enough to fire on them and had only shelled the principal streets to intimidate the people these streets were the very ones crowded with flying women and children which they must have seen with their own eyes for those lying parallel to the river led to the garrison at one end and the crevasse at the other which cut off all the lower roads so that the streets he shelled were the only ones that the women could follow unless they wished to be drowned as for the firing four guerrillas were rash enough to fire on a yawl which was about to land without a flag of truce killing one wounding three one of whom afterwards died they were the only ones in town there was not a cannon in our hands even if a dozen men could be collected and this cannonading was kept up in return for half a dozen shots from as many rifles without even a show of resistance after so ended the momentous shelling of baton rouge during which the valiant farragut killed one whole woman wounded three struck some twenty houses several times apiece and indirectly caused the death of two little children who were drowned in their flight one poor little baby that was born in the woods and several cases of the same kind besides those who will yet die from the fatigue as mrs w d phillips who had not left her room since january who was carried out in her nightgown and is now supposed to be in a dying condition the man who took mother told us he had taken a dying woman in the act of expiring in his buggy from her bed and had left her a little way off where she had probably breathed her last a few moments after there were many similar cases hurrah for the illustrious farragut the woman killer it was three o'clock before i left off packing and took refuge in a tub of cold water from the dust and heat of the morning what a luxury the water was and when i changed my underclothes i felt like a new being to be sure i pulled off the skin of my heel entirely where it had been blistered by the walk dust sun etc but that was a trifle though still quite sore now for three hours i dreamed of rifled shells and battles and at half past six i was up and at work again mother came soon after and after hard work we got safely off at three saving nothing but our clothes and silver all else is gone it cost me a pang to leave my guitar and miriam's piano but it seems there was no help for it so i had to submit it was dark night when we reached here a bright fire was blazing in front but the house looked so desolate that i wanted to cry miriam cried when i told her her piano was left behind supper was a new sensation after having been without anything except a glass of clabber no saucers and a piece of bread since half past six i laid down on the hard floor to rest my weary bones thankful that i was so fortunate as to be able to lie down at all in my dozing state i heard the wagon come and miriam ordering a mattress to be put in the room for me i could make out very well you may take that one to miss eliza 1 but the next one shall be brought to miss sarah poor miriam she is always fighting my battles she and the servants are always taking my part against the rest of the world she and lucy made a bed and rolled me in it with no more questions and left me with damp eyes at the thought of how good and tender every one is to me poor lucy picked me a dish of blackberries to await my arrival and i was just as grateful for it though they were eaten by some one else before i came early yesterday morning miriam nettie and sophie who did not then know of their brother's death went to town in a cart determined to save some things miriam to save her piano as soon as they were halfway news reached us that any one was allowed to enter but none allowed to leave the town and all vehicles confiscated as soon as they reached there alarmed for their safety mother started off to find them and we have heard of none of them since what will happen next i am not uneasy they dare not harm them it is glorious to shell a town full of women but to kill four lone ones is not exciting enough
tuesday may 2d 1865 while praying for the return of those who have fought so nobly for us how i have dreaded their first days at home since the boys died i have constantly thought of what pain it would bring to see their comrades return without them to see families reunited and know that ours never could be again save in heaven last saturday the 29th of april seven hundred and fifty paroled louisianians from lee's army were brought here the sole survivors of ten regiments who left four years ago so full of hope and determination on the 29th of april 1861 george left new orleans with his regiment on the fourth anniversary of that day they came back but george and gibbes have long been lying in their graves
june 1st sunday from the news brought by one or two persons who managed to reach here yesterday i am more uneasy about mother and the girls a gentleman tells me that no one is permitted to leave without a pass and of these only such as are separated from their families who may have left before all families are prohibited to leave and furniture and other valuables also here is an agreeable arrangement i saw the pass just such as we give our negroes signed by a wisconsin colonel think of being obliged to ask permission from some low plowman to go in or out of our own house cannon are planted as far out as colonel davidson's six of them at our graveyard and one or more on all the other roads if the guerrillas do not attempt their capture i shall take it upon myself to suggest it to the very next one i see even if they cannot use them it will frighten the yankees who are in a state of constant alarm about them their reason for keeping people in town is that they hope they will not be attacked so long as our own friends remain thereby placing us above themselves in the scale of humanity since they acknowledge we are not brute enough to kill women and children as they did not hesitate to do farragut pleads that he could not restrain his men they were so enraged when the order was once given to fire and says they would strike a few houses though he ordered them to fire solely at horses and the clouds of dust in the street where guerrillas were supposed to be the dust was by no means thick enough to conceal that these guerrillas were women carrying babies instead of guns and the horses were drawing buggies in which many a sick woman was lying a young lady who applied to the yankee general for a pass to come out here having doubtless spoken of the number of women here who had fled and the position of the place was advised to remain in town and write to the ladies to return immediately and assure them that they would be respected and protected etc but that it was madness to remain at greenwell for a terrific battle would be fought there in a few days and they would be exposed to the greatest danger the girl wrote the letter but mr fox we are not quite such fools as to return there to afford you the protection our petticoats would secure to you thereby preventing you from receiving condign punishment for the injuries and loss of property already inflicted upon us by you no we remain here and if you are not laid low before you pass the comite bridge we can take to the woods again and camp out as many a poor woman is doing now a few miles from town many citizens have been arrested and after being confined a while and closely questioned have been released if the information is satisfactory a negro man is informing on all cotton burners and violent secessionists etc sunday night the girls have just got back riding in a mule team on top of baggage but without either mother or any of our affairs our condition is perfectly desperate miriam had an interview with general williams which was by no means satisfactory he gave her a pass to leave and bring us back for he says there is no safety here for us he will restrain his men in town and protect the women but once outside he will answer neither for his men nor the women and children as soon as he gets horses enough he passes this road going to camp moore with his cavalry and then we are in greater danger than ever any house shut up shall be occupied by soldiers five thousand are there now five more expected what shall we do mother remained sending miriam for me determined to keep us there rather than sacrifice both our lives and property by remaining here but then two weeks from now the yellow fever will break out mother has the greatest horror of it and we have never had it dying is not much in the present state of our affairs but the survivor will suffer even more than we do now if we stay how shall we live i have seventeen hundred dollars in confederate notes now in my running bag and three or four in silver the former will not be received there the latter might last two days if we save our house and furniture it is at the price of starving i am of opinion that we should send for mother and with what money we have make our way somewhere in the interior to some city where we can communicate with the boys and be advised by them this is not living home is lost beyond all hope of recovery if we wait what we have already saved will go too so we had better leave at once with what clothing we have which will certainly establish us on the footing of ladies if we chance to fall among vulgar people who never look beyond i fear the guerrillas will attack the town to night if they do god help mother general williams offered miriam an escort when he found she was without a protector in the most fatherly way he must be a good man she thanked him but said she felt perfectly safe on that road he bit his lip understanding the allusion and did not insist she was to deliver a message from parties in town to the first guerrillas they met concerning the safest roads and presently six met them and entered into conversation she told them of the proffered escort when one sprang forward crying why did n't you accept miss the next time ask for one and if it is at all disagreeable to you i am the very man to rid you of such an inconvenience i'll see that you are not annoyed long i am glad it was not sent she would have reproached herself with murder forever after i wonder if the general would have risked it baton rouge june 3d well day before yesterday i almost vowed i would not return and last evening i reached here verily consistency thou art a jewel i determined to get to town to lay both sides of the question before mother saving home and property by remaining thereby cutting ourselves off forever from the boys and dying of yellow fever or flying to mississippi losing all save our lives so as mrs brunot was panic stricken and determined to die in town rather than be starved at greenwell and was going in on the same wagon that came out the night before i got up with her and nettie and left greenwell at ten yesterday morning bringing nothing except this old book which i would rather not lose as it has been an old and kind friend during these days of trouble at first i avoided all mention of political affairs but now there is nothing else to be thought of if it is not burnt for treason i will like to look it over some day if i live i left greenwell without ever looking around it beyond one walk to the hotel so i may say i hardly know what it looks like miriam stayed much against her will i fear to bring in our trunks if i could send a wagon a guerrilla picket stopped us before we had gone a mile and seemed disposed to turn us back we said we must pass our all was at stake they then entreated us not to enter saying it was not safe i asked if they meant to burn it we will help try it was the answer i begged them to delay the experiment until we could get away one waved his hat to me and said he would fight for me hope he will at a distance they asked if we had no protectors none we said don't go then and they all looked so sorry for us we said we must starvation and another panic awaited us out there our brothers were fighting our fathers dead we had only our own judgment to rely on and that told us home was the best place for us if the town must burn let us burn in our houses rather than be murdered in the woods they looked still more sorry but still begged us not to remain we would though and one young boy called out as we drove off what's the name of that young lady who refused the escort i told him and they too expressed the greatest regret that she had not accepted we met many on the road nearly all of whom talked to us and as they were most respectful in their manner though they saw us in a mule team we gave them all the information we could which was all news to them though very little such a ride in the hot sun perched up in the air one of the servants remarked miss sarah ain't ashamed to ride in a wagon with truth i replied no i was never so high before two miles from home we met the first federal pickets and then they grew more numerous until we came on a large camp near our graveyard filled with soldiers and cannon from first to last none refrained from laughing at us not aloud but they would grin and be inwardly convulsed with laughter as we passed one laughed so comically that i dropped my veil hastily for fear he would see me smile i could not help it if any one smiled at me while i was dying i believe i would return it we passed crowds for it was now five o'clock and all seemed to be promenading there were several officers standing at the corner near our house who were very much amused at our vehicle i did not feel like smiling then after reducing us to riding in a mule team they were heartless enough to laugh i forgot them presently and gave my whole attention to getting out respectably now getting in a wagon is bad enough but getting out i hardly know how i managed it i had fully three feet to step down before reaching the wheel once there the driver picked me up and set me on the pavement the net i had gathered my hair in fell in my descent and my hair swept down halfway between my knee and ankle in one stream as i turned to get my little bundle the officers had moved their position to one directly opposite to me where they could examine me at leisure queens used to ride drawn by oxen hundreds of years ago so i played this was old times the mules were oxen i a queen and stalked off in a style i am satisfied would have imposed on juno herself when i saw them as i turned they were perfectly quiet but nettie says up to that moment they had been in convulsions of laughter with their handkerchiefs to their faces it was not polite i found mother safe but the house was in the most horrible confusion jimmy's empty cage stood by the door it had the same effect on me that empty coffins produce on others oh my birdie at six i could no longer stand my hunger i had fasted for twelve hours with the exception of a mouthful of hoecake at eleven i that never fasted in my life except last ash wednesday when lydia and i tried it for breakfast and got so sick we were glad to atone for it at dinner so i got a little piece of bread and corn beef from mrs daigre's servant for there was not a morsel here and i did not know where or what to buy presently some kind friend sent me a great short cake a dish of strawberry preserves and some butter which i was grateful for for the fact that the old negro was giving me part of her supper made me rather sparing though she cried eat it all honey i get plenty more mother went to cousin will's and i went to mrs brunot's to sleep and so ended my first day's ride on a mule team bah a lady can make anything respectable by the way she does it what do i care if i had been driving mules better that than walk seventeen miles i met dr duchêne and dr castleton twice each this morning they were as kind to me as they were to the girls the other day the latter saved them a disagreeable visit while here he and those three were packing some things in the hall when two officers passed and prepared to come in seeing three good looking girls seemingly alone for miriam's dress hid dr castleton as he leaned over the box just then she moved the doctor raised his head and the officers started back with an ah of surprise the doctor called them as they turned away and asked for a pass for the young ladies they came back bowing and smiling said they would write one in the house but they were told very dryly that there were no writing accommodations there they tried the fascinating and were much mortified by the coldness they met dear me why was n't i born old and ugly suppose i should unconsciously entrap some magnificent yankee what an awful thing it would be sentinels are stationed at every corner dr castleton piloted me safely through one expedition but on the next we had to part company and i passed through a crowd of at least fifty alone they were playing cards in the ditch and swearing dreadfully these pious yankees many were marching up and down some sleeping on the pavement others picking odious bugs out of each other's heads i thought of the guerrillas yellow fever and all and wished they were all safe at home with their mothers and sisters and we at peace again what a day i have had here mother and i are alone not a servant on the lot we will sleep here to night and i know she will be too nervous to let me sleep the dirt and confusion were extraordinary in the house i could not stand it so i applied myself to making it better i actually swept two whole rooms i ruined my hands at gardening so it made no difference i replaced piles of books crockery china that miriam had left packed for greenwell i discovered i could empty a dirty hearth dust move heavy weights make myself generally useful and dirty and all this is thanks to the yankees poor me this time last year i thought i would never walk again if i am not laid up forever after the fatigue of this last week i shall always maintain i have a constitution but it all seems nothing in this confusion everything is almost as bad as ever besides that i have been flying around to get miriam a wagon i know she is half distracted at being there alone mother chose staying with all its evils charlie's life would pay the penalty of a cotton burner if he returned so lilly remains at greenwell with him we three will get on as best we can here i wrote to the country to get a wagon sent a pass from headquarters but i will never know if it reached her until i see her in town i hope it will i would be better satisfied with miriam june 4th miriam and mattie drove in in the little buggy last evening after sunset to find out what we were to do our condition is desperate beauregard is about attacking these federals they say he is coming from corinth and the fight will be in town if true we are lost again starvation at greenwell fever and bullets here will put an end to us soon enough there is no refuge for us no one to consult brother whose judgment we rely on as implicitly as we did on father's we hear has gone to new york there is no one to advise or direct us for if he is gone there is no man in louisiana whose decision i would blindly abide by let us stay and die we can only die once we can suffer a thousand deaths with suspense and uncertainty the shortest is the best do you think the few words here can give an idea of our agony and despair nothing can express it i feel a thousand years old to day i have shed the bitterest tears to day that i have shed since father died i can't stand it much longer i'll give way presently and i know my heart will break shame where is god a fig for your religion if it only lasts while the sun shines better days are coming i can't troops are constantly passing and repassing they have scoured the country for ten miles out in search of guerrillas we are here without servants clothing or the bare necessaries of life suppose they should seize them on the way i procured a pass for the wagon but it now seems doubtful if i can get the latter a very faint chance well let them go our home next then we can die sure enough with god's help i can stand anything yet in store for me i hope to die shouting the lord will provide poor lavinia if she could only see us i am glad she does not know our condition 5 p.m what a day of agony doubt uncertainty and despair heaven save me from another such every hour fresh difficulties arose until i believe we were almost crazy every one of us as miriam was about stepping in the buggy to go to greenwell to bring in our trunks mother's heart misgave her and she decided to sacrifice her properly rather than remain in this state any longer after a desperate discussion which proved that each argument was death she decided to go back to greenwell and give up the keys of the house to general williams and let him do as he pleased rather than have it broken open during her absence mattie and mr tunnard were present at the discussion which ended by the latter stepping in the buggy and driving miriam to the garrison general williams called her by name and asked her about major drum it seems all these people native and foreign know us while we know none miriam told him our condition how our brothers were away father dead and mother afraid to remain yet unwilling to lose her property by going away how we three were alone and unprotected here but would remain rather than have our home confiscated he assured her the house should not be touched that it would be respected in our absence as though we were in it and he would place a sentinel at the door to guard it against his own men who might be disposed to enter the latter she declined but he said he would send his aide to mark the house that it might be known a moment after they got back the aide mr biddle i have his name to so many passes that i know it now came to the door mr tunnard left him there uncertain how we would receive a christian and i went out and asked him in he looked uncertain of his reception too when we put an end to his doubt by treating him as we invariably treat gentlemen who appear such he behaved remarkably well under the trying circumstances and insisted on a sentinel for he said though they would respect the property there were many bad characters among the soldiers who might attempt to rob it and the sentinel would protect it after a visit of ten minutes devoted exclusively to the affair he arose and took his leave leaving me under the impression that he was a gentleman wherever he came from even if there were a few grammatical errors in the pass he wrote me yesterday but thou that judgest another dost thou sin well now we say fly to greenwell yes and by tonight a most exaggerated account of the whole affair will be spread over the whole country and we will be equally suspected by our own people those who spread useless falsehoods about us will gladly have a foundation for a monstrous one did n't camp moore ring with the story of our entertaining the federal officers did n't they spread the report that miriam danced with one to the tune of yankee doodle in the state house garden what will they stop at now o if i was only a man and knew what to do night we were so distressed by the false position in which we would be placed by a federal sentinel that we did not know what course to pursue as all our friends shook their heads and said it was dangerous we knew full well what our enemies would say if we win baton rouge as i pray we will they will say we asked protection from yankees against our own men are consequently traitors and our property will be confiscated by our own government to decline general williams's kind offer exposes the house to being plundered in our dilemma we made up our minds to stay so we could say the sentinel was unnecessary presently a file of six soldiers marched to the gate an officer came to the steps and introduced himself as colonel mcmillan of 21st indiana volunteers he asked if this was mrs morgan's the general had ordered a guard placed around the house he would suggest placing them in different parts of the yard madam the pickets await your orders miriam in a desperate fright undertook to speak for mother and asked if he thought there was any necessity no but it was an additional security he said then if no actual necessity we will relieve you of the disagreeable duty as we expect to remain in town she said he was very kind and discussed the whole affair with us saying when we made up our minds to leave we told him after we could not decide to write him word and he would place a guard around to prevent his men and the negroes from breaking in it was a singular situation our brothers off fighting them while these federal officers leaned over our fence and an officer standing on our steps offered to protect us these people are certainly very kind to us general williams especially must be a dear old gentleman he is so good how many good and how many mean people these troubles have shown us i am beginning to see my true friends now there is a large number of them too everybody from whom we least expected attention has agreeably surprised us general williams will believe we are insane from our changing so often his guard positively refused june 5th last night i determined to stay miriam went after our trunks at daylight a few hours after lilly wrote we must go back mcclellan's army was cut to pieces and driven back to maryland by jackson the federals were being driven into the swamp from richmond too beauregard is undoubtedly coming to attack baton rouge his fire would burn the town if the gunboats do not the yankees will shell at all events if forced to retire it cannot stand we can't go to new orleans butler says he will lay it in ashes if he is forced to evacuate it from yellow fever or other causes both must be burned greenwell is not worth the powder it would cost so we must stand the chance of murder and starvation there rather than the certainty of being placed between two fires here well i see nothing but bloodshed and beggary staring us in the face let it come i hope to die shouting the lord will provide june 6th we dined at mrs brunot's yesterday and sitting on the gallery later had the full benefit of a yankee drill they stopped in front of the house and went through some very curious manoeuvres and then marched out to their drill ground beyond in returning the whole regiment drew up directly before us and we were dreadfully quiet for five minutes the most uncomfortable i have experienced for some time for it was absurd to look at the sky and i looked in vain for one man with downcast eyes whereon i might rest mine but from the officers down to the last private they were all looking at us i believe i would have cried with embarrassment if the command had not been given at that moment they drilled splendidly and knew it too so went through it as though they had not been at it for an hour before one conceited red headed lieutenant smiled at us in the most fascinating way perhaps he smiled to think how fine he was and what an impression he was making we got back to our solitary house before twilight and were sitting on the balcony when mr biddle entered he came to ask if the guard had been placed here last night it seems to me it would have saved him such a long walk if he had asked colonel mcmillan he sat down though and got talking in the moonlight and people passing some citizens some officers looked wonderingly at this unheard of occurrence i won't be rude to any one in my own house yankee or southern say what they will he talked a great deal and was very entertaining what tempted him i cannot imagine it was two hours before he thought of leaving he was certainly very kind he spoke of the scarcity of flour in town said they had quantities at the garrison and asked permission to send us a barrel which of course we refused it showed a very good heart though he offered to take charge of any letters i would write said he had heard general williams speak of harry and when he at last left i was still more pleased with him for this kindness to us he says captain huger is dead i am very very much distressed they are related he says he talked so reasonably of the war that it was quite a novelty after reading the abusive newspapers of both sides i like him and was sorry i could not ask him to repeat his visit we are unaccustomed to treat gentlemen that way but it won't do in the present state to act as we please mob governs mother kept me awake all night to listen to the mice in the garret every time i would doze she would ask what's that and insist that the mice were men i had to get up and look for an imaginary host so i am tired enough this morning miriam has just got in with all the servants our baggage is on the way so we will be obliged to stay whether we will or no i don't care it is all the same starve or burn oh i forgot mr biddle did not write that pass it was his clerk he speaks very grammatically so far as i can judge june 8th sunday these people mean to kill us with kindness there is such a thing as being too kind yesterday general williams sent a barrel of flour to mother accompanied by a note begging her to accept it in consideration of the present condition of the circulating currency and the intention was so kind the way it was done so delicate that there was no refusing it i had to write her thanks and got in a violent fit of the trembles at the idea of writing to a stranger one consolation is that i am not a very big fool for it took only three lines to prove myself one if i had been a thundering big one i would have occupied two pages to show myself fully and to think it is out of our power to prove them our appreciation of the kindness we have universally met with many officers were in church this morning and as they passed us while we waited for the door to be opened general williams bowed profoundly another followed his example we returned the salute of course but by to morrow those he did not bow to will cry treason against us let them howl i am tired of lies scandal and deceit all the loudest gossips have been frightened into the country but enough remain to keep them well supplied with town talk it is such a consolation to turn to the dear good people of the world after coming in contact with such cattle here for instance is mr bonnecase on whom we have not the slightest claims every day since we have been here he has sent a great pitcher of milk knowing our cow is out one day he sent rice the next sardines yesterday two bottles of port and madeira which cannot be purchased in the whole south what a duck of an old man that is only one instance june 10th this morning while i was attending to my flowers several soldiers stopped in front of me and holding on the fence commenced to talk about some brave colonel and a shooting affair last night when all had gone except one who was watching me attentively as he seemed to wish to tell me i let him go ahead the story was that colonel mcmillan was shot through the shoulder breast and liver by three guerrillas while four miles from town last night on a scout he was a quarter of a mile from his own men at the time killed one who shot him took the other two prisoners and fell from his horse himself when he got within the lines the soldier said these two guerrillas would probably be hanged while the six we saw pass captives sunday would probably be sent to fort jackson for life i think the guerrilla affair mere murder i confess but what a dreadful fate for these young men one who passed sunday was jimmy's schoolmate a boy of sixteen another willie garig the pet of a whole family of good honest country people these soldiers will get in the habit of talking to me after a while through my own fault yesterday i could not resist the temptation to ask the fate of the six guerrillas and stopped two volunteers who were going by to ask them they discussed the fate of the country told me fort pillow and vicksburg were evacuated the mississippi opened from source to mouth i told them of banks's and mcclellan's defeat they assured me it would all be over in a month which i fervently prey may be so told me they were from michigan one was mr bee he laid cousin of our general and they would probably have talked all day if i had not bowed myself away with thanks for their information it made me ashamed to contrast the quiet gentlemanly liberal way these volunteers spoke of us and our cause with the rabid fanatical abusive violence of our own female secession declaimers thank heaven i have never yet made my appearance as a billingsgate orator on these occasions all my violent feelings which in moments of intense excitement were really violent i have recorded in this book i am happy to say only the reasonable dislike to seeing my country subjugated has been confided to the public ear when necessary and that even now i confess that nothing but the reign of terror and gross prejudice by which i was surrounded at that time could justify many expressions i have here applied to them fact is these people have disarmed me by their kindness i expected to be in a crowd of ruffian soldiers who would think nothing of cutting your throat or doing anything they felt like and i find among all these thousands not one who offers the slightest annoyance or disrespect the former is the thing as it is believed by the whole country the latter the true state of affairs i admire foes who show so much consideration for our feelings contrast these with our volunteers from new orleans all gentlemen who came to take the garrison from major haskins several of them passing our gate where we were standing with the brunots one exclaimed what pretty girls it was a stage aside that we were supposed not to hear yes said another beautiful but they look as though they could be fast fast and we were not even speaking not even looking at them sophie and i were walking presently and met half a dozen we had to stop to let them pass the crossing they did not think of making way for us no 1 sighed such a sigh no 2 followed and so on when they all sighed in chorus for our edification while we dared not raise our eyes from the ground that is the time i would have made use of a dagger two passed in a buggy and trusting to our not recognizing them from the rapidity of their vehicle kissed their hands to us until they were out of sight all went back to new orleans vowing baton rouge had the prettiest girls in the world these were our own people the élite of new orleans loyal southerners and gentlemen these northerners pass us satisfied with a simple glance some take off their hats for all these officers know our name though we may not know theirs how i can't say when i heard of colonel mcmillan's misfortune mother conspired with me to send over some bandages and something tiche manufactured of flour under the name of nourishment for he is across the street at heroman's miriam objected on account of what our people will say and what we will suffer for it if the guerrillas reach town but we persuaded her we were right you can imagine our condition at present many years hence sarah when you reflect that it is the brave noble hearted generous miriam who is afraid to do that deed on account of public opinion which indeed is down on us at greenwell they are frantic about our returning to town and call us traitors yankees and vow vengeance a lady said to me the guerrillas have a black list containing the names of those remaining in town all the men are to be hanged their houses burned and all the women are to be tarred and feathered i said madam if i believed them capable of such a vile threat even much less the execution i would see them cut down without a feeling of compassion which is not true and swear i was a yankee rather than claim being a native of the same country with such brutes she has a long tongue when i next hear of it it will be that i told the story and called them brutes and hoped they would be shot etc and so goes the world no one will think of saying that i did not believe them guilty of the thought even our three brothers may be sick or wounded at this minute what i do for this man god will send some one to do for them and with that belief i do it june 11th last evening mother and miriam went to the arsenal to see if they would be allowed to do anything for the prisoners general williams received them and fascinated miriam by his manner as usual poor miriam is always being fascinated according to her own account he sent for little nathan castle and willie garig and left them alone in the room with them showing his confidence and delicacy by walking away the poor young men were very grateful to be remembered one had his eyes too full of tears to speak mr garig told miriam that when the story of her refusing the escort was told in camp the woods rang with shouts of three cheers for miss morgan they said they were treated very well and had no want except clean clothes and to let their mothers know they were well and content i have been hard at work mending three or four suits of the boys clothing for those poor young men some needed thread and needle very much but it was the best we could do so i packed them all up not forgetting a row of pins and sent tiche off with the bundle perched real congo fashion on her many colored head handkerchief which was tied in the most superb creole style in honor of the occasion june 16th monday my poor old diary comes to a very abrupt end to my great distress the hardest thing in the world is to break off journalizing when you are once accustomed to it and mine has proved such a resource to me in these dark days of trouble that i feel as though i were saying good bye to an old and tried friend thanks to my liberal supply of pens ink and paper how many inexpressibly dreary days i have filled up to my own satisfaction if not to that of others how many disagreeable affairs it has caused me to pass over without another thought how many times it has proved a relief to me where my tongue was forced to remain quiet without the blessed materials i would have fallen victim to despair and the blues long since but they have kept my eyes fixed on better days a coming while slightly alluding to present woes kept me from making a fool of myself many a day acted as lightning rod to my mental thunder and have made me happy generally for all of which i cry vivent pen ink and paper and add with regret adieu my mental conductor i fear this unchained lightning will strike somewhere in your absence i hope to die shouting the lord will provide monday june 16th 1862 there is no use in trying to break off journalizing particularly in these trying times it has become a necessity to me i believe i should go off in a rapid decline if butler took it in his head to prohibit that among other things i reserve to myself the privilege of writing my opinions since i trouble no one with the expression of them i insist that if the valor and chivalry of our men cannot save our country i would rather have it conquered by a brave race than owe its liberty to the billingsgate oratory and demonstrations of some of these ladies if the women have the upper hand then as they have now i would not like to live in a country governed by such tongues do i consider the female who could spit in a gentleman's face merely because he wore united states buttons as a fit associate for me lieutenant biddle assured me he did not pass a street in new orleans without being most grossly insulted by ladies it was a friend of his into whose face a lady spit as he walked quietly by without looking at her wonder if she did it to attract his attention he had the sense to apply to her husband and give him two minutes to apologize or die and of course he chose the former 1 such things are enough to disgust any one loud women what a contempt i have for you how i despise your vulgarity some of these ultra secessionists evidently very recently from down east who think themselves obliged to kick up their heels over the bonny blue flag as brother describes female patriotism shriek out what see those vile northerners pass patiently no true southerner could see it without rage i could kill them i hate them with all my soul the murderers liars thieves rascals you are no southerner if you do not hate them as much as i ah ça a true blue yankee tell me that i born and bred here am no southerner i always think it is well for you my friend to save your credit else you might be suspected by some people though your violence is enough for me i always say you may do as you please my brothers are fighting for me and doing their duty so that excess of patriotism is unnecessary for me as my position is too well known to make any demonstrations requisite this war has brought out wicked malignant feelings that i did not believe could dwell in woman's heart i see some of the holiest eyes so holy one would think the very spirit of charity lived in them and all christian meekness go off in a mad tirade of abuse and say with the holy eyes wondrously changed i hope god will send down plague yellow fever famine on these vile yankees and that not one will escape death o what unutterable horror that remark causes me as often as i hear it i think of the many mothers wives and sisters who wait as anxiously pray as fervently in their faraway homes for their dear ones as we do here i fancy them waiting day after day for the footsteps that will never come growing more sad lonely and heart broken as the days wear on i think of how awful it would be if one would say your brothers are dead how it would crush all life and happiness out of me and i say god forgive these poor women they know not what they say o women into what loathsome violence you have abased your holy mission god will punish us for our hard heartedness not a square off in the new theatre lie more than a hundred sick soldiers what woman has stretched out her hand to save them to give them a cup of cold water where is the charity which should ignore nations and creeds and administer help to the indian and heathen indifferently gone all gone in a union versus secession that is what the american war has brought us if i was independent if i could work my own will without causing others to suffer for my deeds i would not be poring over this stupid page i would not be idly reading or sewing i would put aside woman's trash take up woman's duty and i would stand by some forsaken man and bid him godspeed as he closes his dying eyes that is woman's mission and not preaching and politics i say i would yet here i sit o for liberty the liberty that dares do what conscience dictates and scorns all smaller rules if i could help these dying men yet it is as impossible as though i was a chained bear i can't put out my hand i am threatened with coventry because i sent a custard to a sick man who is in the army and with the anathema of society because i said if i could possibly do anything for mr biddle at a distance he is sick i would like to very much charlie thinks we have acted shockingly in helping colonel mcmillan and that we will suffer for it when the federals leave i would like to see any man who dared harm my father's daughter but as he seems to think our conduct reflects on him there is no alternative die poor men without a woman's hand to close your eyes we women are too patriotic to help you i look eagerly on cry in my soul i wish you die god judges me behold the woman who dares not risk private ties for god's glory and her professed religion coward helpless woman that i am if i was free june 17th yesterday and day before boats were constantly arriving and troops embarking from here destined for vicksburg there will be another fight and of course it will fall i wish will was out of it i don't want him to die i got the kindest sweetest letter from will when miriam came from greenwell it was given to her by a guerrilla on the road who asked if she was not miss sarah morgan june 18th how long o how long is it since i have lain down in peace thinking this night i will rest in safety certainly not since the fall of fort jackson if left to myself i would not anticipate evil but would quietly await the issue of all these dreadful events but when i hear men who certainly should know better than i express their belief that in twenty four hours the town will be laid in ashes i begin to grow uneasy and think it must be so since they say it these last few days since the news arrived of the intervention of the english and french i have alternately risen and fallen from the depth of despair to the height of delight and expectation as the probability of another exodus diminishes and peace appears more probable if these men would not prophesy the burning of the city i would be perfectly satisfied well i packed up a few articles to satisfy my conscience since these men insist that another run is inevitable though against my own conviction i am afraid i was partly influenced by my dream last night of being shelled out unexpectedly and flying without saving an article it was the same dream i had a night or two before we fled so ingloriously from baton rouge when i dreamed of meeting will pinckney suddenly who greeted me in the most extraordinarily affectionate manner and told me that vicksburg had fallen he said he had been chiefly to blame and the southerners were so incensed at his losing the northerners at his defending that both were determined to hang him he was running for his life he took me to a hill from which i could see the garrison and the american flag flying over it i looked and saw we were standing in blood up to our knees while here and there ghastly white bones shone above the red surface just then below me i saw crowds of people running what is it i asked it means that in another instant they will commence to shell the town save yourself but will i must save some clothes too how can i go among strangers with a single dress i will get some i cried he smiled and said you will run with only what articles you happen to have on bang went the first shell the people rushed by with screams and i awakened to tell miriam what an absurd dream i had had it happened as will had said either that same day or the day after for the change of clothes we saved apiece were given to tiche who lost sight of us and quietly came home when all was over and the two dirty skirts and old cloak mother saved after carrying them a mile and a half i put in the buggy that took her up so i saved nothing except the bag that was tied under my hoops will was right i saved not even my powder bag tiche had it in the bundle my handkerchief i gave mother before we had walked three squares and throughout that long fearfully warm day riding and walking through the fiery sunshine and stifling dust i had neither to cool or comfort me june 19th miriam and i have disgraced ourselves this morning i was quietly hearing dellie's lessons when i was startled by mother's shrieks of send for a guard they've murdered him i saw through the window a soldier sitting in the road just opposite with blood streaming from his hand in a great pool in the dust i was downstairs in three bounds and snatching up some water ran to where he sat alone not a creature near though all the inhabitants of our side of the street were looking on from the balconies all crying murder and help without moving themselves i poured some water on the man's bloody hand as he held it streaming with gore up to me saying the man in there did it meaning the one who keeps the little grog shop though it puzzled me at the time to see that all the doors were closed and not a face visible i had hardly time to speak when tiche called loudly to me to come away she was safe at the front gate and looking up i found myself in a knot of a dozen soldiers and took her advice and retreated home it proved to be the guard miriam had roused she ran out as i did and seeing a gentleman begged him to call the guard for that murdered man the individual he must have been a patriot said he did n't know where to find one she cried out they were at heroman's he said he did n't believe they were go i tell you she screamed at last but the brave man said he did n't like to so she ran to the corner and called the soldiers herself o most brave man before we got back from our several expeditions we heard mother lilly mrs day all shouting bring in the children lock the doors etc all for a poor wounded soldier we after discovered that the man was drunk and had cursed the woman of the grog shop whereupon her husband had pitched him out in the street where they found him they say he hurt his hand against a post but wood could never have cut deep enough to shed all that gore i don't care if he was drunk or sober soldier or officer federal or confederate if he had been satan himself lying helpless and bleeding in the street i would have gone to him i can't believe it was as criminal as though i had watched quietly from a distance believing him dying and contenting myself with looking on yet it seems it was dreadfully indecorous miriam and i did very wrong we should have shouted murder with the rest of the women and servants whereas the man who declined committing himself by calling one soldier to the rescue of another supposed to be dying acted most discreetly and showed his wisdom in the most striking manner may i never be discreet or wise if this is christian conduct or a sample of either i would rather be a rash impetuous fool charlie says he would not open his mouth to save a dozen from being murdered i say i am not stoic enough for that lilly agrees with him miriam with me so here we two culprits stand alone before the tribunal of patriotism madame roland i take the liberty of altering your words and cry o patriotism how many base deeds are sanctioned by your name don't i wish i was a heathen in twenty four hours the whole country will be down on us o for a pen to paint the slaves whose country like a deadly blight closes all hearts when pity craves and turns god's spirit to darkest night may life's patriotic cup for such be filled with glory overmuch and when their spirits go above in pride spirit of patriotism let these valiant abide full in the sight of grand mass meeting i don't want you to cuss them but put them where they can hear politics and yet can't discuss them i can't say worse than that june 26th yesterday morning just as i stepped out of bed i heard the report of four cannon fired in rapid succession and everybody asked everybody else did you hear that so significantly that i must say my heart beat very rapidly for a few moments at the thought of another stampede at half past six this morning i was wakened by another report followed by seven others and heard again the question did you hear that on a higher key than yesterday it did not take me many minutes to get out of bed and to slip on a few articles i confess my chief desire was to wash my face before running if they were actually shelling us again it appears that they were only practicing however and no harm was intended but we are living on such a volcano that not knowing what to expect we are rather nervous i am afraid this close confinement will prove too much for me my long walks are cut off on account of the soldiers one month to morrow since my last visit to the graveyard that haunts me always it must be so dreary out there here is a sketch of my daily life enough to finish me off forever if much longer persisted in first get up a little before seven after breakfast which is generally within a few minutes after i get down it used to be just as i got ready and sometimes before last winter i attend to my garden which consists of two strips of ground the length of the house in front where i can find an hour's work in examining and admiring my flowers replanting those that the cows and horses occasionally once a day pull up for me and in turning the soil over and over again to see which side grows best o my garden abode of rare delights how many pleasant hours i have passed in you armed with scissors knife hoe or rake only pausing when mr this or mr that leaned over the fence to have a talk last spring that was ever so many are dead now for all i know and all off at the war now i work for the edification of proper young women who look in astonishment at me as they would consider themselves degraded by the pursuit a delicate pair of hands my flower mania will leave me then i hear dellie's and morgan's lessons after which i open my desk and am lost in the mysteries of arithmetic geography blair's lectures noël et chapsal ollendorff and reading aloud in french and english besides writing occasionally in each and sometimes a peep at lavoisne until very nearly dinner the day is not half long enough for me many things i would like to study i am forced to give up for want of leisure to devote to them but one of these days i will make up for present deficiencies i study only what i absolutely love now but then if i can i will study what i am at present ignorant of and cultivate a taste for something new the few moments before dinner and all the time after i devote to writing sewing knitting etc and if i included darning repairs alterations etc my list would be tremendous for i get through with a great deal of sewing somewhere in the day i find half an hour or more to spend at the piano before sunset i dress and am free to spend the evening at home or else walk to mrs brunot's for it is not safe to go farther than those three squares away from home from early twilight until supper miriam and i sing with the guitar generally and after sit comfortably under the chandelier and read until about ten what little reading i do is almost exclusively done at that time it sounds woefully little but my list of books grows to quite a respectable size in the course of a year at ten comes my bible class for the servants lucy rose nancy and dophy assemble in my room and hear me read the bible or stories from the bible for a while then one by one say their prayers they cannot be persuaded to say them together dophy says she can't say with rose cause she ain't got no brothers and sisters to pray for and lucy has no father or mother and so they go all difficulties and grievances during the day are laid before me and i sit like moses judging the children of israel until i can appease the discord sometimes it is not so easy for instance that memorable night when i had to work rose's stubborn heart to a proper pitch of repentance for having stabbed a carving fork in lucy's arm in a fit of temper i don't know that i was ever as much astonished as i was at seeing the dogged sullen girl throw herself on the floor in a burst of tears and say if god would forgive her she would never do it again i was lashing myself internally for not being able to speak as i should furious at myself for talking so weakly and lo here the girl tumbles over wailing and weeping and dophy overcome by her feelings sobs lucy i scratched you last week please forgive me this once and amazed and bewildered i look at the touching tableau before me of kissing and reconciliation for lucy can bear malice toward no one and is ready to forgive before others repent and i look from one to the other wondering what it was that upset them so completely for certainly no words of mine caused it sometimes lucy sings a wild hymn did you ever hear the heaven bells ring come my loving brothers when i put on my starry crown etc and after some such scene as that just described it is pleasant to hear them going out of the room saying good night miss sarah god bless miss sarah and all that june 27th a proclamation of van dorn has just been smuggled into town that advises all persons living within eight miles of the mississippi to remove into the interior as he is determined to defend his department at all hazards to the last extremity does not look like the peace i have been deluding myself with does it that means another exodus how are we to leave when we are not allowed to pass the limits of the corporation by the federals where are we to go we are between the two armies and here we must remain patiently awaiting the result some of these dark nights bang we will hear the cannon and then it will be sauve qui peut in a shower of shells bah i don't believe god will suffer that we should be murdered in such a dreadful way i don't believe he will suffer us to be turned homeless and naked on the world something will turn up before we are attacked and we will be spared i am certain we can't look forward more than an hour at a time now sometimes not a minute ahead witness the shelling frolic so i must resume my old habit of laying a clean dress on my bed before going to sleep which i did every night for six weeks before the shelling of baton rouge in order to run respectably as muslin cross bar nightgowns are not suitable for day dresses june 28th i am afraid i shall be nervous when the moment of the bombardment actually arrives this suspense is not calculated to soothe one's nerves a few moments since a salute was fired in honor of general butler's arrival when women children and servants rushed to the front of the houses confident of a repetition of the shelling which occurred a month ago to day the children have not forgotten the scene for they all actually howled with fear poor little sarah stopped her screams to say mother don't you wish we was dogs stead o white folks in such piteous accents that we had to laugh don't i wish i was a dog sarah is right i don't know if i showed my uneasiness a while ago but certainly my heart has hardly yet ceased beating rather rapidly if i knew what moment to expect the stampede i would not mind but this way to expect it every instant it is too much again if i knew where we could go for refuge from the shells a window banging unexpectedly just then gave me a curious twinge not that i thought it was the signal oh dear no i just thought what i wonder pshaw picayune butler's coming coming has upset my nervous system he interrupted me in the middle of my arithmetic and i have not the energy to resume my studies i shall try what effect an hour's practice will have on my spirits and will see that i have a pair of clean stockings in my stampede sack and that the fastenings of my running bag are safe though if i expect to take either i should keep in harness constantly how long o lord how long june 29th sunday any more mr lincoln any more can't you leave our racked homes in repose we are all wild last night five citizens were arrested on no charge at all and carried down to picayune butler's ship what a thrill of terror ran through the whole community we all felt so helpless so powerless under the hand of our tyrant the man who swore to uphold the constitution and the laws who is professedly only fighting to give us all liberty the birthright of every american and who nevertheless has ground us down to a state where we would not reduce our negroes who tortures and sneers at us and rules us with an iron hand ah liberty what a humbug i would rather belong to england or france than to the north bondage woman that i am i can never stand even now the northern papers distributed among us taunt us with our subjection and tell us how coolly butler will grind them down paying no regard to their writhing and torture beyond tightening the bonds still more ah truly this is the bitterness of slavery to be insulted and reviled by cowards who are safe at home and enjoy the protection of the laws while we captive and overpowered dare not raise our voices to throw back the insult and are governed by the despotism of one man whose word is our law and that man they tell us is the right man in the right place he will develop a union sentiment among the people if the thing can be done come and see if he can hear the curse that arises from thousands of hearts at that man's name and say if he will speedily bring us to our senses will he accomplish it by love tenderness mercy compassion he might have done it but did he try when he came he assumed his natural rôle as tyrant and bravely has he acted it through never once turning aside for justice or mercy this degradation is worse than the bitterness of death i see no salvation on either side no glory awaits the southern confederacy even if it does achieve its independence it will be a mere speck in the world with no weight or authority the north confesses itself lost without us and has paid an unheard of ransom to regain us on the other hand conquered what hope is there in this world for us broken in health and fortune reviled contemned abused by those who claim already to have subdued us without a prospect of future support for those few of our brothers who return outcasts without home or honor would not death or exile be preferable oh let us abandon our loved home to these implacable enemies and find refuge elsewhere take from us property everything only grant us liberty is this rather frantic considering i abhor politics and women who meddle with them above all my opinion has not yet changed i still feel the same contempt for a woman who would talk at the top of her voice for the edification of federal officers as though anxious to receive an invitation requesting her presence at the garrison i can suffer and be still as far as outward signs are concerned but as no word of this has passed my lips i give it vent in writing which is more lasting than words partly to relieve my heart partly to prove to my own satisfaction that i am no coward for one line of this surrounded as we are by soldiers and liable to have our houses searched at any instant would be a sufficient indictment for high treason under general williams's rule i was perfectly satisfied that whatever was done was done through necessity and under orders from headquarters beyond his control we all liked him but now since butler's arrival i believe i am as frantic in secret as the others are openly i know that war sanctions many hard things and that both sides practice them but now we are so completely lost in louisiana is it fair to gibe and taunt us with our humiliation i could stand anything save the cowardly ridicule and triumph of their papers honestly i believe if all vile abusive papers on both sides were suppressed and some of the fire eating editors who make a living by lying were soundly cowhided or had their ears clipped it would do more towards establishing peace than all the bloodshedding either side can afford i hope to live to see it too seems to me more liberty is allowed to the press than would be tolerated in speech let us speak as freely as any paper and see if to morrow we do not sleep at fort jackson this morning the excitement is rare fifteen more citizens were arrested and carried off and all the rest grew wild with expectation so great a martyrdom is it considered that i am sure those who are not arrested will be woefully disappointed it is ludicrous to see how each man thinks he is the very one they are in search of we asked a twopenny lawyer of no more importance in the community than dophy is if it was possible he was not arrested but i am expecting to be every instant so much for his self assurance those arrested have some been quietly released those are so smiling and mysterious that i suspect them some been obliged to take the oath some sent to fort jackson ah liberty what a blessing it is to enjoy thy privileges if some of these poor men are not taken prisoners they will die of mortification at the slight our valiant governor the brave moore has by order of the real governor moïse made himself visible at some far distant point and issued a proclamation saying whereas we of baton rouge were held forcibly in town he therefore considered men women and children prisoners of war and as such the yankees are bound to supply us with all necessaries and consequently any one sending us aid or comfort or provisions from the country will be severely punished only moore is fool enough for such an order held down by the federals our paper money so much trash with hardly any other to buy food and no way of earning it threatened with starvation and utter ruin our own friends by way of making our burden lighter forbid our receiving the means of prolonging life and after generously warning us to leave town which they know is perfectly impossible prepare to burn it over our heads and let the women run the same risk as the men penned in on one little square mile here we await our fate like sheep in the slaughter pen our hour may be at hand now it may be to night we have only to wait the booming of the cannon will announce it to us soon enough of the six sentenced to fort jackson one is the methodist minister mr craven the only charge is that he was heard to pray for the confederate states by some officers who passed his house during his family prayers according to that which of us would escape unhung i do not believe there is a woman in the land who closes her eyes before praying for god's blessing on the side on which her brothers are engaged are we all to cease show me the dungeon deep enough to keep me from praying for them the man represented that he had a large family totally dependent on him who must starve let them get up a subscription was general butler's humane answer i will head it myself it is useless to say the generous offer was declined june 30th as a specimen of the humanity of general butler let me record a threat of his uttered with all the force and meaning language can convey and certainly enough to strike terror in the hearts of frail women since all these men believe him fully equal to carry it into execution some even believe it will be done in speaking to mr solomon benjamin of foreign intervention in our favor he said let england or france try it and i'll be if i don't arm every negro in the south and make them cut the throat of every man woman and child in it i'll make them lay the whole country waste with fire and sword and leave it desolate draw me a finer picture of coward brute or bully than that one sentence portrays o men of the north you do your noble hearts wrong in sending such ruffians among us as the representatives of a great people was ever a more brutal thought uttered in a more brutal way mother like many another is crazy to go away from here even to new orleans but like the rest will be obliged to stand and await her fate i don't believe butler would dare execute his threat for at the first attempt thousands who are passive now would cut the brutal heart from his inhuman breast
june 9th tuesday my dear brother who is always seeking to make somebody happy arranged a dinner party at the lake for us saturday there was quite a number of us as besides ourselves and the five children we had mrs price and her children mrs bull and three nurses there are no southern young men left in town and those who remain would hardly be received with civility by miriam and myself of the yankees brother has so much consideration for us that he has never invited one to his house since we have been here though he has many friends among them who visited here before our arrival such delicacy of feeling we fully appreciate knowing how very few men of such a hospitable nature would be capable of such a sacrifice thinking we need company brother frequently invites what he calls a safe old secessionist an old bachelor of fifty three who was wounded at shiloh to dine with us thinking it a fair compromise between the stay at home youth and the yankees neither of whom this extremely young man could be confounded with sunday june 14th the excitement about port hudson and vicksburg is intense when i heard on friday that the last attack was being made on the former place i took to my prayers with a delirium of fervor if i was a man if i had the blessed privilege of fighting i would be on the breastworks or perchance on the water batteries under colonel steadman's command but as i was unfortunately born a woman i stay home and pray with heart and soul that is all i can do but i do it with a will in my excitement i was wishing that i was a catholic that i might make a vow for the preservation of port hudson when a brilliant idea struck me it was this though vows are peculiar to catholics mosquitoes are common to all sects from that arose this heroic scheme i said hear me miriam thou who knowest i have slept undisturbed but three nights out of seventeen four hours out of each of the other fourteen having been spent in destroying my insatiable foe thou seest that nightly vigils are torturing me pale and weak thou knowest what unspeakable affection i have for the youth yclept by the ancients morpheus yet listen to my vow if port hudson holds out if our dear people are victorious i offer up myself on the altar of my country to mosquitoes and never again will i murmur at their depredations and voracity talk of pilgrimages and the ordinary vow of wearing only the virgin's colors the most becoming in the world there never was one of greater heroism or more sublime self sacrifice than this and as if to prove my sincerity they have been worse than ever these last two nights but as yet i have not murmured for the yankees who swore to enter port hudson before last monday night have not yet fulfilled their promise and we hold it still vivent vows and mosquitoes and forever may our flag wave over the entrenchments we will conquer yet with god's blessing a week or ten days ago came a letter from lydia who is placed within the lines by this recent raid she writes that the sugar house and quarters have been seized for yankee hospitals that they have been robbed of their clothing and that they are in pursuit of the general who i pray heaven may escape them she wrote for clothing provisions and a servant and after we had procured them all and were ready to send them we discovered that they would not be allowed to pass so i hardly know what the poor child will do unless she accepts brother's invitation to come down to him immediately if she thinks it right june 17th i must write something somewhere i don't care if dinner is ready and brother's safe old secesh downstairs lydia has another boy letter has just come and i am demented about my new godchild there now feel better one more word it shall be called howell dear blessed little baby how i shall love it sunday june 21st how about that oath of allegiance is what i frequently ask myself and always an uneasy qualm of conscience troubles me guilty or not guilty of perjury according to the law of god in the abstract and of nations yes according to my conscience jeff davis and the peculiar position i was placed in no which is it had i had any idea that such a pledge would be exacted would i have been willing to come never the thought would have horrified me the reality was never placed before me until we reached bonfouca there i was terrified at the prospect but seeing how impossible it would be to go back i placed all my hopes in some miracle that was to intervene to prevent such a crime and confidently believed my ill health or something else would save me while all the rest of the party declared they would think it nothing and take forty oaths a day if necessary a forced oath all men agree is not binding the yankees lay particular stress on this being voluntary and insist that no one is solicited to take it except of their own free will yet look at the scene that followed when mother showed herself unwilling think of being ordered to the custom house as a prisoner for saying she supposed she would have to that's liberty that is free will it is entirely optional you have only to take it quietly or go to jail that is freedom enough certainly there was not even that choice left to me i told the officer who took down my name that i was unwilling to take the oath and asked if there was no escaping it none whatever was his reply you have it to do and there is no getting out of it his rude tone frightened me into half crying but for all that as he said i had it to do if perjury it is which will god punish me who was unwilling to commit the crime or the man who forced me to it friday june 26th o praise the lord o my soul here is good news enough to make me happy for a month brother is so good about that every time he hears good news on our side he tells it just as though it was on his side instead of on ours while all bad news for us he carefully avoids mentioning unless we question him so to day he brought in a budget for us lee has crossed the potomac on his way to washington with one hundred and sixty thousand men gibbes and george are with him magruder is marching on fort jackson to attack it in the rear one or two of our english ironclads are reported at the mouth of the river and farragut has gone down to capture them o jimmy jimmy suppose he should be on one of them we don't know the name of his ship and it makes us so anxious for him during these months that we have heard nothing of his whereabouts it is so delightful to see these frightened yankees one has only to walk downtown to be satisfied of the alarm that reigns yesterday came the tidings of the capture of brashere city by our troops and that a brigade was fifteen miles above here coming down to the city men congregated at corners whispering cautiously these were evidently confederates who had taken the oath solitary yankees straggled along with the most lugubrious faces troubling no one we walked down to blineau's with mrs price and over our ice cream she introduced her husband who is a true blue union man though she like ourselves is a rank rebel mr price on the eve of making an immense fortune was perfectly disconsolate at the news every one was to be ruined starvation would follow if the confederates entered there was never a more dismal unhappy creature enchanted at the news i naturally asked if it were reliable perfectly why to prove how true standing at the door of this salon five minutes ago i saw two young ladies pass with confederate flags which they flirted in the face of some federal officers unrebuked verily thought i something is about to happen two days ago the girls who were unrebuked this evening would have found themselves in jail instead july 10th shall i cry faint scream or go off in hysterics tell me which quickly for to doubt this news is fine and imprisonment and if i really believe it i would certainly give way to my feelings and commit some vagaries of the kind my resolution is formed i will do neither i won't gratify the yankees so much i have been banging at the piano until my fingers are weary and singing the secret through life to be happy until my voice is cracked i'll stand on my head if necessary to prove my indifference but i'll never believe this is true until it is confirmed by stronger authority day before yesterday came tidings that vicksburg had fallen on the 4th inst the era poured out extras and sundry little popguns fizzled out salutes all who doubted the truth of the report and were brave enough to say so were fined or imprisoned it has become a penal offense to doubt what the era says so quite a number of arrests were made this morning it was followed up by the announcement of the capture of port hudson the guns are pealing for true and the yankees at headquarters may be seen skipping like lambs for very joy and i still disbelieve skeptic the first thing i know that era man will be coming here to convert me but i don't can't won't believe it if it is true but i find consolation in this faith it is either true or not true if it is true it is all for the best and if it is not true it is better still whichever it is is for some wise purpose so it does not matter so we wait pray and believe 5 o'clock p.m i don't believe it what am i crying about then it seems so hard how the mighty are fallen port hudson gone brother believes it that is enough for me god bless him i cry hourly he is so good and considerate he told me name your friends and what can be done for them shall be attended to the prisoners will be sent here maybe i cannot do much but food and clothing you shall have in abundance for them when they arrive god bless him for his kindness o dear noble men i am afraid to meet them i should do something foolish best take my cry out in private now may the lord look down in pity on us port hudson does not matter so much but these brave noble creatures the era says they had devoured their last mule before they surrendered saturday july 10th 10 o'clock p.m i preach patience but how about practice i am exasperated there is the simple fact and is it not enough what a scene i have just witnessed a motley crew of thousands of low people of all colors parading the streets with flags torches music and all other accompaniments shouting screaming exulting over the fall of port hudson and vicksburg the era will call it an enthusiastic demonstration of the loyal citizens of the city we who saw it from upper balconies know of what rank these citizens were we saw crowds of soldiers mixed up with the lowest rabble in the town workingmen in dirty clothes newsboys ragged children negroes and even women walking in the procession while swarms of negroes and low white women elbowed each other in a dense mass on the pavement to see such creatures exulting over our misfortune was enough to make one scream with rage one of their dozen transparencies was inscribed with a dead confederacy fools the flames are smouldering they will burst out presently and consume you more than half much more were negroes as they passed by here they raised a yell of down with the rebels that made us gnash our teeth in silence the devil possessed me o miriam help me pray the dear lord that their flag may burn i whispered as the torches danced around it and we did pray earnestly so earnestly that miriam's eyes were tightly screwed up but it must have been a wicked prayer for it was not answered dr s has out a magnificent display of black cotton grammatically inscribed with port hudson and vicksburg is ours garnished with a luminous row of tapers and drunk on two bits worth of lager beer he has been shrieking out all union songs he can think of with his horrid children until my tympanum is perfectly cracked miriam wants to offer him an extra bottle of lager for the two places of which he claims the monopoly he would sell his creed for less miriam is dying to ask him what he has done with the confederate uniform he sported before the yankees came his son says they are all union men over there and will lemonate illuminate to night a starving seamstress opposite has stuck six tallow candles in her window better put them in her stomach and i won't believe vicksburg has surrendered port hudson i am sure has fallen alas for all hopes of serving the brave creatures the rumor is that they have been released on parole happily for them but if it must go what a blessed privilege it would have been to aid or comfort them
tuesday july 1st i heard such a good joke last night if i had belonged to the female declaiming club i fear me i would have resigned instantly through mere terror thank heaven i don't these officers say the women talk too much which is undeniable they then said they meant to get up a sewing society and place in it every woman who makes herself conspicuous by her loud talking about them fancy what a refinement of torture but only a few would suffer the majority would be only too happy to enjoy the usual privilege of sewing societies slander abuse and insinuations how some would revel in it the mere threat makes me quake if i could so far forget my dignity and my father's name as to court the notice of gentlemen by contemptible insult etc and if i should be ordered to take my seat at the sewing society i would never hold my head up again member of a select sewing circle fancy me i know there is never any gossip in our society though the one over the way gets up dreadful reports i have heard all that but would rather try neither oh how i would beg and plead fifty years at fort jackson good kind general butler rather than half an hour in your sewing society gentle humane ruler spare me and i split my throat in shouting yankee doodle and hurrah for lincoln any every thing so i am not disgraced deliver me from your sewing society and i'll say and do what you please butler told some of these gentlemen that he had a detective watching almost every house in town and he knew everything true or not it looks suspicious we are certainly watched every evening two men may be seen in the shadow on the other side of the street standing there until ever so late sometimes until after we have gone to bed it may be that far from home they are attracted by the bright light and singing and watch us for their amusement a few nights ago so many officers passed and repassed while we were singing on the balcony that i felt as though our habit of long standing had suddenly become improper saturday night having secured a paper we were all crowding around lilly and i reading every now and then a piece of news from opposite ends of the paper charlie walking on the balcony found five officers leaning over the fence watching us as we stood under the light through the open window hope they won't elect me to the sewing society thursday night july 3d another day of sickening suspense this evening about three came the rumor that there was to be an attack on the town to night or early in the morning and we had best be prepared for anything i can't say i believe it but in spite of my distrust i made my preparations first of all i made a charming improvement in my knapsack alias pillow case by sewing a strong black band down each side of the centre from the bottom to the top when it is carried back and fastened below again allowing me to pass my arms through and thus present the appearance of an old peddler miriam's i secured also and tied all our laces in a handkerchief ready to lay it in the last thing but the interior of my bag what a medley it is first i believe i have secured four underskirts three chemises as many pairs of stockings two underbodies the prayer book father gave me tennyson that harry gave me when i was fourteen two unmade muslins a white mull english grenadine trimmed with lilac and a purple linen and nightgown then i must have lavinia's daguerreotype and how could i leave will's when perhaps he was dead besides howell's and will carter's were with him and one single case did not matter but there was tom barker's i would like to keep and oh let's take mr stone's and i can't slight mr dunnington for these two have been too kind to jimmy for me to forget and poor captain huger is dead and i will keep his so they all went together a box of pens too was indispensable and a case of french notepaper and a bundle of harry's letters were added miriam insisted on the old diary that preceded this and found place for it though i am afraid if she knew what trash she was to carry she would retract before going farther it makes me heartsick to see the utter ruin we will be plunged in if forced to run to night not a hundredth part of what i most value can be saved if i counted my letters and papers not a thousandth but i cannot believe we will run to night the soldiers tell whoever questions them that there will be a fight before morning but i believe it must be to alarm them though what looks suspicious is that the officers said to whom is not stated that the ladies must not be uneasy if they heard cannon tonight as they would probably commence to celebrate the fourth of july about twelve o'clock what does it mean i repeat i don't believe a word of it yet i have not yet met the woman or child who is not prepared to fly rose knocked at the door just now to show her preparations her only thought seems to be mother's silver so she has quietly taken possession of our shoe bag which is a long sack for odds and ends with cases for shoes outside and has filled it with all the contents of the silver box this hung over her arm and carrying louis and sarah this young samson says she will be ready to fly i don't believe it yet here i sit my knapsack serving me for a desk my seat the chair on which i have carefully spread my clothes in order at my elbow lies my running or treasure bag surrounded by my cabas filled with hair pins starch and a band i was embroidering etc near it lie our combs etc and the whole is crowned by my dagger by the way i must add miriam's pistol which she has forgotten though over there lies her knapsack ready too with our bonnets and veils it is long past eleven and no sound of the cannon bah i do not expect it i'll lay me down and sleep in peace for thou only lord makest me to dwell in safety good night i wake up to morrow the same as usual and be disappointed that my trouble was unnecessary july 4th here i am and still alive having wakened but once in the night and that only in consequence of louis and morgan crying nothing more alarming than that i ought to feel foolish but i do not i am glad i was prepared even though there was no occasion for it while i was taking my early bath lilly came to the bath house and told me through the weather boarding of another battle stonewall jackson has surrounded mcclellan completely and victory is again ours this is said to be the sixth battle he has fought in twenty days and they say he has won them all and the seventh regiment distinguished itself and was presented with four cannon on the battlefield in acknowledgment of its gallant conduct gibbes belongs to the ragged howling regiment that rushed on the field yelling like unchained devils and spread a panic through the army as the northern papers said describing the battle of manassas oh how i hope he has escaped and they say palmerston has urged the recognition of the confederacy and an armed intervention on our side would it not be glorious oh for peace blessed peace and our brothers once more palmerston is said to have painted butler as the vilest oppressor and having added he was ashamed to acknowledge him of anglo saxon origin perhaps knowing the opinion entertained of him by foreign nations caused butler to turn such a somersault for a few days before his arrival here we saw a leading article in the leading union paper of new orleans threatening us with the arming of the slaves for our extermination if england interfered in the same language almost as butler used when here three days ago the same paper ridiculed the idea and said such a brutal inhuman thing was never for a moment thought of it was too absurd and so the world goes we all turn somersaults occasionally and yet i would rather we would achieve our independence alone if possible it would be so much more glorious and then i would hate to see england conquer the north even if for our sake my love for the old union is still too great to be willing to see it so humiliated if england would just make lincoln come to his senses and put an end to all this confiscation which is sweeping over everything make him agree to let us alone and behave himself that will be quite enough but what a task if it were put to the vote to morrow to return free and unmolested to the union or stay out i am sure union would have the majority but this way to think we are to be sent to fort jackson and all the other prisons for expressing our ideas however harmless to have our houses burned over our heads and all the prominent men hanged who would be eager for it unless indeed it was to escape even the greater horrors of a war of extermination july 5th think that since the 28th of may i have not walked three squares at a time for my only walks are to mrs brunot's it is enough to kill any one i might as well be at ship island where butler has sentenced mrs phillips for laughing while the corpse of a federal officer 1 was passing at least that is to be the principal charge though i hope for the sake of butler's soul that he had better reasons shocking as her conduct was she hardly deserved two years close confinement in such a dreadful place as that because she happened to have no sense of delicacy and no feeling the darkest hour is just before the day we have had the blackest night for almost three months and i don't see the light yet better days are coming i am getting skeptical i fear me i look forward to my future life with a shudder this one cannot last long i will be up and doing before many months are past doing what why if all father left us is lost forever if we are to be penniless as well as homeless i'll work for my living how i wonder i will teach i know i am not capable but i can do my best i would rather die than be dependent i would rather die than teach there now you know how i feel teaching before dependence death before teaching my soul revolts from the drudgery i never see a governess that my heart does not ache for her i think of the nameless numberless insults and trials she is forced to submit to of the hopeless thankless task that is imposed on her to which she is expected to submit without a murmur of all her griefs and agony shut up in her heart and i cry heaven help a governess my heart bleeds for them and 1 o'clock p.m thus far had i reached when news came that our forces were attacking the town and had already driven the pickets in i am well now we all rushed to make preparations instantly i had just finished washing my hair before i commenced writing and had it all streaming around me but it did not take a minute to thrust it into a loose net then we each put on a fresh dress except myself as i preferred to have a linen cambric worn several times before to a clean one not quite so nice for that can do good service when washed the excitement is intense mother is securing a few of father's most valuable papers lilly running around after the children and waiting for charlie who cannot be found miriam after securing all things needful has gone downstairs to wait the issue and i dressed for instant flight with my running bag tied to my waist and knapsack bonnet veil etc on the bed occupy my last few moments at home in this profitable way nobody knows what it is a regiment has been marched out to meet our troops some say commanded by van dorn which i doubt the gunboats are preparing to second them we hear the garrison drum and see people running that is all we don't know what is coming i believe it will prove nothing after all but the gunboat is drawn up so as to command our street here the guns aimed up the street just below and if a house falls ours will be about the first well this time next year we will know all of which we are now ignorant that is one consolation the house will either be down or standing then 6 p.m we have once more subsided how foolish all this seems miriam and i laughed while preparing and laughed while unpacking it is the only way to take such things and we agree on that as on most other subjects they say the affair originated from half a dozen shots fired by some federal soldiers through idleness whereupon the pickets rushed in screaming van dorn was after them at the head of six thousand men i have my reasons for doubting the story it must have been something more than that to spread such a panic for they certainly had time to ascertain the truth of the attack before they beat the long roll and sent out their troops for if it had been van dorn he would have been on them before that whatever it was i am glad of the excitement for it gave me new life for several hours i was really sick before oh this life when will it end evermore and forevermore shall we live in this suspense i wish we were in the sandwich islands july 7th as we have no longer a minister mr gierlow having gone to europe and no papers i am in danger of forgetting the days of the week as well as those of the month but i am positive that yesterday was sunday because i heard the sunday school bells and friday i am sure was the fourth because i heard the national salute fired i must remember that to find my dates by well last night being sunday a son of captain hooper who died in the fort jackson fight having just come from new orleans stopped here on his way to jackson to tell us the news or rather to see charlie and told us afterwards he says a boat from mobile reached the city saturday evening and the captain told mr la noue that he brought an extra from the former place containing news of mcclellan's surrender with his entire army his being mortally wounded and the instant departure of a french and english man of war from hampton roads with the news that revived my spirits considerably all except mcclellan's being wounded i could dispense with that but if it were true and if peace would follow and the boys come home oh what bliss i would die of joy as rapidly as i am pining away with suspense now i am afraid about ten o'clock as we came up mother went to the window in the entry to tell the news to mrs day and while speaking saw a man creeping by under the window in the narrow little alley on the side of the house evidently listening for he had previously been standing in the shadow of a tree and left the street to be nearer when mother ran to give the alarm to charlie i looked down and there the man was looking up as i could dimly see for he crouched down in the shadow of the fence presently stooping still he ran fast towards the front of the house making quite a noise in the long tangled grass when he got near the pepper bush he drew himself up to his full height paused a moment as though listening and then walked quietly towards the front gate by that time charlie reached the front gallery above and called to him asking what he wanted without answering the man walked steadily out closed the gate deliberately then suddenly remembering drunkenness would be the best excuse gave a lurch towards the house walked off perfectly straight in the moonlight until seeing dr day fastening his gate he reeled again that man was not drunk drunken men cannot run crouching do not shut gates carefully after them would have no inclination to creep in a dim little alley merely to creep out again it may have been one of our detectives standing in the full moonlight which was very bright he certainly looked like a gentleman for he was dressed in a handsome suit of black he was no citizen form your own conclusions well after all he heard no treason let him play eavesdropper if he finds it consistent with his character as a gentleman the captain who brought the extra from mobile wished to have it reprinted but it was instantly seized by a federal officer who carried it to butler who monopolized it so that will never be heard of again we must wait for other means of information the young boy who told us reminds me very much of jimmy he is by no means so handsome but yet there is something that recalls him and his voice though more childish sounds like jimmy's too i had an opportunity of writing to lydia by him of which i gladly availed myself and have just finished a really tremendous epistle wednesday 9th july poor miriam poor sarah they are disgraced again last night we were all sitting on the balcony in the moonlight singing as usual with our guitar i have been so accustomed to hear father say in the evening come girls where is my concert and he took so much pleasure in listening that i could not think singing in the balcony was so very dreadful since he encouraged us in it but last night changed all my ideas we noticed federals both officers and soldiers pass singly or by twos or threes at different times but as we were not singing for their benefit and they were evidently attending to their own affairs there was no necessity of noticing them at all but about half past nine after we had sung two or three dozen others we commenced mary of argyle as the last word died away while the chords were still vibrating came a sound of clapping hands in short down went every string of the guitar charlie cried i told you so and ordered an immediate retreat miriam objected as undignified but renounced the guitar mother sprang to her feet and closed the front windows in an instant whereupon dignified or not we all evacuated the gallery and fell back into the house all this was done in a few minutes and as quietly as possible and while the gas was being turned off downstairs miriam and i flew upstairs i confess i was mortified to death very very much ashamed but we wanted to see the guilty party for from below they were invisible we stole out on the front balcony above and in front of the house that used to be gibbes's we beheld one of the culprits at the sight of the creature my mortification vanished in intense compassion for his he was standing under the tree half in the moonlight his hands in his pockets looking at the extinction of light below with the true state of affairs dawning on his astonished mind and looking by no means satisfied with himself such an abashed creature he looked just as though he had received a kick that conscious of deserving he dared not return while he yet gazed on the house in silent amazement and consternation hands still forlornly searching his pockets as though for a reason for our behavior from under the dark shadow of the tree another slowly picked himself up from the ground hope he was not knocked down by surprise and joined the first his hands sought his pockets too and if possible he looked more mortified than the other after looking for some time at the house satisfied that they had put an end to future singing from the gallery they walked slowly away turning back every now and then to be certain that it was a fact if ever i saw two mortified hangdog looking men they were these two as they took their way home was it not shocking but they could not have meant it merely to be insulting or they would have placed themselves in full view of us rather than out of sight under the trees perhaps they were thinking of their own homes instead of us july 10th a proclamation is out announcing that any one talking about the war or present state of affairs will be summarily dealt with now seems to me summarily is not exactly the word they mean but still it has an imposing effect what a sad state their affairs must be in if they can't bear comment an officer arrived day before yesterday bringing the surprising intelligence that mcclellan had captured richmond and fifty thousand prisoners that is the time they talked but when we received yesterday confirmation of his being finally defeated by our troops and the capture of his railroad train twelve miles in length they forbid further mention of the subject i wonder if they expect to be obeyed what a stretch of tyranny o free america you who uphold free people free speech free everything what a foul blot of despotism rests on a once spotless name a nation of brave men who wage war on women and lock them up in prisons for using their woman weapon the tongue a nation of free people who advocate despotism a nation of brothers who bind the weaker ones hand and foot and scourge them with military tyrants and other free brotherly institutions what a picture who would not be an american one consolation is that this proclamation and the extraordinary care they take to suppress all news except what they themselves manufacture proves me our cause is prospering more than they like us to know i do believe day is about to break if our troops are determined to burn our houses over our heads to spite the yankees i wish they would hurry and have it over at once ten regiments of infantry are stationed at camp moore and scott's cavalry was expected at greenwell yesterday both preparing for an attack on baton rouge if we must be beggars let it come at once i can't endure this suspense july 11th a letter from george this morning it was written on the 20th of june and he speaks of being on crutches in consequence of his horse having fallen with him and injured his knee perhaps then he was not in the first battle of the 25th but bah i know george too well to imagine he would keep quiet at such a moment if he could possibly stand i am sure he was there with the rest of the louisiana regiment the papers say the conduct of the first louisiana is beyond all praise of course george was there and jimmy is with him at richmond but whether in the army or navy or what rank if in the first he does not say he only says he is looking remarkably well gibbes he had heard from in a letter dated the 16th and up to then he was in perfect health his last letter here was dated 10th of march so we are thankful enough now i was so delighted to read the accounts of the gallant seventh in some paper we fortunately procured at jackson's address and presentation of the battery they had so bravely won i was beside myself with delight i was thinking that gibbes of course was the regiment had taken the battery with his single sword and i know not what besides strange to say i have not an idea of the names of the half dozen battles he was in in june but believe that one to be port republic june 12th sic brother writes that rumors of the capture of baton rouge by our troops have made him very uneasy about us and he wishes us to go down to new orleans if possible i wish we could the impression here is that an attack is inevitable and the city papers found it necessary to contradict the rumor of ruggles having occupied it already i wish mother would go i can see no difference there or here except that there we will be safe for a while at least i grow desperate when i read these northern papers reviling and abusing us reproaching us for being broken and dispersed taunting us with their victories sparing no humiliating name in speaking of us and laughing as to what we'll see when we vile rebels are driven out of virginia and the glorious union firmly established i can't bear these taunts i grow sick to read these vile insulting papers that seem written expressly to goad us into madness there must be many humane reasonable men in the north can they not teach their editors decency in this their hour of triumph july 13th sunday a profitable way to spend such a day being forced to dispense with church going i have occupied myself in reading a great deal and writing a little which latter duty is a favorite task of mine after church on sundays but this evening the mosquitoes are so savage that writing became impossible until miriam and i instituted a grand extermination process which we partly accomplished by extraordinary efforts she lay on the bed with the bar half drawn over her and half looped up while i was commissioned to fan the wretches from all corners into the pen it was rather fatiguing and in spite of the numbers slain hardly recompensed me for the trouble of hunting them around the room but still miriam says exercise is good for me and she ought to know i have been reading that old disguster boswell bah i have no patience with the toady i suppose my mind is not yet thoroughly impregnated with the johnsonian ether and that is the reason why i cannot appreciate him or his work i admire him for his patience and minuteness in compiling such trivial details he must have been an amiable man to bear johnson's brutal ill humored remarks but seems to me if i had not spirit enough to resent the indignity i would at least not publish it to the world briefly my opinion which this book has only tended to confirm is that boswell was a vain conceited prig a fool of a jackanape an insupportable sycophant a whatever mean thing you please there is no word small enough to suit him as to johnson he is a surly old bear in short an old brute of a tyrant all his knowledge and attainments could not have made me tolerate him i am sure i could have no respect for a man who was so coarse in speech and manners and who eat like an animal fact is i am not a boswellian or a johnsonian either i do not think him such an extraordinary man i have heard many conversations as worthy of being recorded as nineteen twentieths of his in spite of his learning he was narrow minded and bigoted which i despise above all earthly failings witness his tirades against americans calling us rascals robbers pirates and saying he would like to burn us now i have railed at many of these ordinary women here for using like epithets for the yankees and have felt the greatest contempt for their absurd abuse these poor women do not aspire to johnsonian wisdom and their ignorance may serve as an excuse for their narrow mindedness but the wondrous johnson to rave and bellow like any billingsgate nymph bah he is an old disguster july 14th 3 p.m another pleasant excitement news has just arrived that scott's cavalry was having a hard fight with the yankees eight miles from town everybody immediately commenced to pick up stray articles and get ready to fly in spite of the intense heat i am resigned as i hardly expect a shelling another report places the fight fourteen miles from here a man on horseback came in for reinforcements heaven help poor howell if it is true i am beginning to doubt half i hear people tell me the most extravagant things and if i am fool enough to believe them and repeat them i suddenly discover that it is not half so true as it might be and as they themselves frequently deny having told it all the odium of manufacturing rests on my shoulders which have not been accustomed to bear lies of any kind i mean to cease believing anything unless it rests on the word of some responsible person by the way the order i so confidently believed concerning the proclamation turns out not quite so bad i was told women were included and it extended to private houses as well as public ones though i fortunately omitted that when i recorded it when i read it it said all discussions concerning the war are prohibited in bar rooms public assemblies and street corners as women do not frequent such places and private houses are not mentioned i cannot imagine how my informant made the mistake unless like me it was through hearing it repeated odious as i thought it then i think it wise now for more than one man has lost his life through discussions of the kind july 17th thursday it is decided that i am to go to new orleans next week i hardly know which i dislike most going or staying i know i shall be dreadfully homesick but remember and keep quiet sarah i beg of you everything points to an early attack here some say this week the federals are cutting down all our beautiful woods near the penitentiary to throw up breastworks some say cannon are to be planted on the foundation of mr pike's new house everybody is in a state of expectation honestly if baton rouge has to be shelled i shall hate to miss the fun it will be worth seeing and i would like to be present even at the risk of losing my big toe by a shell but then by going i can save many of my clothes and then miriam and i can divide when everything is burned that is one advantage besides being beneficial by the change of air they say the town is to be attacked to night i don't believe a word of it oh i was so distressed this evening they tell me mr biddle was killed at vicksburg i hope it is not true suppose it was a shot from will's battery july 20th sunday last night the town was in a dreadful state of excitement before sunset a regiment that had been camped out of town came in and pitched their tents around the new theatre in front of our church all was commotion and bustle and as the pickets had been drawn in and the soldiers talked freely of expecting an attack everybody believed it and was consequently in rather an unpleasant state of anticipation their cannon were on the commons back of the church the artillery horses tied to the wheels while some dozen tents were placed around filled with men who were ready to harness them at the first alarm with all these preparations in full view we went to bed as usual i did not even take the trouble of gathering my things which i had removed from my peddler sack and slept satisfied that if forced to fly i would lose almost everything in spite of my precaution in making a bag well night passed and here is morning and nothing is heard yet the attack is delayed until this evening or to morrow they say woman though i am i am by no means as frightened as some of these men are i can't get excited about it perhaps it is because they know the danger and i do not but i hate to see men uneasy i have been so accustomed to brave fearless ones who would beard the devil himself that it gives me a great disgust to see any one less daring than father and the boys i have been so busy preparing to go to the city that i think if the frolic should intervene and prevent my departure i would be disappointed though i do not want to go it would be unpleasant for instance to pack all i own in my trunk and just as i place the key in my pocket to hear the shriek of van dorn raised again this time it is to be ruggles though i would not mind if he came before i was packed besides even if i miss the fun here they say the boats are fired into from plaquemine and then i have the pleasure of being in a fight anyhow mother is alarmed about that part of my voyage but miriam and i persuaded her it is nothing if i was a man oh would n't i be in richmond with the boys what is the use of all these worthless women in war times if they attack i shall don the breeches and join the assailants and fight though i think they would be hopeless fools to attempt to capture a town they could not hold for ten minutes under the gunboats how do breeches and coats feel i wonder i am actually afraid of them i kept a suit of jimmy's hanging in the armoir for six weeks waiting for the yankees to come thinking fright would give me courage to try it what a seeming paradox but i never succeeded lilly one day insisted on my trying it and i advanced so far as to lay it on the bed and then carried my bird out i was ashamed to let even my canary see me but when i took a second look my courage deserted me and there ended my first and last attempt at disguise i have heard so many girls boast of having worn men's clothes i wonder where they get the courage to think half the men in town sat up all night in expectation of a stampede while we poor women slept serenely everybody is digging pits to hide in when the ball opens the days have dug a tremendous one the wolffs sheppers and some fifty others have taken the same precaution they may as well dig their graves at once what if a tremendous shell should burst over them and bury in the dirt those who were not killed oh no let me see all the danger and the way it is coming at once to morrow or day after in case no unexpected little incident occurs in the interval i purpose going to new orleans taking father's papers and part of miriam's and mother's valuables for safe keeping i hate to go but they all think i should as it will be one less to look after if we are shelled which i doubt i don't know that i require much protection but i might as well be agreeable and go ouf how i will grow homesick before i am out of sight midnight here we go sure enough at precisely eleven o'clock while we were enjoying our first dreams we were startled by the long roll which was beat half a square below us at first i only repeated the roll of the drum without an idea connected with it but hearing the soldiers running in another instant i was up and was putting on my stockings when miriam ran in in her nightgown the children were roused and dressed quickly and it did not take us many instants to prepare the report of two shots and the tramp of soldiers cries of double quick and sound as of cannon moving rather hastening our movements armoirs bureaus and everything else were thrown open and miriam and i hastily packed our sacks with any articles that came to hand having previously taken the precaution to put on everything fresh from the armoir we have saved what we can but i find myself obliged to leave one of my new muslins i had just finished as it occupied more room than i can afford the body of my lovely lilac and my beauteous white mull but then i have saved eight half made linen chemises that will be better than the outward show here comes an alarm of fire at least a dreadful odor of burning cotton which has set everybody wild with fear that conflagration is to be added to these horrors the cavalry swept past on their way to the river ten minutes ago and here comes the news that the gunboats are drawing up their anchors and making ready well here an hour has passed suppose they do not come after all i have been watching two sentinels at the corner who are singing and dancing in the gayest way one reminds me of gibbes i have seen him dance that way often i was glad to see a good humored man again i wish i was in bed i am only sitting up to satisfy my conscience for i have long since ceased to expect a real bombardment if it must come let it be now i am tired of waiting a crowd of women have sought the protection of the gunboats i am distressed about the brunots suppose they did not hear the noise o girls if i was a man i wonder what would induce me to leave you four lone unprotected women sleeping in that house unconscious of all this is manhood a dream that is past is humanity an idle name fatherless brotherless girls if i was honored with the title of man i do believe i would be fool enough to run around and wake you at least not another word though i shall go mad with rage and disgust i am going to bed this must be a humbug morgan came running in once more in his nightgear begging lilly to hear his prayers in answer to her why you have said them to night he says yes but i've been getting up so often poor child no wonder he is perplexed one hour and a half of this nonsense and no result known we are told the firing commenced and the pickets were driven in twenty minutes before the long roll beat july 21st it is impossible to discover the true story of last night's alarm some say it was a gang of negroes who attacked the pickets in revenge for having been turned out of the garrison others say it was a number of our soldiers who fired from the bushes and the most amusing story is that they took alarm at an old white horse which they killed mistaking him for the confederates one regiment has refused to do picket duty and the story runs among these poor soldiers that our army which is within a mile is perfectly overwhelming the excitement still continues i have been writing to the brunots the news confirming the death of mcclellan the surrender of his army and the good tidings of our ram's recent exploits above vicksburg and her arriving safely under the guns there if we could keep all the dispatches that have passed between us since the battle of the forts what a collection of absurdity and contradiction it would be forts have been taken their ships have passed forts safe yankees at our mercy ships at new orleans city to be bombarded in twelve hours forts surrendered city under british protection no it is n't city surrendered mistake baton rouge to be burned when yankee ships come and soon sometimes three times a day each dispatch contradicting the other and all equally ridiculous the crowd here seems to increase the streets are thronged with the military and it will soon be impossible to go even to mrs brunot's which will be a great privation to me five thousand are to come next week and then it will really be impossible to go in the streets july 22d tuesday another such day and there is the end of me charlie decided to send lilly and the children into the country early to morrow morning and get them safely out of this doomed town mother miriam and i were to remain here alone take the children away and i can stand whatever is to come but this constant alarm with five babies in the house is too much for any of us so we gladly packed their trunks and got them ready and then news came pouring in first a negro man just from the country told lilly that our soldiers were swarming out there that he had never seen so many men then dena wrote us that a mrs bryan had received a letter from her son praying her not to be in baton rouge after wednesday morning as they were to attack to morrow then a man came to charlie and told him that though he was on parole yet as a mason he must beg him not to let his wife sleep in town to night to get her away before sunset but it is impossible for her to start before morning hearing so many rumors all pointing to the same time we began to believe there might be some danger so i packed all necessary clothing that could be dispensed with now in a large trunk for mother miriam and me and got it ready to send out in the country to mrs williams all told i have but eight dresses left so i'll have to be particular i am wealthy compared to what i would have been sunday night for then i had but two in my sack and now i have my best in the trunk if the attack comes before the trunk gets off or if the trunk is lost we will verily be beggars for i pack well and it contains everything of any value in clothing the excitement is on the increase i think everybody is crazy to leave town thursday july 24th yes that must be the date for one day and two nights have passed since i was writing here where shall i begin the story of my wanderings i don't know that it has a beginning it is all so hurried and confused but it was tuesday evening that the federals were seized with a panic which threw the whole town in alarm they said our troops were within eight miles ten thousand in number the report was even started that the advance guard was skirmishing with the federals the shots were heard distinctly a dozen people were ready to swear the yankees struck their tents galloped with their cannon through the streets with the most terrific din troops passed at double quick on their way to the garrison everything was confusion mr tunnard told us yesterday he was present when part of them reached the gate of the garrison and saw one of the officers spring forward waving his sword and heard him cry trot men gallop i say damn you run in with a perfect yell at the close whereupon all lookers on raised a shout of laughter for the man was frightened out of his wits a federal officer told him that their fright was really a disgrace and if one thousand of our men had come in town the whole thirty five hundred would have been at their mercy even the naval officers denounce it as a most arrant piece of cowardice for instead of marching their troops out to meet ours they all rushed into the garrison where if attacked their only retreat would have been into the river the gunboats were ordered into the middle of the stream in front of the garrison and cooped up there these valiant men awaited the assault in such trepidation that yesterday they freely said the force could be purchased for fifty cents they are so ashamed of their panic imagine what effect this had on the inhabitants soon an exodus took place in the direction of the asylum and we needs must follow the general example and run too in haste we packed a trunk with our remaining clothes what we could get in and the greatest confusion prevailed for an hour beatrice had commenced to cry early in the evening and redoubled her screams when she saw the preparations and louis joining in they cried in concert until eight o'clock when we finally got off what a din lilly looked perfectly exhausted that look on her face made me heartsick miriam flew around everywhere mother always had one more article to find and the noise was dreadful when white and black assembled in the hall ready at last charlie placed half of the trunks on the dray leaving the rest for another trip and we at last started off besides the inevitable running bag tied to my waist on this stifling night i had my sunbonnet veil comb toothbrush cabas filled with dozens of small articles and dagger to carry and then my heart failed me when i thought of my guitar so i caught it up in the case and remembering father's heavy inkstand i seized that too with two fans if i was asked what i did with all these things i could not answer certain it is i had every one in my hands and was not very ridiculous to behold seventeen in number counting white and black our procession started off each loaded in their own way the soldiers did not scruple to laugh at us those who were still waiting in front of the churches to be removed laughed heartily and cried hello where are you going running good bye fortunately they could not see our faces for it was very dark one stopped us under a lamp post and wanted us to go back he said he knew we were to be attacked for the confederates were within five miles but we were as safe at home as at the asylum he was a very handsome respectable looking man though dirty as yankee soldiers always are and in his shirt sleeves besides we thanked him for his kindness and went on all stopped at the brunots to see that they were ready to fly but the two parties were so tremendous that we gladly divided and miriam and i remained with them until they could get ready while our detachment went on wagons carts every vehicle imaginable passed on to places of safety loaded with valuables while women and children hurried on on foot it took the brunots as long to prepare as it did us i had to drag sophie out of her bed where she threw herself vowing she would not run and after an interminable length of time we were at last ready and started with the addition of mrs loucks and her sons in our train the volunteer whose sole duty seems to be to watch the brunots met us as we got out he stopped as he met the first looked in silence until sophie and i passed and then burst out laughing no wonder what a walk it was nobody hesitated to laugh even though they meant to run themselves and we made fun of each other too so our walk was merry enough when we reached there the asylum was already crowded at least it would have been a crowd in any other place though a mere handful in such a building the whole house was illuminated up to the fifth story and we were most graciously received by the director who had thrown the whole house open to whoever chose to come and exerted himself to be accommodating it looked like a tremendous hotel where every one is at home not a servant or one of the deaf and dumb children was to be seen we had all the lower story to ourselves was n't it pleasant to unload and deposit all things in a place of safety it was a great relief then we five girls walked on the splendid balcony which goes around the house until we could no longer walk when i amused myself by keeping poor sophie standing since she would not sit down like a christian but insisted on going to bed like a lazy girl as she is when i finally let her go it did not take her many minutes to undress and soon we were all ready for bed the brunots had beds on the parlor floor across the wide hall we had a room opposite and next to ours lilly and the children were all sleeping soundly i ran the blockade of the hall in my nightgown and had a splendid romp with the girls after rolling sophie out of bed and jerking nettie up mother and mrs brunot cried order laughing but they came in for their share of the sport until an admiring crowd of females at the door told us by their amused faces they were enjoying it too so i ran the gauntlet again and got safely through the hall and after a few more inroads in one of which miriam accompanied me and on which occasion i am sure we were seen in our nightgowns we finally went to bed i won't say went to sleep for i did not pretend to doze all our side of the house had bars except me and the mosquitoes were unendurable so i watched mother and miriam in their downy slumbers and lay on my hard bed for hours fighting the torments with bare arms every now and then i heard a stir among the females above indicating that some few were anticipating a panic once they took a rush from the fourth story and cried they heard the cannon twenty guns had been fired etc i lay still determined not to believe it and presently all subsided i lay there for hours longer it seemed when nettie at last wandered in disconsolate to find if we were asleep for with the exception of sophie they too had been awake all night i went to the parlor with her when she dena and i decided to dress at once and sit on the balcony since sleep was hopeless behold me in a blue muslin flounced to the waist with a cape too what a running costume miriam only had time to take off her white dress before starting all dressed we went to the northwest corner as far as possible from the rest of the household and sat in a splendid breeze for hours it was better than fighting insatiable mosquitoes so there we sat talking through the greater part of a night which seemed to have borrowed a few additional hours for our benefit we'll have no leap year in 64 the twenty four extra hours were crowded in on that occasion i think we discussed our favorite books characters authors repeated scraps here and there of the mock sentimental talked of how we would one day like to travel and where we would go discussed love and marriage and came to the conclusion neither was the jest it was thought to be o wise young women poor nettie retired in despair and we two watched alone for hours longer the sun must have been arrested by some joshua on the road could n't make me believe it was doing its duty as usual we wandered around the balconies through the grounds in the dim starlight for it was cloudy and finally beholding a faint promise of morning sat still and waited for the coming of the lazy sun what was still more aggravating was that every time we looked in at the others showed them sleeping peacefully miriam lay her full length with outstretched arms the picture of repose looking so comfortable when the sun finally made his appearance he was out on a spree i found for his eyes were not half opened and he looked dull and heavy as he peeped from behind his bed curtains others began to stir and in an hour more we were ready to leave those who had slept came out with swelled eyes and drowsy looks while we three who had been up all night were perfectly calm though rather pale but i am seldom otherwise were we not thankful to see home still standing i did not feel tired much but somehow when it struck half past six and i found myself alone here miriam having stopped at mrs day's i suddenly found myself divested of my flounces and most other articles and involuntarily going towards the bed i could not sleep was n't thinking of such a thing meant to there was an end of my soliloquy where i went i don't know as the clock struck eight i got up as unaccountably and discovered i had lost all idea of time in sleep if it had not been for the clock i should have said i had slept a day and a night and it was now thursday morning a giant refreshed i rose from my slumbers took a hasty cup of coffee and set to work packing lilly's trunk for i was crazy to see the children off as soon as possible it was no short work but we all hurried said good bye and saw them go with a feeling of relief by the experience of the night before we knew that when the real moment came it would be impossible to get them off in time to escape danger poor lilly we miss her sadly but are thankful to know that she is out of danger with her poor little children she looked heartbroken at the idea of leaving us alone but then when one weak woman has five small babies to take care of is it fair to impose three big ones on her i'd never stay here if she sacrificed her children to take care of us who need no protection i was very lazy after they left and sat reading until a note was brought from charlie saying they were safe beyond the lines last night came another alarm some fifty cannon were fired somewhere above reports came that a body of our troops were a few miles out so a thousand of these men took courage and went out to reconnoitre mrs brunot and mother insisted on going again to the asylum for protection against the coming attack though we at first begged and pleaded to stay at home but we had to follow and i don't think any of us were in the best of humors as we were all conscious of doing a foolish thing we were cordially received again and got quite gay sleeping accommodations no better than before as far as i was concerned sophie miriam and i had but one bar between us so we placed two mattresses side by side and by dint of chairs and strings stretched the net as far as possible over them those two were well enough but to my share fell a baby's mattress two feet by four placed between the wall and the other great bed with the end of the bar a foot above my face and one sheet to do the duty of two however they had only one also well i believe i am tall so my bed did not fit me as it was two inches higher than theirs there was no sharing in spite of a heavy rain that was now pouring my warm place was intolerable and the perspiration streamed from my face so as to be disagreeable to say the least it drove me to walk in my sleep i am afraid for i have an indistinct recollection of finding myself standing at the window trying to breathe it was a very very little piece of sleep i got after all and that little by no means refreshing up at sunrise again but it took some time to get ready for i had to get some clothes out of the trunk to send home well ever since i reached here i have been writing and i am ashamed to say how long it is as the time grows more exciting my book grows shorter to my great distress what will i do we all vowed that would be the last time we would run until we heard the cannon or had some better reason than a yankee panic to believe the confederates were coming though if we listened to mother she would go there every night if this lasted for a whole year kind phillie nolan wrote insisting on our staying with them on the plantation until it was over but we cannot do it the time is too uncertain if we knew it was to come this week we might stay that long with her but to go for an indefinite period miriam and i would not hear of i have kept for the last a piece of news i received with thankfulness when i finally heard it for though known to the whole family and all the town on tuesday night no one thought it worth while to tell me until i heard it by accident last evening it was that a mr bell writing to his wife says gibbes asked him to send word to mother that he george and jimmy were in the fight of the 10th and 11th and all safe god be praised july 25th an old gentleman stopped here just now in a carriage and asked to see me such a sad sick old man he said his name was caldwell and that passing through east feliciana mrs flynn had asked him to deliver a message to us had we heard from our brothers i told him the message from mr bell he commenced crying there was one of them he said who got hurt i held my breath and looked at him he cried more still and said yes it was gibbes in the hand not dangerous but here i thought he meant to tell me worse perhaps he was dead but i could not speak so he went on saying lydia and the general had gone on to richmond instantly and had probably reached there before today he took so long to tell it and he cried so that i was alarmed until i thought perhaps he had lost one of his own sons but i dared not ask him just then one of the horses fell down with sunstroke and i begged the old gentleman to come in and rest until they could raise the horse but he said no he must go on to the river he looked so sick that i could not help saying he looked too unwell to go beyond and i wished he would come in but he burst into tears saying yes my child i am very very sick but i must go on poor old man with his snowwhite beard july 27th i have my bird back as i waked this morning i heard a well known chirp in the streets and called to mother i knew it was jimmy sure enough it is my bird lucy daigre has had him ever since the shelling as a negro caught it that day and gave it to her july 29th this town with its ten thousand soldiers is more quiet than it was with the old population of seven thousand citizens with this tremendous addition it is like a graveyard in its quiet at times these poor soldiers are dying awfully thirteen went yesterday on sunday the boats discharged hundreds of sick at our landing some lay there all the afternoon in the hot sun waiting for the wagon to carry them to the hospital which task occupied the whole evening in the mean time these poor wretches lay uncovered on the ground in every stage of sickness cousin will saw one lying dead without a creature by to notice when he died another was dying and muttering to himself as he lay too far gone to brush the flies out of his eyes and mouth while no one was able to do it for him cousin will helped him though another a mere skeleton lay in the agonies of death too but he evidently had kind friends for several were gathered around holding him up and fanning him while his son leaned over him crying aloud tiche says it was dreadful to hear the poor boy's sobs all day our vis à vis baumstark with his several aids plies his hammer all day sunday he made coffins and says he can't make them fast enough think too he is by no means the only undertaker here oh i wish these poor men were safe in their own land it is heartbreaking to see them die here like dogs with no one to say godspeed the catholic priest went to see some sometime ago and going near one who lay in bed said some kind thing when the man burst into tears and cried thank god i have heard one kind word before i die in a few minutes the poor wretch was dead july 31st i believe i forgot to mention one little circumstance in my account of that first night at the deaf and dumb asylum which at the time struck me with extreme disgust that was seeing more than one man who had no females or babies to look after who sought there a refuge from the coming attack at daylight one dapper young man in fashionable array came stepping lightly on the gallery carrying a neat carpet bag in his hand i hardly think he expected to meet two young ladies at that hour i shall always believe he meant to creep away before any one was up for he certainly looked embarrassed when we looked up though he assumed an air of indifference and passed by bravely swinging his sack but i think he wanted us to believe he was not ashamed i dare say it was some little clerk in his holiday attire but i can't say what contempt i felt for the creature honestly i believe the women of the south are as brave as the men who are fighting and certainly braver than the home guard i have not yet been able to coax myself into being as alarmed as many i could name are they say it is because i do not know the danger soit i prefer being brave through ignorance to being afraid in consequence of my knowledge of coming events thank heaven my brothers are the bravest of the brave i would despise them if they shrunk back though lucifer should dispute the path with them well all men are not morgan boys they tell me cowards actually exist though i hope i never met one the poor men that went to the asylum for safety might not have what lavinia calls a moral backbone no wonder then they tumbled in there besides i am told half the town spent the night on the banks of the river on that occasion and perhaps these unfortunates were subject to colds and preferred the shelter of a good roof poor little fellows how i longed to give them my hoops corsets and pretty blue organdie in exchange for their boots and breeches only i thought it was dangerous for suppose the boots had been so used to running that they should prance off with me too why it would ruin my reputation miss morgan in petticoats is thought to be as brave as any other man but these borrowed articles might make her fly as fast as any other man too if panic is contagious as the yankees here have proved one consolation is that all who could go with any propriety and all who were worthy of fighting among those who believed in the south are off at the seat of war it is only trash and those who are obliged to remain for private reasons who still remain let us count those young individuals as trash and step over them only ask heaven why you were made with a man's heart and a female form and those creatures with beards were made as bewitchingly nervous
wednesday july 15th it is but too true both have fallen all port hudson privates have been paroled and the officers sent here for exchange aye aye i know some privates i would rather see than the officers as yet only ten that we know have arrived all are confined in the custom house last evening crowds surrounded the place we did something dreadful ada peirce miriam and i we went down to the confectionery and unable to resist the temptation made a détour by the custom house in hope of seeing one of our poor dear half starved mule and rat fed defenders the crowd had passed away then but what was our horror when we emerged from the river side of the building and turned into canal to find the whole front of the pavement lined with yankees our folly struck us so forcibly that we were almost paralyzed with fear however that did not prevent us from endeavoring to hurry past though i felt as though walking in a nightmare ada was brave enough to look up at a window where several of our prisoners were standing and kept urging us to do likewise look he knows you sarah he has called another to see you they both recognize you oh look please and tell me who they are they are watching you still she would exclaim but if my own dear brother stood there i could not have raised my eyes we only hurried on faster with a hundred yankees eyes foxed on our flying steps my friend colonel steadman was one of the commissioners for arranging the terms of the capitulation i see he has not yet arrived dreadful news has come of the defeat of lee at gettysburg think i believe it all he may have been defeated but no one of these reports of total overthrow and rout do i credit yankees jubilant southerners dismal brother with principles on one side and brothers on the other is correspondingly distracted saturday july 18th it may be wrong i feel very contrite but still i cannot help thinking it is an error on the right side it began by miriam sending mr conn a box of cigars when she was on canal the other day with a note saying we would be delighted to assist him in any way poor creature he wrote an answer which breathed desolation and humility under his present situation in every line the cigars an unexpected kindness had touched a tender cord evidently he said he had no friends and would be grateful for our assistance but before his answer arrived yesterday morning i took it into my head that colonel steadman was also at the custom house though his arrival had not been announced the yankees declining to publish any more names to avoid the excitement that follows so miriam and i prepared a lunch of chicken soup wine preserves sardines and cakes to send to him and fool like i sent a note with it it only contained the same offer of assistance and i would not object to the town crier's reading it but it upset brother's ideas of decorum completely he said nothing to miriam's because that was first offense but yesterday he met edmond who was carrying the basket and he could not stand the sight of another note i wish he had read it but he said he would not assume such a right so he came home very much annoyed and spoke to miriam about it fortunately for my peace of mind i was swimming in the bathtub in blissful unconsciousness else i should have drowned myself he said i want you both to understand that you shall have everything you want for the prisoners subscribe any sum of money purchase any quantity of clothing send all the food you please but for god's sake don't write to them in such a place every man knows the other has received a letter and none know what it contains i cannot have my sisters names in everybody's mouth never do it again all as kind and as considerate for us as ever and a necessary caution i love him the better for it but i was dismayed for having rendered the reproof necessary for three hours i made the most hideous faces at myself and groaned aloud over brother's displeasure he is so good that i would rather bite my tongue off than give him a moment's pain just now i went to him unable to keep silence any longer and told him how distressed i was to have displeased him about that note don't think any more about it only don't do it again dear was his answer i was so grateful to him for his gentleness that i was almost hurried into a story i began it is the first time when i caught myself and said boldly no it is not colonel steadman has written to me before and i have replied but i promise to you it shall not occur again if i can avoid it he was satisfied with the acknowledgment and i was more than gratified with his kindness yet the error must have been on the right side colonel steadman wrote back his thanks by edmond with heartfelt gratitude for finding such friends in his adversity and touching acknowledgments of the acceptable nature of the lunch his brother and colonel lock were wounded though recovering and he was anxious to know if i had yet recovered and that was all except that he hoped we would come to see him and his thanks to brother for his kind message brother had sent him word by one of the prisoners that though he was not acquainted with him yet as his sisters friend he would be happy to assist him if he needed money or clothing there was no harm in either note and though i would not do it again i am almost glad i let him know he still had friends before brother asked me not to write and as yet we can't see them a man was bayoneted yesterday for waving to them even it only makes us the more eager to see them we did see some walking on rampart street with the peirces yesterday in front of a splendid private house we saw sentinels stationed upon inquiry we learned that general gardiner and a dozen others were confined there ada and miriam went wild if it had not been for dignified marie and that model of propriety sarah there is no knowing but what they would have carried the house by storm we got them by without seeing a gray coat when they vowed to pass back declaring that the street was not respectable on the block above we had to follow so there they all stood on the balcony above we thought we recognized general gardiner major wilson major spratley and mr dupré miriam was sure she did but even when i put on a bold face and tried to look something kept me from seeing so i had all the appearance of staring without deriving the slightest benefit from it wonder what makes me such a fool mr conn writes that captain bradford is wounded but does not say whether he is here thursday july 23d it is bad policy to keep us from seeing the prisoners it just sets us wild about them put a creature you don't care for in the least in a situation that commands sympathy and nine out of ten girls will fall desperately in love here are brave self sacrificing noble men who have fought heroically for us and have been forced to surrender by unpropitious fate confined in a city peopled by their friends and kindred and as totally isolated from them as though they inhabited the dry tortugas ladies are naturally hero worshipers we are dying to show these unfortunates that we are as proud of their bravery as though it had led to victory instead of defeat banks wills that they remain in privacy consequently our vivid imaginations are constantly occupied in depicting their sufferings privations heroism and manifold virtues until they have almost become as demigods to us even horrid little captain c has a share of my sympathy in his misfortune fancy what must be my feelings where those i consider as gentlemen are concerned it is all i can do to avoid a most tender compassion for a very few select ones miriam and i are looked on with envy by other young ladies because some twenty or thirty of our acquaintance have already arrived to know a port hudson defender is considered as the greatest distinction one need desire if they would only let us see the prisoners once to sympathize with and offer to assist them we would never care to call on them again until they are liberated but this is aggravating of what benefit is it to send them lunch after lunch when they seldom receive it colonel steadman and six others i am sure did not receive theirs on sunday we sent with the baskets a number of cravats and some handkerchiefs i had embroidered for the colonel brother should forbid those gentlemen writing too already a dozen notes have been received from them and what can we do we can't tell them not to miriam received a letter from major spratley this morning raving about the kindness of the ladies of new orleans full of hope of future successes and vows to help deliver the noble ladies from the hands of their oppressors etc it is a wonder that such a patriotic effusion could be smuggled out he kindly assures us that not only those of our acquaintance there but all their brother officers would be more than happy to see us in their prison position of affairs rather reversed since we last met
august 2d saturday i had thought my running days were over so little did i anticipate another stampede that i did not notice the report of the attack that was prophesied for night before last and went to bed without gathering my clothes but to day comes a hasty note from charlie telling us to leave instantly as general breckinridge is advancing with ten thousand men to attack us and at 12 m yesterday was within thirty four miles he begged us to leave to day there would be trouble before to morrow night it was so earnest and he asserted all so positively that we are going to phillie's this evening to stay a week as they say eight days will decide ah me our beautiful town still i am skeptical if it must be pray heaven that the blow comes now nothing can be equal to suspense these poor men are they not dying fast enough will baumstark have orders for an unlimited supply of coffins next week only charlie's family ours and the brunots know it he enjoined the strictest secrecy though the brunots sent to swear mrs loucks in as she like ourselves has no protector i would like to tell everybody but it will warn the federals i almost wish we too had been left in ignorance it is cruel to keep it to ourselves i believe the yankees expect something they say they have armed fifteen hundred negroes foes and insurrection in town assailing friends outside nice time our cavalry has passed the amite poor charlie has come all the way to the ferry landing on the other side to warn us if we do not take advantage it will not be for want of knowing what is to come how considerate it was in him to come such a long way i am charmingly excited if i only had a pair of breeches my happiness would be complete let it come i lose all but in heaven's name let us have it over at once my heart fails when i look around but spit fire and have an end to this at once liberty forever though death be the penalty treason here lies my pass at my elbow in which has been gratuitously inserted that parties holding it are considered to give their parole not to give information countenance aid or support to the so called confed s as i did not apply for it agree to the stipulation or think it by any means proper i don't consider it binding i could not give my word for doing what my conscience tells me is right i cross with this book full of treason it countenances the c s shall i burn it that is a stupid ruse they are too wise to ask you to subscribe to it they just append it august 3d westover enfin nous sommes arrivées and after what a trip as we reached the ferry i discovered i had lost he pass and had to walk back and search for it aided by mr tunnard who met me in my distress as it has always been his luck to do but somebody had already adopted the valuable trifle so i had to rejoin mother and miriam without it the guard resolutely refused to let us pass until we got another so off flew mr tunnard to procure a second which was vastly agreeable as i knew he would have to pay twenty five cents for it yankees having come down as low as that to procure money but he had gone before we could say anything and soon returned with the two bits worth of leave of absence then we crossed the river in a little skiff after sundown in a most unpleasant state of uncertainty as to whether the carriage was waiting at the landing for us for i did not know if phillie had received my note and there was no place to go if she had not sent for us however we found it waiting and leaving mother and miriam to pay the ferry i walked on to put our bundles in the carriage a man stepped forward calling me by name and giving me a note from charlie before i reached it and as i placed my foot on the step another came up and told me he had left a letter at home for me at one o'clock i bowed yes it was from howell must answer to morrow he asked me not to mention it was him a little servant had asked his name but he told her it was none of her business i laughed at the refined remark and said i had not known who it was he would hardly have been flattered to hear i had not even inquired he modestly said that he was afraid i had seen him through the window oh no i assured him well please anyhow don't say it's me he pleaded most grammatically i answered smiling i did not know who it was then i know no more now and if you choose i shall always remain in ignorance of your identity he burst out laughing and went off with oh do miss morgan forget all about me as though it was a difficult matter who can he be we had a delightful drive in the moonlight though it was rather long and it was quite late when we drove up to the house and were most cordially welcomed by the family we sat up late on the balcony listening for the report of cannon which however did not come baton rouge is to be attacked to morrow they say pray heaven it will all be over by that time nobody seems to doubt it over here a while ago a long procession of guerrillas passed a short distance from the house looking for a party of yankees they heard of in the neighborhood and waved their hats for lack of handkerchiefs to us as we stood on the balcony i call this writing under difficulties here i am employing my knee as a desk a position that is not very natural to me and by no means comfortable i feel so stupid from want of sleep last night that no wonder i am not even respectably bright i think i shall lay aside this diary with my pen i have procured a nicer one so i no longer regret its close what a stupid thing it is as i look back how faintly have i expressed things that produced the greatest impression on me at the time and how completely have i omitted the very things i should have recorded bah it is all the same trash and here is an end of it for this volume whose stupidity can only be equaled by the one that precedes and the one that is to follow it but who expects to be interesting in war times if i kept a diary of events it would be one tissue of lies think there was no battle on the 10th or 11th mcclellan is not dead and gibbes was never wounded after that who believes in reliable information not i monday august 4th 1862 here we are at dr nolan's plantation with baton rouge lying just seven miles from us to the east we can surely hear the cannon from here they are all so kind to us that i ought to be contented but still i wish i was once more at home i suppose it is very unreasonable in me but i cannot help it i miss my old desk very much it is so awkward to write on my knee that i cannot get used to it mine is a nice little room upstairs detached from all the rest for it is formed by a large dormer window looking to the north from which i have seen a large number of guerrillas passing and repassing in their rough costumes constantly i enjoy the fresh air and all that but pleasant as it is i wish i was at home and all the fuss was over virginia nolan and miriam are already equipped in their riding costumes so i must lay this down and get ready to join them in a scamper across the fields how delighted i will be to get on a horse again august 5th about half past nine as we got up from the breakfast table a guerrilla told us the ram arkansas was lying a few miles below on her way to coöperate with breckinridge whose advance guard had already driven the pickets into baton rouge then we all grew wild with excitement such exclamations such delight that the dreadful moment had at last arrived and yet you could see each stop as we rejoiced to offer up a prayer for the preservation of those who were risking their lives at that moment reason and all else was thrown aside and we determined to participate in the danger if there was any to be incurred mother threatened us with shot and shell and bloody murder but the loud report of half a dozen cannon in slow succession only made us more determined to see the fun so lilly nolan and miss walters got on horseback and phillie ginnie miriam and i started off in the broiling sun leaving word for the carriage to overtake us when we once got in the driver being as crazy as we fairly made his horses run along the road to catch a glimpse of our ram when miles below she came in sight we could no longer remain in the carriage but mounted the levee and ran along on foot until we reached her when we crossed to the outer levee and there she lay at our feet and nothing in her after all there lay a heavy clumsy rusty ugly flatboat with a great square box in the centre while great cannon put their noses out at the sides and in front the decks were crowded with men rough and dirty jabbering and hastily eating their breakfast that was the great arkansas god bless and protect her and the brave men she carries while there a young man came up and in answer to phillie's inquiries about her father who having gone to town yesterday to report being paroled had written last night to say no passes were granted to leave town the young fellow informed her so pleasantly that her father was a prisoner held as hostage for mr castle poor phillie had to cry so to be still more agreeable he told her yes he had been sent to a boat lying at the landing and ran the greatest risk as the ram would probably sink the said boat in a few hours how i hated the fool for his relish of evil tidings but never mind our wild expedition or what came of it am i not patient ever since i commenced to write the sound of a furious bombardment has been ringing in my ears and beyond an occasional run to see the shells fly through the air their white smoke rather i have not said a word of it the girls have all crowded on the little balcony up here towards town and their shrieks of there it goes listen look at them rise above the sound of the cannon and occasionally draw me out too but i sit here listening and wonder which report precedes the knocking down of our home which shell is killing some one i know and love poor tiche and dophy where are they and oh i hope they did not leave my birdie jimmy to die in his cage i charged them to let him loose if they could not carry him dophy will be so frightened i hope they are out of danger oh my dear home shall i ever see you again and the brunots oh how i hope they are safe these loud cannon make me heartsick and yet i am so excited how rapidly they answer each other i am told the attack commenced at five this morning and lasted three hours those girls are shouting that baton rouge must be on fire from the volume of smoke in that direction how they scream as the balls go up to show it to each other i think i'll take a look too we are all going four or five miles through this warm sun to be nearer the scene of action any one might know there was no white man on the premises there is the carriage oh i am so seasick what will i be before we get back august 6th we six madcaps got in the carriage and buggy and rode off in search of news we took a quantity of old linen rags along and during the whole drive our fingers were busy making lint once we stopped at a neighbor's to gather the news but that did not interfere with our labors at all four miles from here we met a crowd of women flying and among them recognized mrs la noue and noémie a good deal of loud shouting brought them to the carriage in great surprise to see us there they were running from the plantation where they had taken refuge as it was not safe from the shells as the gunboats had proved to them the reports we had heard in the morning were from shots fired on this side of the river by them in hopes of hurting a guerrilla or two noémie told us that two western regiments had laid down their arms and general williams had been killed by his own men she looked so delighted and yet it made me sick to think of his having been butchered so phillie leaned out and asked her as she asked everybody if she knew anything about her father noémie in her rapture over that poor man's death exclaimed don't know a word about him know williams was cut to pieces though and that is all we could learn from her we went on until we came in sight of baton rouge there it stood looking so beautiful against the black lowering sky that i could not but regret its fate we could see the garrison state house asylum and all that but the object of the greatest interest to me was the steeple of the methodist church for to the right of it lay home while looking at it a negro passed who was riding up and down the coast collecting lint so i gave him all we had made and commenced some more presently we met mr phillips to whom phillie put the same question he is on the laurel hill a prisoner confound that negro where did he go and so on each answer as far as concerned her seeming a labor but the part relating to the servant very hearty poor phillie complained that everybody was selfish thought only of their own affairs and did not sympathize with her yes my dear i silently assented for it was very true every one seemed to think of their own interests alone it was late before we got home and then we had great fun in watching shells which we could dimly trace against the clouds falling in what must have been the garrison then came a tremendous fire above which may have been a boat i don't know i hear a tremendous firing again and from the two volumes of smoke should judge it was the arkansas and the essex trying their strength at a distance we are going down to see what's the fun it would be absurd to record all the rumors that have reached us since we can rely on none they say we fought up to nine last night and occupied the garrison for five minutes when the shells forced us to abandon it also that four regiments laid down their arms that the federals were pursued by our men to the river driven to the gunboats and pushed off to prevent the western men from coming aboard an eye witness from this side reports that general williams they say was forcibly held before a cannon and blown to pieces for the sake of humanity i hope this is false oh what a sad day this is for our country mother disapproved so of our going to the levee to see the fight that we consented to remain though miriam and ginnie jumped into the buggy and went off alone presently came tidings that all the planters near baton rouge were removing their families and negroes and that the yankees were to shell the whole coast from there up to here then phillie lilly nolan and i jumped in the carriage that was still waiting and ran after the others to bring them back before they got in danger but when we reached the end of the long lane we saw them standing on the high levee wringing their hands and crying we sprang out and joined them and there way at the bend lay the arkansas on fire all except myself burst into tears and lamentations and prayed aloud between their sobs i had no words or tears i could only look at our sole hope burning going and pray silently oh it was so sad think it was our sole dependence and we five girls looked at her as the smoke rolled over her watched the flames burst from her decks and the shells as they exploded one by one beneath the water coming up in jets of steam and we watched until down the road we saw crowds of men toiling along toward us then we knew they were those who had escaped and the girls sent up a shriek of pity on they came dirty half dressed some with only their guns others a few with bundles and knapsacks on their backs grimy and tired but still laughing we called to the first and asked if the boat were really afire they shouted yes and went on talking still presently one ran up and told us the story how yesterday their engine had broken and how they had labored all day to repair it how they had succeeded and had sat by their guns all night and this morning as they started to meet the essex the other engine had broken how each officer wrote his opinion that it was impossible to fight her with any hope of success under such circumstances and advised the captain to abandon her how they had resolved to do so had exchanged shots with the essex across the point and the first of the latter only one also had set ours afire when the men were ordered to take their side arms they thought it was to board the essex assembled together when the order was given to fire the arkansas and go ashore which was done in a few minutes several of the crew were around us then and up and down the road they were scattered still in crowds miriam must have asked the name of some of the officers for just then she called to me he says that is mr read i looked at the foot of the levee and saw two walking together i hardly recognized the gentleman i was introduced to on the mcrae in the one that now stood below me in rough sailor pants a pair of boots and a very thin and slazy lisle undershirt that is all he had on except an old straw hat and yes he held a primer i did not think it would be embarrassing to him to meet me under such circumstances i only thought of jimmy's friend as escaping from a sad fate so i rushed down a levee twenty feet high saying o mr read you won't recognize me but i am jimmy's sister he blushed modestly shook my hand as though we were old friends and assured me he remembered me was glad to meet me etc then miriam came down and talked to him and then we went to the top of the levee where the rest were and watched the poor arkansas burn by that time the crowd that had gone up the road came back and we found ourselves in the centre of two hundred men just we five girls talking with the officers around us as though they were old friends you could only guess they were officers for a dirtier more forlorn set i never saw not dirty either they looked clean considering the work they had been doing nobody introduced anybody else we all felt like brothers and sisters in our common calamity there was one handsome kentuckian whose name i soon found to be talbot who looked charmingly picturesque in his coarse cottonade pants white shirt straw hat black hair beard and eyes with rosy cheeks he was a graduate of the naval academy some years ago then another jolly faced young man from the same academy pleased me too he the doctor and the captain were the only ones who possessed a coat in the whole crowd the few who saved theirs carrying them over their arms mr read more than once blushingly remarked that they were prepared to fight and hardly expected to meet us but we pretended to think there was nothing unusual in his dress i can understand though that he should feel rather awkward i would not like to meet him if i was in the same costume they all talked over their loss cheerfully as far as the loss of money watches clothes were concerned but they were disheartened about their boat one threw himself down near my feet saying me voilà i have saved my gun et puis the clothes that i stand in and laughed as though it were an excellent joke one who had been on the merrimac chiefly regretted the loss of the commission appointing him there though he had not saved a single article the one with the jolly face told me will pinckney was among those attacking baton rouge and assured him he expected to take supper there last night he thought it would be with us i know i hope he is safe after a while the men were ordered to march up the lane to some resting spot it is best not to mention here and straggled off but there were many sick among them one wounded at vicksburg and we instantly voted to walk the mile and three quarters home and give them the carriage and buggy but long after they left we stood with our new friends on the levee watching the last of the arkansas and saw the essex and two gunboats crowded with men cautiously turn the point and watch her burn what made me furious was the thought of the glowing accounts they would give of their capture of the arkansas capture and they fired a shot apiece for all the firing we heard was the discharge of her guns by the flames we saw them go back as cautiously and i was furious knowing the accounts they would publish of what we ourselves had destroyed we had seen many shells explode and one magazine and would have waited for the other if the clouds had not threatened rain speedily but we had to leave her a mere wreck still burning and started off on our long walk in our hurry i had brought neither handkerchief nor gloves but hardly missed either i was so excited mr talbot walked home with me and each of the others with some one else he had a small bundle and a sword and the latter i insisted on carrying it was something to shoulder a sword made for use rather than for ornament so i would carry it he said he would remember who had carried it and the recollection would give it a new value in his eyes and i might rest assured it should never be disgraced after that and all that sort of thing of course as it is usual to say it on such occasions but i shouldered the sword bravely determined to show my appreciation of the sacrifice they had made for us in coming to our rescue on a boat they had every reason to believe was unsafe i liked mr talbot he made himself very agreeable in that long walk he asked permission to send me a trophy from the first action in which he used that sword and did n't i say yes he thought southern men had every encouragement in the world from the fact that the ladies welcomed them with great kindness in victory or defeat insinuating he thought they hardly deserved our compassion after their failure on the arkansas but i stoutly denied that it was a failure had they not done their best was it their fault the machinery broke and in defeat or victory were they not still fighting for us were we the less grateful when they met with reverse oh did n't i laud the southern men with my whole heart and i think he felt better for it too yes i like him we all met at the steps and water was given to our cavaliers who certainly enjoyed it we could not ask them in as dr nolan is on his parole but phillie intimated that if they chose to order they might do as they pleased as women could not resist armed men so they took possession of the sugar house and helped themselves to something to eat and were welcome to do it since no one could prevent but they first stood talking on the balcony gayly and we parted with many warm wishes on both sides insisting that if they assisted at a second attack on baton rouge they must remember our house was at their service wounded or in health and they all shook hands with us and looked pleased and said god bless you and good bye evening i heard a while ago the doctor of the ram who brought back the buggy say the arkansas's crew were about leaving so remembering poor mr read had lost everything mother suggesting he might need money gave me twenty dollars to put in his hands as some slight help towards reaching his destination besides coming from jimmy's mother he could not have been hurt but when i got down he was far up the lane walking too fast for me to overtake him then i tried to catch mr stephenson to give it to him for me but failed presently we saw i am afraid to say how many wagons loaded with them coming from the sugar house so phillie lilly and i snatched up some five bottles of gin between us and ran out to give it to them a rough old sailor received mine with a flood of thanks and the others gave theirs to those behind an officer rode up saying ladies there is no help for it the yankee cavalry are after us and we must fight them in the corn take care of yourselves we shouted yes told them to bring in the wounded and we would nurse them then the men cried god bless you and we cried hurrah for the arkansas's crew and fight for us altogether it was a most affecting scene phillie seeing how poorly armed they were suggested a gun which i flew after and delivered to a rough old tar when i got out the cart then passing held mr talbot who smiled benignly and waved his hat like the rest he looked still better in his black coat but the carts reminded me of what the guillotine days must have been in france he shouted good bye we shouted come to us if you are wounded he smiled and bowed and i cried use that sword whereupon he sprang to his feet and grasped the hilt as though about to commence then came other officers mr scales mr barblaud etc who smiled recognition stopped the wagon as phillie handed up a plate of bread and meat and talked gayly as they divided it until the captain rode up on gentlemen not a moment to lose then the cart started off the empty plate was flung overboard and they rode off waving hats and crying god bless you ladies in answer to our repeated offers of taking care of them if they were hurt and they have gone to meet the yankees and i hope they won't for they have worked enough today and from my heart i pray god prosper those brave men august 7th last night shortly after we got in bed we were roused by loud cannonading towards baton rouge and running out on the small balcony up here saw the light of a great fire in that direction from the constant reports and the explosion of what seemed to be several powder magazines we imagined it to be either the garrison or a gunboat whatever it was it was certainly a great fire we all ran out in our nightgowns and watched for an hour in the damp air i without even shoes we listened to the fight a long while until the sound ceased and we went back to bed evening i am so disheartened i have been listening with the others to a man who was telling us about baton rouge until i am heartsick he says the yankees have been largely reinforced and are prepared for another attack which will probably take place to morrow that the fight was a dreadful one we driving them in and losing twelve hundred to their fifteen hundred it must have been awful and that our troops have resolved to burn the town down since they cannot hold it under the fire of the gunboats august 8th friday again last night about nine we heard cannon in baton rouge and watched the flashes which preceded the reports by a minute at least for a long time we must have seen our own firing perhaps we wanted to find out the batteries of the enemy it was not the most delightful thing imaginable to watch what might be the downfall of our only home and then to think each ball might bring death to some one we love ah no it was not pleasant miriam and i have many friends in breckinridge's division i expect if we could only hear the names of the regiments the fourth is certainly there and poor will i wonder if he has had his supper yet i have been thinking of him ever since mr scales told me he was there and praying myself sick for his safety and that of the rest i shut my eyes at every report and say oh please poor will and the others too and when i don't hear the cannon i pray to be in advance of the next it is now midday and again we hear firing but have yet to learn the true story of the first day's fight preserve me from the country in such stirring days we might as well be in europe as to have the mississippi between us and town by unanimous consent the little lane in front of the house has been christened guerrilla lane and the long one leading to the river arkansas what an episode that was in our lives the officers go by the name of miriam's ginnie's sarah's as though they belonged to each those girls did me the meanest thing imaginable mr talbot and i were planning a grand combined attack on baton rouge in which he was to command a fleet and attack the town by the river while i promised to get up a battalion of girls and attack them in the rear we had settled it all except the time when just then all the others stopped talking i went on and now it is only necessary for you to name the day here the girls commenced to giggle and the young men tried to suppress a smile i felt annoyed but it did not strike me until after they had left that i had said anything absurd what evil imaginations they must have if they could have fancied i meant anything except the battle august 9th to our great surprise charlie came in this morning from the other side he was in the battle and general carter and dozens of others that we did not think of see the mountain reduced to a mole hill he says though the fight was desperate we lost only eighty five killed and less than a hundred and fifty wounded and we had only twenty five hundred against the yankees four thousand five hundred there is no truth in our having held the garrison even for a moment though we drove them down to the river in a panic the majority ran like fine fellows but a maine regiment fought like devils he says will and thompson bird set fire to the yankee camp with the greatest alacrity as though it were rare fun general williams was killed as he passed piper's by a shot from a window supposed to have been fired by a citizen some one from town told him that the federals were breaking in the houses destroying the furniture and tearing the clothes of the women and children in shreds like maniacs o my home i wonder if they have entered ours what a jolly time they would have over all the letters i left in my desk butler has ordered them to burn baton rouge if forced to evacuate it looks as though he was not so sure of holding it miss turner told miriam that her mother attempted to enter town after the fight to save some things when the gallant colonel dudley put a pistol to her head called her an old she devil and told her he would blow her d brains out if she moved a step that anyhow none but we d women had put the men up to fighting and we were the ones who were to blame for the fuss there is no name he did not call us august 10th sunday is this really sunday never felt less pious or less seriously disposed listen to my story and though i will of course fall far short of the actual terror that reigned yet it will show it in a lukewarm light that can at least recall the excitement to me to begin then last evening about six o'clock as we sat reading sewing and making lint in the parlor we heard a tremendous shell whizzing past which those who watched said passed not five feet above the house of course there was a slight stir among the unsophisticated though we who had passed through bombardments sieges and alarms of all kinds coolly remarked a shell and kept quiet the latter class was not very numerous it was from one of the three yankee boats that lay in the river close by the essex and two gunboats which were sweeping teams provisions and negroes from all the plantations they stopped at from baton rouge up the negroes it is stated are to be armed against us as in town where all those who manned the cannon on tuesday were for the most part killed and served them right another shell was fired at a carriage containing mrs durald and several children under pretense of discovering if she was a guerrilla doubtless fortunately she was not hurt however by the time the little émeute had subsided determined to have a frolic miss walters ginnie and i got on our horses and rode off down the arkansas lane to have a gallop and a peep at the gunboats from the levee but mother's entreaties prevented us from going that near as she cried that it was well known they fired at every horse or vehicle they saw in the road seeing a thousand guerrillas in every puff of dust and we were sure to be killed murdered and all sorts of bloody deaths awaited us so to satisfy her we took the road about a mile from the river in full view however we had not gone very far before we met a mr watson a plain farmer of the neighborhood who begged us to go back you'll be fired on ladies sure you don't know the danger take my advice and go home as quick as possible before they shell you they shot buggies and carriages and of course they won't mind horses with women please go home but ginnie who had taken a fancy to go on acted as spokeswoman and determined to go on in spite of his advice so nothing loath to follow her example we thanked him and rode on another met us looked doubtful said it was not so dangerous if the yankees did not see the dust but if they did we would be pretty apt to see a shell soon after here was frolic so we rode on some mile or two beyond but failing to see anything startling turned back again about two miles from here we met mr watson coming at full speed the ladies he said had sent him after us in all haste there was a report that the whole coast was to be shelled a lady had passed flying with her children the carriage was ordered out they were only waiting for us to run too we did not believe a word of it and were indignant at their credulity as well as determined to persuade them to remain where they were if possible when told their plan was to run to the house formerly used as a guerrilla camp we laughed heartily suppose the yankees fired a shell into it to discover its inhabitants the idea of choosing a spot so well known and what fun in running to a miserable hole when we might sleep comfortably here i am afraid rebellion was in the air indeed an impudent little negro who threw open the gate for us interrupted ginnie in the midst of a tirade with a sly here's the beginning of a little fuss we found them all crazy with fear i did not say much i was too provoked to trust myself to argue with so many frightened women i only said i saw no necessity ginnie resisted but finally succumbed mr watson whom we had enlisted on our side also said it was by no means necessary but if we were determined we might go to his house about four miles away and stay there it was very small but we were welcome we had in the mean time thrown off our riding skirts and stood just in our plain dresses though the others were freshly dressed for an exodus before the man left the carriage came though by that time we had drawn half the party on our side we said we would take supper and decide after so he went off in a few moments a rocket went up from one of the boats which attracted our attention five minutes after we saw a flash directly before us see it lightning i expect said phillie the others all agreed but i kept quiet knowing that some at least knew what it was as well as i and determined not to give the alarm for i was beginning to feel foolish before half a minute more came a tearing hissing sound a sky rocket whose music i had heard before instantly i remembered my running bag and flew upstairs to get it escaping just in time from the scene which followed on the gallery which was afterwards most humorously described to me but i was out of hearing of the screams of each and yet i must have heard them neither saw miss walters tumble against the wall nor mother turn over her chair nor the general mêlée that followed in which mrs walters trying to scale the carriage was pulled out by uncle will who shouted to his plunging horses first then to the other unreasoning creatures woa there t ain't safe take to the fields take to the woods run to the sugar house take to your heels in a frenzy of excitement i escaped all that and was putting on my hoops and hastily catching up any article that presented itself to me in my speed when the shell burst over the roof and went rolling down on the gallery according to the account of those then below two went far over the house out of sight all three were seen by mr watson who came galloping up in a few moments crying ladies for god's sake leave the house then i heard mother calling sarah you will be killed leave your clothes and run and a hundred ejaculations that came too fast for me to answer except by an occasional coming if you will send me a candle candle was the same as though i had demanded a hand grenade in mother's opinion for she was sure it would be the signal for a bombardment of my exposed room so i tossed down my bundles swept combs and hairpins into my bosom all points up and ravished a candle from some one how quickly i got on then i saved the most useless of articles with the greatest zeal and probably left the most serviceable ones one single dress did my running bag contain a white linen cambric with a tiny pink flower the one i wore when i told hal good bye for the last time the others i left when i got down with my knapsack mother phillie and mrs walters were at randallson's landing august 11th i don't mean those ladies were but that i am at present i'll account for it after i have disposed of the stampede imagine no interruption and continue in the carriage urging uncle will to hurry on and i had hardly time to thrust my sack under their feet before they were off lilly and miss walters were already in the buggy leaving ginnie and me to follow on horseback i ran up after my riding skirt which i was surprised to find behind a trunk and rolled up in it was my running bag with all my treasures i was very much provoked at my carelessness indeed i cannot imagine how it got there for it was the first thing i thought of when i got back there was no one to be seen except ginnie and two negroes who held our horses and who disappeared the instant we were mounted with the exception of two women who were running to the woods we were the only ones on the lot until mr watson galloped up to urge us on again i had to notice this peculiarity about women that the married ones are invariably the first to fly in time of danger and always leave the young ones to take care of themselves here were our three matrons prophesying that the house would be burnt the yankees upon us and all murdered in ten minutes flying down the guerrilla lane and leaving us to encounter the horrors they foretold alone it was a splendid gallop in the bright moonlight over the fields only it was made uncomfortable by the jerking of my running bag until i happily thought of turning it before a hard ride of four miles in about twenty minutes brought us to the house of the man who so kindly offered his hospitality it was a little hut about as large as our parlor and already crowded to overflowing as he was entertaining three families from baton rouge can't imagine where he put them either but it seems to me the poorer the man and the smaller the house the greater the hospitality you meet with there were so many of us that there was not room on the balcony to turn the man wanted to prepare supper but we declined as phillie had sent back for ours which we had missed i saw another instance of the pleasure the vulgar take in the horrible a mr hill speaking of dr nolan told phillie he had no doubt he had been sent to new orleans on the whiteman that carried general williams's body and that every soul had gone down on her fortunately just then the overseer brought a letter from him saying he had gone on another boat or the man's relish of the distressing might have been gratified it was so crowded there that we soon suggested going a short distance beyond to mr lobdell's and staying there for the night as all strenuously objected to our returning home as there was danger from prowling yankees so we mounted again and after a short ride we reached the house where all were evidently asleep but necessity knows no rules and the driver soon aroused an old gentleman who came out and invited us in a middle aged lady met us and made us perfectly at home by leaving us to take care of ourselves most people would have thought it indifference but i knew it was manque de savoir faire merely and preferred doing as i pleased if she had been officious i would have been embarrassed so we walked in the moonlight ginnie and i while the rest sat in the shade and all discussed the fun of the evening those who had been most alarmed laughing loudest the old gentleman insisted that we girls had been the cause of it all that our white bodies i wore a russian shirt and black skirts could easily have caused us to be mistaken for men that at all events three or four people on horseback would be a sufficient pretext for firing a shell or two in short young ladies he said there is no doubt in my mind that you were mistaken for guerrillas and that they only wanted to give you time to reach the woods where they heard they have a camp before shooting at you in short take my advice and never mount a horse again when there is a yankee in sight we were highly gratified at being mistaken for them and pretended to believe it was true i hardly think he was right though it is too preposterous pourtant sunday morning the yankees told a negro they did not mean to touch the house but were shooting at some guerrillas at a camp just beyond we know the last guerrilla left the parish five days ago our host insisted on giving us supper though phillie represented that ours was on the road and by eleven o'clock tired alike of moonlight and fasting we gladly accepted and rapidly made the preserves and batter cakes fly ours was a garret room well finished abounding in odd closets and corners with curious dormer windows that were reached by long little corridors i should have slept well but i lay awake all night mother and i occupied a narrow single bed with a bar of the thickest heaviest material imaginable suffocation awaited me inside gnats and mosquitoes outside in order to be strictly impartial i lay awake to divide my time equally between the two attractions and think i succeeded pretty well so i spent the night on the extreme edge of the bed never turning over but fanning mother constantly i was not sorry when daybreak appeared but dressed and ascended the observatory to get a breath of air below me i beheld four wagons loaded with the young mrs lobdell's baggage the yankees had visited them in the evening swept off everything they could lay their hands on and with a sick child she was obliged to leave her house in the night and fly to her father in law i wondered at their allowing her four wagons of trunks and bundles it was very kind if i were a federal i think it would kill me to hear the whisper of hide the silver wherever i came their having frequently relieved families of such trifles along with negroes teams etc has put others on their guard now as i sat in the parlor in the early morning mrs walters en blouse volante and all échevelée came in to tell me of mr lobdell's misfortunes they took his negroes right hand up his teams left hand up his preserves both hands clutching her hair they swept off everything except four old women who could not walk they told him if he did n't come report himself they'd come fetch him in three days they beggared him both eyes rolling like a ship in a storm i could not help laughing mr bird sat on the gallery and had been served in the same way with the addition of a pair of handcuffs for a little while it was not a laughing matter but the old lady made it comical by her gestures when we suggested returning there was another difficulty all said it was madness that the yankees would sack the house and burn it over our heads we would be insulted etc i said no one yet had ever said an impudent thing to me and yankees certainly would not attempt it but the old gentleman told me i did not know what i was talking about so i hushed but determined to return ginnie and i sat an hour on horseback waiting for the others to settle what they would do and after having half roasted ourselves in the sun they finally agreed to go too and we set off in a gallop which we never broke until we reached the house which to our great delight we found standing and not infested with yankees linwood august 12th another resting place out of reach of shells for the first time since last april for how long i wonder for wherever we go we bring shells and yankees would not be surprised at a visit from them out here now let me take up the thread of that never ending story and account for my present position it all seems tame now but it was very exciting at the time as soon as i threw down bonnet and gloves i commenced writing but before i had halfway finished mother who had been holding a consultation downstairs ran up to say the overseer had advised us all to leave as the place was not safe and that i must pack up instantly as unless we got off before the essex came up it would be impossible to leave at all all was commotion every one flew to pack up phillie determined to go to her friends at grosse tête and insisted on carrying us off with her but i determined to reach miriam and lilly if possible rather than put the federal army between us all en déshabillé i commenced to pack our trunk but had scarcely put an article in when they cried the essex was rounding the point and our last opportunity passing away then i flew and by the time the boat got opposite to us the trunk was locked and i sat on it completely dressed waiting for the wagon we had then to wait for the boat to get out of sight to avoid a broadside so it was half past ten before we set off fortified by several glasses of buttermilk apiece all went in the carriage except ginnie lilly nolan and me and we perched on the baggage in the wagon such stifling heat the wagon jarred dreadfully and seated at the extreme end on a wooden trunk traversed by narrow slats ginnie and i were jolted until we lost our breath all down arkansas lane when we changed for the front part i shall never forget the heat of that day four miles beyond the carriage stopped at some house and still determined to get over the river i stepped into the little cart that held our trunks drove up to the side of it and insisted on mother's getting in rather than going the other way with phillie i had a slight discussion and overcame mother's reluctance to phillie's objections with some difficulty but finally prevailed on the former to get into the cart and jolted off amid a shower of reproaches regrets and good byes i knew i was right though and the idea reconciled me to the heat dust jarring and gunboat that was coming up behind us six miles more brought us to mr cain's where we arrived at two o'clock tired dirty and almost unrecognizable we were received with the greatest cordiality in spite of that mother knew both him and his wife but though i had never seen either the latter kissed me as affectionately as though we had known each other it was impossible to cross when the gunboat was in sight so they made us stay with them until the next morning a bath and clean clothes soon made me quite presentable and i really enjoyed the kindness we met with in spite of a tearing headache and a distended feeling about the eyes as though i never meant to close them again the consequence of my vigil i presume o those dear kind people i shall not soon forget them mr cain told mother he believed he would keep me at all events he would make an exchange and give her his only son in my place i told him i was willing as mother thought much more of her sons than of her daughters i forgot to say that we met general allen's partner a mile or two from dr nolan's who told us it was a wise move that he had intended recommending it all he owned had been carried off his plantation stripped he said he had no doubt that all the coast would be ravaged and they had promised to burn his and many other houses and dr nolan's though it might possibly be spared in consideration of his being a prisoner and his daughter being unprotected would most probably suffer with the rest but even if spared it was no place for women he offered to take charge of us all and send the furniture into the interior before the yankees should land which phillie gladly accepted what a splendid rest i had at mrs cain's i was not conscious of being alive until i awaked abruptly in the early morning with a confused sense of having dreamed something very pleasant mr cain accompanied us to the ferry some miles above riding by the buggy and leaving us under care of mr randallson after seeing us in the large flat took his leave after an hour spent at the hotel after landing on this side we procured a conveyance and came on to mr elder's where we astonished lilly by our unexpected appearance very much miriam had gone over to spend the day with her so we were all together and talked over our adventures with the greatest glee after dinner miriam and i came over here to see them all leaving the others to follow later i was very glad to see helen carter once more if i was not i hope i may live in yankee land and i can't invoke a more dreadful punishment than that well here we are and heaven only knows our next move but we must settle on some spot which seems impossible in the present state of affairs when no lodgings are to be found i feel like a homeless beggar will pinckney told them here that he doubted if our house were still standing as the fight occurred just back of it and every volley directed towards it he says he thought of it every time the cannon was fired knowing where the shot would go august 13th i am in despair miss jones who has just made her escape from town brings a most dreadful account she with seventy five others took refuge at dr enders's more than a mile and a half below town at hall's it was there we sent the two trunks containing father's papers and our clothing and silver hearing that guerrillas had been there the yankees went down shelled the house in the night turning all those women and children out who barely escaped with their clothing and let the soldiers loose on it they destroyed everything they could lay their hands on if it could not be carried off broke open armoirs trunks sacked the house and left it one scene of devastation and ruin they even stole miss jones's braid she got here with nothing but the clothes she wore this is a dreadful blow to me yesterday i thought myself beggared when i heard that our house was probably burnt remembering all the clothing books furniture etc that it contained but i consoled myself with the recollection of a large trunk packed in the most scientific style containing quantities of nightgowns skirts chemises dresses cloaks in short our very best which was in safety winter had no terrors when i thought of the nice warm clothes i only wished i had a few of the organdie dresses i had packed up before wearing and now it is all gone silver father's law papers without which we are beggars and clothing nothing left i could stand that but as each little article of harry's came up before me i had put many in the trunk i lost heart they may clothe their negro women with my clothes since they only steal for them but to take things so sacred to me o my god teach me to forgive them poor miss jones they went into her clothes bag and took out articles which were certainly of no service to them for mere deviltry there are so many sufferers in this case that it makes it still worse the plantation just below was served in the same way whole families fired into before they knew of the intention of the yankees was it not fine sport i have always been an advocate of peace if we could name the conditions ourselves but i say war to the death i would give my life to be able to take arms against the vandals who are laying waste our fair land i suppose it is because i have no longer anything to lose that i am desperate before i always opposed the burning of baton rouge as a useless piece of barbarism in turning out five thousand women and children on the charity of the world but i noticed that those who had no interest there warmly advocated it lilly nolan cried loudly for it thought it only just but the first shell that whistled over her father's house made her crazy with rage the brutes the beasts how cruel wicked etc it was too near home for her then there is the greatest difference between my property and yours i notice that the further i get from town the more ardent are the people to have it burned it recalls very forcibly thackeray's cut in the virginians when speaking of the determination of the rebels to burn the cities he says he observed that all those who were most eager to burn new york were inhabitants of boston while those who were most zealous to burn boston had all their property in new york it is true all the world over and i am afraid i am becoming indifferent about the fate of our town anything so it is speedily settled tell me it would be of service to the confederacy and i would set fire to my home if still standing willingly but would it august 17th another sunday strange that the time which should seem so endless flies so rapidly miriam complains that sunday comes every day but though that seems a little too much i insist that it comes twice a week let time fly though for each day brings us so much nearer our destiny which i long to know thursday we heard from a lady just from town that our house was standing the day before which somewhat consoled us for the loss of our silver and clothing but yesterday came the tidings of new afflictions i declare we have acted out the first chapter of job all except that verse about the death of his sons and daughters god shield us from that i do not mind the rest while he was yet speaking another came in and said thy brethren and kinsmen gathered together to wrest thine abode from the hand of the philistines which pressed sore upon thee when lo the philistines sallied forth with fire and sword and laid thine habitation waste and desolate and i only am escaped to tell thee yes the yankees fearing the confederates might slip in unseen resolved to have full view of their movements so put the torch to all eastward from colonel matta's to the advocate that would lay open a fine tract of country alone but unfortunately it is said that once started it was not so easy to control the flames which spread considerably beyond their appointed limits some say it went as far as florida street if so we are lost as that is a half square below us for several days the fire has been burning but very little can be learned of the particulars i am sorry for colonel matta such a fine brown stone front the finest in town poor minna poverty will hardly agree with her as for our home i hope against hope i will not believe it is burnt until somebody declares having been present on that occasion yet so many frame houses on that square must have readily caught fire from the sparks wicked as it may seem i would rather have all i own burned than in the possession of the negroes fancy my magenta organdie on a dark beauty bah i think the sight would enrage me miss jones's trials are enough to drive her crazy she had the pleasure of having four officers in her house men who sported epaulets and red sashes accompanied by a negro woman at whose disposal all articles were placed the worthy companion of these gentlemen walked around selecting things with the most natural airs and graces this she would say we must have and some of these books you know and all the preserves and these chairs and tables and all the clothes of course and yes the rest of these things so she would go on the gentlemen assuring her she had only to choose what she wanted and that they would have them removed immediately madame thought they really must have the wine and those handsome cut glass goblets i hardly think i could have endured such a scene to see all i owned given to negroes without even an accusation being brought against me of disloyalty 1 one officer departed with a fine velvet cloak on his arm another took such a bundle of miss jones's clothes that he had to have it lifted by some one else on his horse and rode off holding it with difficulty this i heard from herself yesterday as i spent the day with lilly and mother at mr elder's where she is now staying can anything more disgraceful be imagined they all console me by saying there is no one in baton rouge who could possibly wear my dresses without adding a considerable piece to the belt but that is nonsense another pull at the corset strings would bring them easily to the size i have been reduced by nature and bones besides o horror suppose instead they should let in a piece of another color that would annihilate me pshaw i do not care for the dresses if they had only left me those little articles of father's and harry's but that is hard to forgive august 19th yesterday two colonels shields and breaux both of whom distinguished themselves in the battle of baton rouge dined here their personal appearance was by no means calculated to fill me with awe or even to give one an idea of their rank for their dress consisted of merely cottonade pants flannel shirts and extremely short jackets which however is rapidly becoming the uniform of the confederate states just three lines back three soldiers came in to ask for molasses i was alone downstairs and the nervous trepidation with which i received the dirty coarsely clad strangers who however looked as though they might be gentlemen has raised a laugh against me from the others who looked down from a place of safety i don't know what i did that was out of the way i felt odd receiving them as though it was my home and having to answer their questions about buying by means of acting as telegraph between them and mrs carter i confess to that but i know i talked reasonably about the other subjects playing hostess in a strange house of course it was uncomfortable and to add to my embarrassment the handsomest one offered to pay for the milk he had just drunk fancy my feelings as i hastened to assure him that general carter never received money for such things and from a soldier besides it was not to be thought of he turned to the other saying in mississippi we don't meet with such people miss they don't hesitate to charge four bits a canteen for milk they take all they can they are not like you louisianians i was surprised to hear him say it of his own state but told him we thought here we could not do enough for them august 20th last evening after hard labor at pulling molasses candy needing some relaxation after our severe exertions we determined to have some fun though the sun was just setting in clouds as watery as new orleans milk and promised an early twilight all day it had been drizzling but that was nothing so anna badger miriam and i set off through the mud to get up the little cart to ride in followed by cries from the elder ladies of girls soap is a dollar and a half a bar starch a dollar a pound take up those skirts we had all started stiff and clean and it did seem a pity to let them drag so up they went you can imagine how high when i tell you my answer to anna's question as to whether hers were in danger of touching the mud was not unless you sit down the only animal we could discover that was not employed was a poor old pony most appropriately called tom thumb and him we seized instantly together with a man to harness him we accompanied him from the stable to the quarter where the cart was through mud and water urging him on with shouts and cries and laughing until we could laugh no longer at the appearance of each the cart had been hauling wood but that was nothing to us in we tumbled and with a driver as diminutive as the horse started off for mr elder's where we picked up all the children to be found and went on all told we were twelve drawn by that poor horse who seemed at each step about to undergo the ham process and leave us his hind quarters while he escaped with the fore ones and harness i dare say we never enjoyed a carriage as much though each was holding a muddy child riding was very fine but soon came the question how shall we turn which was not so easily solved for neither horse nor boy understood it in the least every effort to describe a circle brought us the length of the cart farther up the road and we promised fair to reach bayou sara before morning at that rate at last after fruitless efforts to dodge under the harness and escape pony came to a standstill and could not be induced to move the children took advantage of the pause to tumble out but we sat still bogged and it was very dark already would n't we get it when we got home anna groaned uncle albert miriam laughed the general i sighed mrs carter we knew what we deserved and darker and darker it grew and pony still inflexible at last we beheld a buggy on a road near by and in answer to morgan's shouts of uncle uncle come turn our cart a gentleman jumped out and in an instant performed the herculean task pony found motion so agreeable that it was with the greatest difficulty we prevailed on him to stop while we fished seven children out of the mud as they pursued his flying hoofs once more at mr elder's we pitched them out without ceremony and drove home as fast as possible trying to fancy what punishment we would receive for being out so late miriam suggested as the most horrible one being sent to bed supperless anna's terror was the general's displeasure i suggested being deprived of rides in future when all agreed that mine was the most severe yet so as we drove around the circle those two set up what was meant for a hearty laugh to show they were not afraid which however sounded rather shaky to me i don't think any of us felt like facing the elders miriam suggested anticipating our fate by retiring voluntarily to bed anna thought we had best run up and change our shoes anyway but at last with her dare devil laugh miriam sauntered into the room where they all were followed by us and thrusting her wet feet into the fire that was kindled to drive away the damp followed also by us commenced a laughable account of our fun in which we of course followed too if i had fancied we were to escape scot free we would most surely have got a scolding it is almost an inducement to hope always for the worst the general did not mention the hour did not prohibit future rides while we were yet toasting a negro came in with what seemed a bank note and asked his master to see how much it was as one of the women had sold some of her watermelons to the three soldiers of the morning who had given that to her for a dollar the general opened it it was a pass so vanish all faith in human nature they looked so honest i could never have believed it of them but it looked so much like the shinplasters we are forced to use that no wonder they made the mistake to discover who had played so mean a trick on the poor old woman the general asked me if i could decipher the name i threw myself on my knees by the hearth and by the flickering light read s kimes by order of c h luzenberg provost marshal onolona miss with a gasp of astonishment that raised a burst of laughter against me thought he was taken prisoner long ago at all events i did n't know he had turned banker or that his valuable autograph was worth a dollar august 21st miriam and mother are going to baton rouge in a few hours to see if anything can be saved from the general wreck from the reports of the removal of the penitentiary machinery state library washington statue etc we presume that that part of the town yet standing is to be burnt like the rest i think though that mother has delayed too long however i dreamed last night that we had saved a great deal in trunks and my dreams sometimes come true waking with that impression i was surprised a few hours after to hear mother's sudden determination but i also dreamed i was about to marry a federal officer that was in consequence of having answered the question whether i would do so with an emphatic yes if i loved him which will probably ruin my reputation as a patriot in this parish bah i am no bigot or fool either august 23d yesterday anna and i spent the day with lilly and the rain in the evening obliged us to stay all night dr perkins stopped there and repeated the same old stories we have been hearing about the powder placed under the state house and garrison to blow them up if forced to evacuate the town he confirms the story about all the convicts being set free and the town being pillaged by the negroes and the rest of the yankees he says his own slaves told him they were allowed to enter the houses and help themselves and what they did not want the yankees either destroyed on the spot or had it carried to the garrison and burned they also bragged of having stopped ladies on the street cut their necklaces from their necks and stripped the rings from their fingers without hesitation it may be that they were just bragging to look great in the eyes of their masters i hope so for heaven help them if they fall into the hands of the confederates if it is true i could not record all the stories of wanton destruction that reached us i would rather not believe that the federal government could be so disgraced by its own soldiers dr day says they left nothing at all in his house and carried everything off from dr enders's he does not believe we have a single article left in ours i hope they spared miriam's piano but they say the soldiers had so many that they offered them for sale at five dollars apiece we heard that the town had been completely evacuated and all had gone to new orleans except three gunboats that were preparing to shell before leaving this morning withers's battery passed mr elder's on their way to port hudson and stopped to get water there were several buckets served by several servants but i took possession of one to their great amusement what a profusion of thanks over a can of water it made me smile and they smiled to see my work so it was all very funny it was astonishing to see the number of yankee canteens in the possession of our men almost all those who fought at baton rouge are provided with them in their canvas and wire cases with neat stoppers they are easily distinguished from our rough flat tin ones i declare i felt ever so important in my new situation as waiting maid there is very little we would not do for our soldiers though there is mother for instance who got on her knees to bathe the face and hands of a fever struck soldier of the arkansas while the girls held the plates of those who were too weak to hold them and eat at the same time blessed is the confederate soldier who has even toothache when there are women near what sympathies and remedies are volunteered i always laugh as i did then when i think of the supposed wounded man those girls discovered on that memorable arkansas day i must first acknowledge that it was my fault for seized with compassion for a man supported by two others who headed the procession i cried oh look he is wounded oh poor fellow screamed the others while tears and exclamations flowed abundantly until one of the men smiling humorously cried out nothing the matter with him and on nearer view i perceived it was laziness or perhaps something else and was forced to laugh at the streaming eyes of those tender hearted girls august 24th sunday soon after dinner yesterday two soldiers stopped here and requested permission to remain all night the word soldier was enough for us and without even seeing them anna and i gladly surrendered our room and said we would sleep in mrs badger's instead however i had no curiosity to see the heroes and remained up here reading until the bell summoned me to supper when i took my seat without looking at them as no introduction was possible from their having refrained from giving their names presently i heard the words that retreat from norfolk was badly conducted i looked up and saw before me a rather good looking man covered with the greatest profusion of gold cloth and buttons for which i intuitively despised him the impulse seized me so i spoke were you there no but near by i was there with the first louisiana for most a year do you know george morgan know george yes indeed you are his sister this was an assertion but i bowed assent and he went on thought so from the resemblance i remember seeing you ten years ago when you were a very little girl i used to be at your house with the boys we were schoolmates i remarked that i had no recollection of him of course not he said but did not inform me of his name he talked very familiarly of the boys and said he had met them all at richmond next he astounded me by saying he was a citizen of baton rouge though he had been almost four years in new york before the war broke out he was going to town to look after the property hearing his father had gone to france an inhabitant of that city who was so familiar with my brothers and me and with whom i was not acquainted here was a riddle to solve let us see who among our acquaintances had gone to france i could think of none i made up my mind to find out his name if i had to ask it all through supper he talked and when in country style the gentlemen left us at table i found the curiosity of the others was even more excited than mine i was determined to know who he was then in the parlor he made some remark about never having been in ladies society the whole time he was in virginia i expressed my surprise as george often wrote of the pleasant young ladies he met everywhere oh yes said monsieur but it is impossible to do your duty as an officer and be a lady's man so i devoted myself to my military profession exclusively insufferable puppy i said to myself then he told me of how his father thought he was dead and asked if i had heard of his rallying twenty men at manassas and charging a federal regiment which instantly broke i honestly told him no iagoo the great boaster i decided abruptly he said there were very few nice young ladies in baton rouge probably so in his circle i thought while i dryly remarked indeed oh yes and still more abruptly he said ain't you the youngest yes i thought so i remember you when you were a wee thing so high placing his hand at a most insultingly short distance from the floor really i must ask your name i said he hesitated a moment and then said in a low tone de j de what i absurdly asked thinking i was mistaken a de j he repeated i bowed slightly to express my satisfaction said anna we must retire and with a good night to my newly discovered gentleman went upstairs he is the one i heard george speak of last december when he was here as having been court martialed and shot according to the universal belief in the army that was the only time i had ever heard his name though i was quite familiar with the cart of de j père as it perambulated the streets my first impressions are seldom erroneous from the first i knew that man's respectability was derived from his buttons that is why he took such pride in them and contemplated them with such satisfaction they lent him social backbone enough to converse so familiarly with me without the effulgence of that splendid gold which he hoped would dazzle my eye to his real position he would have hardly dared to remember me when i was a wee thing so high is he the only man whose coat alone entitles him to respectability he may be colonel for all i know but still he is a de j to me he talked brave enough to be general this morning i met him with a cordial good morning mr de j anxious to atone for several snubs i had given him long before i knew his name last night you see i could afford to be patronizing now but the name probably and the fluency with which i pronounced it proved too much for him and after good morning miss morgan he did not venture a word we knew each other then his name was no longer a secret august 25th about 12 at night sleep is impossible after all that i have heard so after vainly endeavoring to follow the example of the rest and sleep like a stoic i have lighted my candle and take to this to induce drowsiness just after supper when anna and i were sitting with mrs carter in her room i talking as usual of home and saying i would be perfectly happy if mother would decide to remain in baton rouge and brave the occasional shellings i heard a well known voice take up some sentence of mine from a dark part of the room and with a cry of surprise i was hugging miriam until she was breathless such a forlorn creature so dirty tired and fatigued as to be hardly recognizable we thrust her into a chair and made her speak she had just come with charlie who went after them yesterday and had left mother and the servants at a kind friend's on the road i never heard such a story as she told i was heartsick but i laughed until mrs badger grew furious with me and the yankees and abused me for not abusing them she says when she entered the house she burst into tears at the desolation it was one scene of ruin libraries emptied china smashed sideboards split open with axes three cedar chests cut open plundered and set up on end all parlor ornaments carried off even the alabaster apollo and diana that hal valued so much her piano dragged to the centre of the parlor had been abandoned as too heavy to carry off her desk lay open with all letters and notes well thumbed and scattered around while will's last letter to her was open on the floor with the yankee stamp of dirty fingers mother's portrait half cut from its frame stood on the floor margret who was present at the sacking told how she had saved father's it seems that those who wrought destruction in our house were all officers one jumped on the sofa to cut the picture down miriam saw the prints of his muddy feet when margret cried for god's sake gentlemen let it be i'll help you to anything here he's dead and the young ladies would rather see the house burn than lose it i'll blow your damned brains out was the gentleman's answer as he put a pistol to her head which a brother officer dashed away and the picture was abandoned for finer sport all the others were cut up in shreds upstairs was the finest fun mother's beautiful mahogany armoir whose single door was an extremely fine mirror was entered by crashing through the glass when it was emptied of every article and the shelves half split and half thrust back crooked letters labeled by the boys private were strewn over the floor they opened every armoir and drawer collected every rag to be found and littered the whole house with them until the wonder was where so many rags had been found father's armoir was relieved of everything gibbes's handsome damascus sword with the silver scabbard included all his clothes george's hal's jimmy's were appropriated they entered my room broke that fine mirror for sport pulled down the rods from the bed and with them pulverized my toilet set taking also all lydia's china ornaments i had packed in the wash stand the débris filled my basin and ornamented my bed my desk was broken open over it was spread all my letters and private papers a diary i kept when twelve years old and sundry tokens of dried roses etc which must have been very funny they all being labeled with the donor's name and the occasion fool how i writhe when i think of all they saw the invitations to buggy rides concerts compliments of etc lilly's sewing machine had disappeared but as mother's was too heavy to move they merely smashed the needles in the pillaging of the armoirs they seized a pink flounced muslin of miriam's which one officer placed on the end of a bayonet and paraded round with followed by the others who slashed it with their swords crying i have stuck the damned secesh that's the time i cut her and continued their sport until the rags could no longer be pierced one seized my bonnet with which he decked himself and ran in the streets indeed all who found such rushed frantically around town by way of frolicking with the things on their heads they say no frenzy could surpass it another snatched one of my calico dresses and a pair of vases that mother had when she was married and was about to decamp when a mrs jones jerked them away and carried them to her boarding house and returned them to mother the other day blessed be heaven i have a calico dress our clothes were used for the vilest purposes and spread in every corner at least those few that were not stolen aunt barker's charles tried his best to defend the property ain't you shamed to destroy all dis here that belongs to a poor widow lady who's got two daughters to support he asked of an officer who was foremost in the destruction poor damn them i don't know when i have seen a house furnished like this look at that furniture they poor was the retort and thereupon the work went bravely on of making us poor indeed it would have fared badly with us had we been there the servants say they broke into the house crying where are those damned secesh women we know they are hid in here and we ll make them dance for hiding from federal officers and they could not be convinced that we were not there until they had searched the very garret wonder what they would have done charles caught a captain clark in the streets when the work was almost over and begged him to put an end to it the gentleman went readily but though the devastation was quite evident no one was to be seen and he was about to leave when insisting that there was some one there charles drew him into my room dived under the bed and drew from thence a yankee captain by one leg followed by a lieutenant each with a bundle of the boys clothes which they instantly dropped protesting they were only looking around the house the gentleman captain carried them off to their superior ours was the most shockingly treated house in the whole town we have the misfortune to be equally feared by both sides because we will blackguard neither so the yankees selected the only house in town that sheltered three forlorn women to wreak their vengeance on from far and near strangers and friends flocked in to see the ravages committed crowds rushed in before crowds came in after miriam and mother arrived all apologizing for the intrusion but saying they had heard it was a sight never before seen so they let them examine to their hearts content and miriam says the sympathy of all was extraordinary a strange gentleman picked up a piece of mother's mirror which was as thick as his finger saying madame i should like to keep this as a memento i am about to travel through mississippi and having seen what a splendid piece of furniture this was and the state your house is left in should like to show this as a specimen of yankee vandalism william waller flew to our home to try to save it but was too late they say he burst into tears as he looked around while on his kind errand another band of yankees burst into his house and left not one article of clothing to him except the suit he had on the whole talk is about our dreadful treatment at the yankees hands dr day and dr enders in spite of the assertions of the former lost nothing well i am beggared strange to say i don't feel it perhaps it is the satisfaction of knowing my fate that makes me so cheerful that mrs carter envied my stoicism while mrs badger felt like beating me because i did not agree that there was no such thing as a gentleman in the yankee army i know major drum for one and that captain clark must be two and mr biddle is three and general williams god bless him wherever he is for he certainly acted like a christian the yankees boasted loudly that if it had not been for him the work would have been done long ago and now i am determined to see my home before yankee shells complete the work that yankee axes spared so by sunrise i shall post over to mr elder's and insist on charlie taking me to town with him i hardly think it is many hours off i feel so settled so calm just as though i never meant to sleep again if i only had a desk a luxury i have not enjoyed since i left home i could write for hours still without being sleepy but this curved attitude is hard on my stiff back so good night while i lie down to gain strength for a sight they say will make me faint with distress nous verrons if i say i won't i know i ll not cry the brunots lost nothing at all from their house thank heaven for the mercy only they lost all their money in their flight on the door on their return they found written ladies i have done my best for you signed by a yankee soldier who they suppose to be the one who has made it a habit of continually passing their house forgot to say miriam recovered my guitar from the asylum our large trunk and father's papers untouched from dr enders's and with her piano the two portraits a few mattresses all that is left of housekeeping affairs and father's law books carried them out of town for which i say in all humility blessed be god who has spared us so much thursday august 28th i am satisfied i have seen my home again tuesday i was up at sunrise and my few preparations were soon completed and before any one was awake i walked over to mr elder's through mud and dew to meet charlie fortunate was it for me that i started so early for i found him hastily eating his breakfast and ready to leave he was very much opposed to my going and for some time i was afraid he would force me to remain but at last he consented perhaps because i did not insist and with wet feet and without a particle of breakfast i at length found myself in the buggy on the road home the ride afforded me a series of surprises half the time i found myself halfway out of the little low necked buggy when i thought i was safely in and the other half i was surprised to find myself really in when i thought i was wholly out and so on for mile after mile over muddy roads until we came to a most terrific cross road where we were obliged to pass and which is best undescribed four miles from town we stopped at mrs brown's to see mother and after a few moments talk went on our road i saw the first yankee camp that will pinckney and colonel bird had set fire to the day of the battle such a shocking sight of charred wood burnt clothes tents and all imaginable articles strewn around i had never before seen i should have been very much excited entering the town by the route our soldiers took but i was not it all seemed tame and familiar i could hardly fancy i stood on the very spot where the severest struggle had taken place the next turn of the road brought us to two graves one on each side of the road the resting place of two who fell that day they were merely left in the ditch where they fell and earth from the side was pulled over them when miriam passed parts of their coats were sticking out of the grave but some kind hand had scattered fresh earth over them when i saw them beyond the sight became more common i was told that their hands and feet were visible from many and one poor fellow lay unburied just as he had fallen with his horse across him and both skeletons that sight i was spared as the road near which he was iying was blocked up by trees so we were forced to go through the woods to enter instead of passing by the catholic graveyard in the woods we passed another camp our men destroyed while the torn branches above testified to the number of shells our men had braved to do the work next to mr barbee's were the remains of a third camp that was burned and a few more steps made me suddenly hold my breath for just before us lay a dead horse with the flesh still hanging which was hardly endurable close by lay a skeleton whether of man or horse i did not wait to see not a human being appeared until we reached the penitentiary which was occupied by our men after that i saw crowds of wagons moving furniture out but not a creature that i knew just back of our house was all that remained of a nice brick cottage namely four crumbling walls the offense was that the husband was fighting for the confederates so the wife was made to suffer and is now homeless like many thousands besides it really seems as though god wanted to spare our homes the frame dwellings adjoining were not touched even the town was hardly recognizable and required some skill to avoid the corners blocked up by trees so as to get in at all our house could not be reached by the front so we left the buggy in the back yard and running through the lot without stopping to examine the storeroom and servants rooms that opened wide i went through the alley and entered by the front door fortunate was it for this record that i undertook to describe the sacking only from miriam's account if i had waited until now it would never have been mentioned for as i looked around to attempt such a thing seemed absurd i stood in the parlor in silent amazement and in answer to charlie's well i could only laugh it was so hard to realize as i looked for each well known article i could hardly believe that abraham lincoln's officers had really come so low down as to steal in such a wholesale manner the papier maché workbox miriam had given me was gone the baby sacque i was crocheting with all knitting needles and wools gone also of all the beautiful engravings of annapolis that will pinckney had sent me there remained a single one gentlemen my name is written on each not a book remained in the parlor except idyls of the king that contained my name also and which together with the door plate was the only case in which the name of morgan was spared they must have thought we were related to john morgan and wreaked their vengeance on us for that reason thanks for the honor but there is not the slightest connection where they did not carry off articles bearing our name they cut it off as in the visiting cards and left only the first name every book of any value or interest except hume and gibbon was borrowed permanently i regretted macaulay more than all the rest brother's splendid french histories went too all except l'histoire de la bastille however as they spared father's law libraries all except one volume they used to support a flour barrel with while they emptied it near the parlor door we ought to be thankful the dining room was very funny i looked around for the cut glass celery and preserve dishes that were to be part of my dot as mother always said together with the champagne glasses that had figured on the table the day that i was born but there remained nothing there was plenty of split up furniture though i stood in mother's room before the shattered armoir which i could hardly believe the same that i had smoothed my hair before as i left home three weeks previously father's was split across and the lock torn off and in the place of the hundreds of articles it contained i saw two bonnets at the sight of which i actually sat down to laugh one was mother's velvet which looked very much like a football in its present condition mine was not to be found as the officers forgot to return it wonder who has my imperial i know they never saw a handsomer one with its black velvet purple silk and ostrich feathers i went to my room gone was my small paradise had this shocking place ever been habitable the tall mirror squinted at me from a thousand broken angles it looked so knowing i tried to fancy the yankee officers being dragged from under my bed by the leg thanks to charles but it seemed too absurd so i let them alone my desk what a sight the central part i had kept as a little curiosity shop with all my little trinkets and keepsakes of which a large proportion were from my gentlemen friends i looked for all i had left found only a piece of the mcrae which as it was labeled in full i was surprised they had spared precious letters i found under heaps of broken china and rags all my notes were gone with many letters i looked for a letter of poor in cipher with the key attached and name signed in plain hand i knew it would hardly be agreeable to him to have it read and it certainly would be unpleasant to me to have it published but i could not find it miriam thinks she saw something answering the description somewhere though bah what is the use of describing such a scene 1 many suffered along with us though none so severely indeed the yankees cursed loudly at those who did not leave anything worth stealing they cannot complain of us on that score all our handsome brussels carpets together with lydia's fur were taken too what did they not take in the garret in its darkest corner a whole gilt edged china set of lydia's had been overlooked so i set to work and packed it up while charlie packed her furniture in a wagon to send to her father it was now three o'clock and with my light linen dress thrown off i was standing over a barrel putting in cups and saucers as fast as i could wrap them in the rags that covered the floor when mr larguier sent me a nice little dinner i had been so many hours without eating nineteen i think during three of which i had slept that i had lost all appetite but nevertheless i ate it to show my appreciation if i should here after think that the quantity of rags was exaggerated let me here state that after i had packed the barrel and china with them it made no perceptible diminution of the pile as soon as i had finished my task charlie was ready to leave again so i left town without seeing or hearing any one or any thing except what lay in my path as we drove out of the gate i begged charlie to let me get my bird as i heard charles barker had him a man was dispatched and in a few minutes returned with my jimmy i have since heard that tiche deserted him the day of the battle as i so much feared she would and that charles found him late in the evening and took charge of him with my pet once more with me we drove off again i cast many a longing look at the graveyard but knowing charlie did not want to stop i said nothing though i had been there but once in three months and that once six weeks ago i could see where the fence had been thrown down by our soldiers as they charged the federals but it was now replaced though many a picket was gone once more i stopped at mrs brown's while charlie went on to clinton leaving me to drive mother here in the morning early yesterday after seeing miriam's piano and the mattresses packed up and on the road we started off in the buggy and after a tedious ride through a melting sun arrived here about three o'clock having again missed my dinner which i kept a profound secret until supper time by next ash wednesday i will have learned how to fast without getting sick though very tired i sat sewing until after sunset dictating a page and a half to anna who was writing to howell august 29 clinton la noah's duck has found another resting place yesterday i was interrupted while writing to pack up for another move it being impossible to find a boarding house in the neighborhood we heard of some about here and charlie had engaged a house for his family where the servants were already settled so i hurried off to my task no easy one either considering the heat and length of time allowed this time i ate dinner as i packed again about four finding miriam did not come to mr elder's as she promised i started over to general carter's with her clothes and found her just getting into the buggy to ride over as i arrived warm tired hardly able to stand after taking her over the general sent the buggy back for mrs carter and myself and soon we were all assembled waiting for the cars at last determining to wait for them near the track we started off again general carter driving me in his buggy i love general carter again after so many kind invitations he told me he was sorry we would not remain with him if we were content he would be only too happy to have us with him and spoke so kindly that i felt as though i had a yankee ball in my throat i was disposed to be melancholy anyway i could not say many words without choking i was going from the kindest of friends to a country where i had none at all so could not feel very gay as we reached the track the cars came shrieking along there was a pause a scufffle during which the general placed me and my bird in a seat while lilly charlie miriam mother five children and two servants with all the baggage were thrown aboard some way when with a shriek and a jerk we were off again without a chance of saying good bye even i enjoyed that ride it had but one fault and that was that it came to an end i would have wished it to spin along until the war was over or we in a settled home but it ended at last to jimmy's great relief for he was too frightened to move even and only ventured a timid chirp if the car stopped as if to ask is it over nothing occurred of any interest except once a little boy sent us slightly off the track by meddling with the brakes landed at sunset it is hard to fancy a more forlorn crew while waiting at the depot to get the baggage off before coming to the house we burst out laughing as we looked at each lengthened face such a procession through the straggling village has hardly been seen before how we laughed at our forlorn plight as we trudged through the hilly streets they have no pavements here looking like emigrants from the ould counthry as we have watched them in new orleans at the house we found tiche laid up the loaded wagon with its baggage four mules three grown servants and four children was precipitated from a bridge twenty five feet high by the breaking of the before mentioned causeway and landed with the whole concern in deep water below wonderful to relate not a life was lost the mattress on which the negroes remained seated floated them off into shallow water the only one hurt was tiche who had her leg severely sprained the baggage was afterwards fished out rather wet in the mud next morning it happened late at night dophy found a tiny fancy bottle that she had secreted from the yankees a present from clemmy luzenberg it was and one of two things left in my curiosity shop by the yankees after seeing everything in we started off for the hotel where we arrived after dark rather tired i think not a comfortable house either unless you call a bare unfurnished dirty room without shutter or anything else comfortable particularly when you are to sleep on the floor with four children and three grown people and a servant after breakfast we came here until we can find a place to settle in which mr marsden has promised to attend to for us it is rather rough housekeeping yet but lilly has not yet got settled our dinner was rather primitive there was a knife and fork to carve the meat and then it was finished with spoons i sat on the floor with my plate and a piece of cornbread flour not to be bought at any price and ate with my fingers a new experience i found that water can be drunk out of a cup ouf i am tired august 30th still no prospect of a lodging so here we remain i never before lived in a house without a balcony and have only now found out how inconvenient it is the whole establishment consists of two rooms on each side of a passage as wide as the front door and as it has a very low ceiling with no opening and no shade near it is decidedly the warmest spot i ever inhabited we all sleep on the floor and keep our clothes in our trunks except lilly who has an armoir without doors knives and forks for dinner to day though the table still consists of a single plank the house really has a suffocating effect on me there is such a close look about it the front is fully a foot below the level of the street while quite a flight of steps leads from the back door to the yard in fact the whole town consists of abrupt little mounds it is rather a pretty place but heaven save me from the misery of living in it miriam is crazy to remain even advocates that dirty bare shutterless boarding house where we passed the first night from what attraction i cannot imagine i am just as anxious to get into the country i would hate the dull round of this little place i prefer solitude where i can do as i please without being observed here we are as well known by people we never before heard of as though we were fellow citizens
new orleans august 1863 friday 14th doomed to be bored to night miriam drags me to a soirée musicale and in the midst of my toilet i sit down with bare shoulders to scratch a dozen lines in my new treasure which has been by me for three days untouched i don't know what tempts me to do it except perversity for i have nothing to say i was in hopes that i would never have occasion to refer to the disagreeable subject that occupied the last pages of my old journal but the hope proves fallacious and wherever i turn the same subject is renewed so there is no longer any reason in waiting until all mention can be avoided yesterday a little sly snaky creature asked me if i knew the hero of port hudson yes i said briefly unmistakable i see it in your face she remarked see what that you betray yourself do you know that every one believes that you are engaged to him in surprise i said no such a thing had never been mentioned before me until then well they say so and add too that you are to be married as soon as the war is over they are paying me an undeserved compliment i returned where could such a report have originated not certainly from him and not most assuredly from me where does dame rumor spring from he is a stranger here and i have never mentioned his name except to the peirces who would no more report such a thing than i would myself i won't mind it if it does not reach his ears but what assurance have i that it will not that would be unpleasant why can't they say let everybody settle their own affairs here comes miriam after me what a bore what a bore and she looks as though it was a pleasure to go out how i hate it glancing up the page the date strikes my eye what tempted me to begin it friday my dear ada would shiver and declare the blank pages were reserved for some very painful awful uncomfortable record or that something would happen before the end of it nothing very exciting can happen except the restoration of peace and to bring that about i would make a vow to write only on fridays sunday 16th coming out of church this morning with miriam a young lady ran up with an important air as though about to create a sensation i have a message for you both she said fixing her eyes on mine as though she sought something in them i visit the prisoners frequently you know and day before yesterday captain steadman requested me to beg you to call that he will not take a refusal but entreated you to come if it were only once the fates must be against me i had almost forgotten his existence and having received the same message frequently from another i thoughtlessly said you mean colonel do you not fortunately miriam asked the same question at the instant that i was beginning to believe i had done something very foolish the lady looked at me with her calm scrutinizing disagreeable smile a smile that had all the unpleasant insinuations eyes and lips can convey a smile that looked like i have your secret you can't deceive me and said with her piercing gaze no not the colonel he was very ill that day did you know it and could not see us this was really the captain he is very kind i stammered and suggested to miriam that we had better pass on the lady was still eyeing me inquisitively decidedly this is unpleasant to have the reputation of being engaged to a man that every girl is crazy to win if one only cared for him it would not be so unpleasant but under the circumstances ah ça why don't they make him over to the young lady whose father openly avows he would be charmed to have him for a son in law this report has cost me more than one impertinent stare the young ladies think it a very enviable position let some of them usurp it then so the young lady not having finished her examination proposed to accompany us part of the way as a recompense we were regaled with charming little anecdotes about herself and her visits how she had sent a delightful little custard to the colonel here was a side glance at my demure face and had carried an autographic album in her last visit and had insisted on their inscribing their names and writing a verse or so how interesting was my mental comment can a man respect a woman who thrusts him her album begging for a compliment the first time they meet what fools they must think us if they take such as these for specimens of the genus did we know captain lanier know him no but how vividly his face comes before me when i look back to that grand smash up at port hudson when his face was the last i saw before being thrown and the first i recognized when i roused myself from my stupor and found myself in the arms of the young alabamian at the sound of his name i fairly saw the last ray of sunset flashing over his handsome face as i saw it then no i did not know him he had spoken to me begging to be allowed to hold me and i had answered entreating him not to touch me and that was all i knew of him but she did not wait for the reply she hurried on to say that she had sent him a bouquet with a piece of poetry and that he had been heard to exclaim how beautiful on reading it and do you know she continued with an air that was meant to be charmingly naïf but which was not very successful as naïveté at twenty nine is rather flat i am so much afraid he thinks it original i forgot to put quotation marks and it would be so funny in him to make the mistake for you know i have not much of the of that sort of thing about me i am not a poet poetess author you know said miriam in her blandest tone without a touch of sarcasm in her voice oh if he has ever seen you the mistake is natural if i had spoken my voice would have carried a sting in it so i waited until i could calmly say you know him well of course no i never saw him before she answered with a new outburst of naïveté monday august 24th a letter from captain bradford to miriam my poor adonis that i used to ridicule so unmercifully what misfortunes have befallen him he writes that during the siege at port hudson he had the top of his ear shot off wonder if he lost any of that beautiful golden fleece yclept his hair and had the cap of his knee removed by a shell besides a third wound he does not specify fortunately he is with kind friends and he gives news of lydia most acceptable since such a time has elapsed since we heard from her he says tell miss sarah that the last i saw of john he was crossing the mississippi in a skiff his parole in his pocket his sweet little sister by his side o you wretch at it again and somebody else in his heart how considerate to volunteer the last statement then followed half a page of commendation for his bravery daring and skill during the siege the only kind word he ever spoke of him i dare say all looking as though i was to take it as an especial compliment to myself and was expected to look foolish blush and say thanky for it as though i care monday night i consider myself outrageously imposed upon i am so indignant that i have spent a whole evening making faces at myself please miss sarah look natural william petitions i never saw you look cross before good reason i never had more cause however i stop in the midst of a hideous grimace and join in a game of hide the switch with the children to forget my annoyance of course a woman is at the bottom of it last night while ada and marie were here a young lady whose name i decline to reveal for the sake of the sex stopped at the door with an english officer and asked to see me in the entry i had met her once before remember this for that is the chief cause of my anger of course they were invited in but she declined saying she had but a moment and had a message to deliver to me alone so led me apart of course you know who it is from she began i told a deliberate falsehood and said no though i guessed instantly she told me the name then she had visited the prison the day before and there had met the individual whose name joined to mine has given me more trouble and annoyance during the last few months than it would be possible to mention and our entire conversation was about you she said as though to flatter my vanity immensely he told her then that he had written repeatedly to me without receiving an answer and at last had written again in which he had used some expressions which he feared had offended my reserved disposition something had made me angry for without returning letter or message to say i was not displeased i had maintained a resolute silence which had given him more pain and uneasiness than he could say that during all this time he had had no opportunity of explaining it to me and that now he begged her to tell me that he would not offend me for worlds that he admired me more than any one he had ever met that he could not help saying what he did but was distressed at offending me etc the longest explanation and she was directed to beg me to explain my silence and let him know if i was really offended and also leave no entreaty or argument untried to induce me to visit the prison he must see me as to visiting the prison i told her that was impossible o how glad i am that i never did but as to the letters told her to assure him that i had not thought of them in that light and had passed over the expressions he referred to as idle words it would be ridiculous to take offense at and that my only reason for persevering in this silence had been that brother disapproved of my writing to gentlemen and i had promised that i would not write to him that i had feared he would misconstrue my silence and had wished to explain it to him but i had no means of doing so except by breaking my promise and so had preferred leaving all explanation to time and some future opportunity but you did not mean to pain him did you the dear little creature coaxingly lisped standing on tiptoe to kiss me as she spoke i assured her that i had not he has been dangerously ill she continued apologizingly and sickness has made him more morbid and more unhappy about it than he would otherwise have been it has distressed him a great deal i felt awkwardly how was it that this girl meeting him for the first and only time in her life had contrived to learn so much that she had no right to know and appeared here as mediator between two who were strangers to her so far usurping a place she was not entitled to as to apologize to me for his sensitiveness and to entreat me to tell him he had not forfeited my esteem as though she was his most intimate friend and i a passing acquaintance failing to comprehend it i deferred it to a leisure moment to think over and in the mean time exerted myself to be affable i can't say half she spoke of but as she was going she said then will you give me permission to say as many sweet things for you as i can think of i'm going there to morrow i told her i would be afraid to give her carte blanche on such a subject but that she would really oblige me by explaining about the letters she promised and after another kiss and a few whispered words left me maybe she exaggerated though uncharitable as the supposition was it was a consolation i was unwilling to believe that any one who professed to esteem me would make me the subject of conversation with a stranger and such a conversation so my comfort was only in hoping that she had related a combination of truth and fiction and that he had not been guilty of such folly presently it grew clearer to me i must be growing in wickedness to fathom that of others i who so short a time ago disbelieved in the very existence of such a thing i remembered having heard that the young lady and her family were extremely anxious to form his acquaintance and that her cousin had coolly informed ada that she had selected him among all others and meant to have him for a beau as soon as she could be introduced to him i remembered that the young lady herself had been very anxious to discover whether the reputation common report had given me had any foundation as soon as we were alone i told mother of our conversation in the entry and said and now i am certain that this girl has made use of my name to become acquainted with him
september 1st monday i woke up this morning and to my great surprise find that summer has already passed away and that we have already entered the first month of fall where has the summer gone to since the taking of fort jackson the days have gone by like a dream i had hardly realized spring when now i find it is autumn i am content to let the time fly though as every day brings us nearer peace or something else how shockingly i write will i ever again have a desk or a table to write on at present my seat is a mattress and my knee my desk and that is about the only one i have had since the 2d of august this is the dreariest day i have seen for some time outside it has been raining since daybreak and inside no one feels especially bright or cheerful i sometimes wish mother would carry out her threat and brave the occasional shellings at baton rouge i would dare anything to be at home again i know that the yankees have left us little besides the bare house but i would be grateful for the mere shelter of the roof i often fancy how we will miss little articles that we thought necessary to our comfort before when we return and the shoes i paid five dollars for and wore a single time i am wishing i had them now that i am almost barefooted and cannot find a pair in the whole country would it not be curious if one of these days while traveling in the north if i ever travel again i should find some well loved object figuring in a strange house as a trophy of the battle of baton rouge i should have to seek for them in some very low house perhaps respectable people had very little to do with such disgraceful work i fancy suppose i should see father's cigar stand for instance or miriam's little statues i wonder if the people would have the conscience to offer to return them a young lady passing by one of the pillaged houses expressed her surprise at seeing an armoir full of women's and children's clothes being emptied and the contents tied up in sheets what can you do with such things she asked a soldier who seemed more zealous than the rest ain't i got a wife and four children in the north was the answer so we who have hardly clothes enough for our own use are stripped to supply northerners one would think that i had no theme save the wreck of our house if they read this but i take it all out in here i believe i must be made of wood or some other tough material not to feel it more i sometimes ask myself if it is because i did not care for home that i take it so quietly now but i know that is not it i was wild about it before i knew what had happened since i learned all few are the words that have escaped my lips concerning it perhaps it is because i have the satisfaction of knowing what all women crave for the worst indeed it is a consolation in such days as these when truth concerning either side is difficult to discover the certainty of anything fortune or misfortune is comfort to me i really feel sorry for the others who suffered but it does not strike me that sympathy is necessary in our case mrs flynn came to lilly's room when she heard of it well prepared for sympathy with a large handkerchief and a profusion of tears when she was horrified to find both her and miriam laughing over the latter's description of some comical scene that met her sight in one of the rooms seems to me that tears on all occasions come in as the fortieth article to the articles of belief of some people september 3d political news it would be absurd to record for our information is more than limited being frequently represented by a blank of the thirteen battles that gibbes has fought in i know the names of four only bull run stonebridge port republic and cedar run think of all i have yet to hear today comes the news of another grand affair the defeat of mcclellan pope and burnside combined if i dared believe it but accounts are too meagre as yet both gibbes and george were in it if there was a fight and perhaps jimmy too well i must wait in patience we have lost so much already that god will surely spare those three to us oh if they come again if we can meet once more what will the troubles of the last six months signify if i dared hope that next summer would bring us peace i always prophesy it just six months off but do i believe it indeed i don't know what will become of us if it is delayed much longer if we could only get home it would be another thing but boarding how long will mother's two hundred and fifty last and that is all the money she has as to the claims amounting to a small fortune she might as well burn them they will never be paid but if we get home what will we do for bedding the yankees did not leave us a single comfort and only two old bars and a pair of ragged sheets which articles are not to be replaced at any price in the confederacy so we must go without how glad i am that we gave all our blankets to our soldiers last summer so much saved from the yankees poor lavinia she fancies us comfortably settled at home i dare say she spends all her time in picturing to herself what we may be doing and recalling each piece of furniture the rooms contained wonder if she would not be shocked if the real scene were suddenly revealed to her and she should see the desolated house and see us fugitives in a strange town wonder how the cry of where are those three damned secesh women would have struck her had she heard the strange oaths and seen the eager search which followed i dare say it would have frightened her more than it did me when i was told of it william waller says it is god's mercy that we had escaped already for we certainly would have suffered i hardly think we could have been harmed though and shall always regret that we did not return immediately after the battle it took them from that day to the evacuation to finish the work and i rather think that our presence would have protected the house our servants they kindly made free and told them they must follow them the officers margret was boasting the other day of her answer i don't want to be any free er than i is now i'll stay with my mistress when tiche shrewdly remarked pshaw don't you know that if i had gone you'd have followed me the conduct of all our servants is beyond praise five thousand negroes followed their yankee brothers from the town and neighborhood but ours remained during the fight or flight rather a fleeing officer stopped to throw a musket in charles barker's hands and bade him fight for his liberty charles drew himself up saying i am only a slave but i am a secesh nigger and won't fight in such a d crew exit yankee continuing his flight down to the riverside september 4th i hear to day that the brunots have returned to baton rouge determined to await the grand finale there they and two other families alone remain with these exceptions and a few dutch and irish who cannot leave the town is perfectly deserted by all except the confederate soldiers i wish i was with them if all chance of finding lodgings here is lost and mother remains with lilly as she sometimes seems more than half inclined and miriam goes to linwood as she frequently threatens i believe i will take a notion too and go to mrs brunot i would rather be there in all the uncertainty expecting to be shelled or burnt out every hour than here ouf what a country next time i go shopping i mean to ask some clerk out of curiosity what they do sell in clinton the following is a list of a few of the articles that shopkeepers actually laugh at you if you ask for glasses flour soap starch coffee candles matches shoes combs guitar strings bird seed in short everything that i have heretofore considered as necessary to existence if any one had told me i could have lived off of cornbread a few months ago i would have been incredulous now i believe it and return an inward grace for the blessing at every mouthful i have not tasted a piece of wheatbread since i left home and shall hardly taste it again until the war is over i do not like this small burg it is very straggling and pretty but i would rather not inhabit it we are as well known here as though we carried our cards on our faces and it is peculiarly disagreeable to me to overhear myself spoken about by people i don't know as there goes miss morgan as that young man for instance remarked this morning to a crowd just as i passed it is not polite to say the least will carter was here this morning and told me he saw theodore pinckney in the streets i suppose he is on his way home and think he will be a little disappointed in not finding us at linwood as he expects and still more so to hear he passed through the very town where we were staying without knowing it beech grove september 6th saturday another perch for noah's duck where will i be in a week or two from this i shall make a mark twenty pages from here and see where i shall be when i reach it here most probably but oh if i could then be at home general carter who spent the evening with us day before yesterday remarked that the first thing he heard as he reached town was that all the gentlemen and ladies of clinton were hunting for country lodgings for us it was pretty much the case the general was as kind as ever bless his gray head and made us promise to go back to linwood with him when he passes back next week this is the way we keep the promise coming out here early yesterday morning we received a note from eliza haynes one of our indefatigable agents saying her grandmother mrs mccay had consented to receive us and would come for us in the evening immediately my packing task was begun but imagine my disappointment just as i had finished one trunk to hear mother announce her determination to let us go alone while she remained with lilly prayers entreaties tears arguments all failed and we were forced to submit so with a heart fuller than i can express i repacked the trunk with miriam's and my clothing and got ready to depart in the evening the carriage drove up to the door with eliza and her grandmother and with a hasty and rather choky good bye to lilly and mother we were hurried in and in another moment were off i fancied the house would be north of clinton so of course the horses took the road south then i decided on a white cottage to the left of the road and about two miles out found that it was to the right not painted and no cottage at all but a non descript building besides t was ever thus from childhood's hour when did i ever fancy anything exactly as it was but the appearance does not affect the house which is really very comfortable though apparently unfinished the same objection might be made to it that i made to mrs moore's for there is not a shutter on the place but fine shade trees take their place and here i do not feel the want of them so much as our room is in the back of the house to the west where the rising sun cannot salute my nose as it did at mrs moore's as to what effect the setting sun has i must wait for the evening to decide though i always enjoy that at greenwell we used to walk a mile away from home to see the sun set in an open field i find mrs mccay an excellent plain old lady with neither airs nor pretentions and very kindhearted here she lives alone with the exception of an orphan girl called jane whose position half menial half equal it would be hard to define poor girl the name of orphan alone was enough to make me sorry for her she must be friday's child she is so ready and willing eliza who it seems stays a great deal with her grandmother is one of the brightest little girls i have seen for a long while she sings and plays on the piano with a style and assurance that i can only mutely covet why cannot i have the confidence i see all others possess she took me to the gin house last evening though i could not see much as it was almost sunset when we arrived an early tea and singing and music after completed our evening and then we were shown to our room mrs mccay has only room for us two so it is fortunate that mother would not come she says she wants us to spend a few days with her to see if we like it or if we will be willing to be separated from mother in the mean time we can look around for lodgings in a larger and more comfortable place where we can be together she tells such stories about the house lilly lives in of its age and unhealthiness that i am frightened about mother she says she will die if she stays there this month miriam and eliza have gone to town to see them and are then going to mrs george's to see if she can accommodate us i wanted to have a splendid dream last night but failed it was pleasant though to dream of welcoming george and gibbes back jimmy i could not see and george was in deep mourning i dreamed of fainting when i saw him a novel sensation since i never experienced it awake but i speedily came to and insisted on his pulling henry walsh's red hair for his insolence which he promised to do instantly how absurd dreams dreams that pathetic miss sarah do you ever dream comes vividly back to me sometimes dream don't i not the dreams that he meant but royal purple dreams that de quincey could not purchase with his opium dreams that i would not forego for all the inducements that could be offered i go to sleep and pay a visit to heaven or fairyland i have white wings and with another float in rosy clouds and look down on the moving world or i have the power to raise myself in the air without wings and silently float wherever i will loving all things and feeling that god loves me i have heard paul preach to the people while i stood on a fearful rock above i have been to strange lands and great cities i have talked with people i have never beheld charlotte brontë has spent a week with me in my dreams and together we have talked of her sad life shakespeare and i have discussed his works seated tête à tête over a small table he pointed out the character of each of his heroines explaining what i could not understand when awake and closed the lecture with you have the tenderest heart i have ever read or sung of which compliment considering it as original with him rather than myself waked me up with surprise clinton september 9th tuesday back again for how long i know not at sunset saturday eliza and miriam returned to mrs mccay's with nannie davidson mother had proved obdurate and refused to leave clinton so they had all gone on and spent the day with mrs haynes instead of going to mrs george's after my quiet solitary day i was glad to see them again particularly as they brought confirmation of the great victory in virginia it is said the enemy were cut off from washington and that we were pursuing them o my brothers if god will only spare them i envy lydia who is so near them and knows all and can take care of them if they are hurt it will be several days at least before we can hear from them if we hear at all for jimmy has never yet written a line and george has written but once since the taking of the forts and that was before the battle of chickahominy we can only wait patiently perhaps general carter will bring us news mrs haynes sent a very pressing invitation for us to spend the next day with her so although it was sunday we went i am becoming dreadfully irreligious i have not been to church since mr gierlow went to europe last july it is perfectly shocking but the yankees have kept me running until all pious dispositions have been shaken out of me so they are to blame like heathens we called on miss comstock as we passed through town and spent an hour with her landed at mr haynes's we had ample time to look around before he and his wife got back from church here again i found what seems to be the prevailing style of the country widespread doors and windows with neither blinds nor shade trees to keep off the glare of the sun the dining room was a wide hall where the rising sun shone in your face at breakfast and at dinner being directly overhead seemed to shine in at both ends at once a splendid arrangement for a fire worshiper but i happened to be born in america instead of persia so fail to appreciate it september 10th yesterday i was interrupted to undertake a very important task the evening before mother and lilly happened to be in a store where two officers were buying materials for making shirts and volunteered to make them for them which offer they gladly accepted though neither party knew the other they saw that they were friends of charlie so had no scruples about offering their services the gentlemen saw that they were ladies and very kind ones besides so made no difficulty about accepting lilly undertook one of purple merino and i took a dark blue one miriam nominally helped her but her very sore finger did not allow her to do much mother slightly assisted me but i think lilly and i had the best of the task all day we worked and when evening came continued sewing by the light of these miserable home made candles even then we could not finish but had to get up early this morning as the gentlemen were to leave for port hudson at nine o'clock we finished in good time and their appearance recompensed us for our trouble lilly's was trimmed with folds of blue from mine around collar cuffs pockets and down the front band while mine was pronounced a chef d'æuvre trimmed with bias folds of tiny red and black plaid with their fresh colors and shining pearl buttons they were really very pretty we sent word that we would be happy to make as many as they chose for themselves or their friends and the eldest with many fears that it was an imposition and we were too good and much more of the same kind left another one with charlie for us we cannot do too much or even enough for our soldiers i believe that is the universal sentiment of the women of the south well but how did we get back here i hardly know it seems to me we are being swayed by some kind of destiny which impels us here or there with neither rhyme nor reason and whether we will or no such homeless aimless purposeless wandering individuals are rarely seen from one hour to another we do not know what is to become of us we talk vaguely of going home when the yankees go away when will that be one day there is not a boat in sight the next two or three stand off from shore to see what is being done ready at the first sight of warlike preparation to burn the town down it is particularly unsafe since the news from virginia when the gunboats started from bayou goula shelling the coast at random and destroying everything that was within reach report says of course we cannot return to our homes when commissioned officers are playing the part of pirates burning plundering and destroying at will with neither law nor reason donaldsonville they burned before i left baton rouge because some fool fired a shotgun at a gunboat some miles above bayou sara they burned while we were at general carter's for some equally reasonable excuse the fate of baton rouge hangs on a still more slender thread i would give worlds if it were all over at mrs haynes's we remained all night as she sent the carriage back without consulting us monday we came to town and spent the day with lilly how it was i can't say but we came to the conclusion that it was best to quit our then residence and either go back to linwood or to a mrs somebody who offered to take us as boarders we went back to mrs mccay's to tell her of our determination and in the morning took leave of her and came back home we hear so much news piece by piece that one would imagine some definite result would follow and bring us peace before long the virginia news after being so great and cheering has suddenly ceased to come no one knows the final result the last report was that we held arlington heights why not washington consequently cincinnati at last accounts lay at our mercy from covington kirby smith had sent over a demand for its surrender in two hours would it not be glorious to avenge new orleans by such a blow but since last night the telegraph is silent news has just come of some nice little affair between our militia in opelousas and the yankees from new orleans in which we gave them a good thrashing besides capturing arms prisoners and ammunition it never rains but it pours is george's favorite proverb with it comes the rumor that the yankees are preparing to evacuate the city if it could be oh if god would only send them back to their own country and leave ours in peace i wish them no greater punishment than that they may be returned to their own homes with the disgrace of their outrages here ever before their eyes that would kill an honest man i am sure sunday september 14th 1862 i have been so busy making lieutenant bourge's shirt that i have not had time to write besides having very little to write about so my industry saved my paper and spared these pages a vast amount of trash i would not let any one touch lieutenant bourge's shirt except myself and last evening when i held it up completed the loud praises it received satisfied me it would answer miriam and miss ripley declared it the prettiest ever made it is dark purple merino the bosom i tucked with pleats a quarter of an inch deep all the way up to the collar and stitched a narrow crimson silk braid up the centre to hold it in its place around the collar cuffs pockets and band down the front the red cord runs forming a charming contrast to the dark foundation indeed i devoted the sole article the yankees let fall from my two workboxes a bunch of soutache to the work large white pearl buttons completed the description and my shirt is really as quiet subdued and pretty a one as i ever saw i should first hear the opinion of the owner though if he does not agree with all the others i shall say he has no taste i got a long sweet letter from sophie on friday that made me happy for the whole day they were about leaving for alexandria i was glad to hear they would be out of danger but still i was sorry they were going so far away i have been laying a hundred wild schemes to reach baton rouge and spend a day or two with them which is impossible now sophie writes just as she talks and that means remarkably well so i can at least have the pleasure of corresponding at dr carnal's they will be out of the reach of all harm and danger so i ought to rejoice there is one thing in which sophie and i agree and that is in making stonewall jackson our hero talk of beauregard he never had my adoration but stonewall is the greatest man of the age decidedly still no authentic reports of the late battles in virginia i say late referring to those fought two weeks ago from the federal accounts glowing as they usually are i should gather the idea that their rout was complete i cannot imagine why we can hear nothing more from our own side i think my first act on my return home will be to take a cup of coffee and a piece of bread two luxuries of which i have been deprived for a long while miriam vows to devour an unheard of number of biscuits too how many articles we considered as absolutely necessary before have we now been obliged to dispense with nine months of the year i reveled in ice thought it impossible to drink water without it since last november i have tasted it but once and that once by accident and oh yes i caught some hail stones one day at linwood ice cream lemonade and sponge cake was my chief diet it was a year last july since i tasted the two first and one since i have seen the last bread i believed necessary to life vegetables senseless the former i never see and i have been forced into cultivating at least a toleration of the latter snap beans i can actually swallow sweet potatoes i really like and one day at dr nolan's i bolted a mouthful of tomatoes and afterwards kept my seat with the heroism of a martyr these are the minor trials of war if that were all if coarse distasteful food were the only inconvenience when i think of what lavinia must suffer so far from us and in such ignorance of our condition our trials seem nothing in comparison to hers and think how uneasy brother must be hearing of the battle and not knowing where we fled to for he has not heard of us for almost two months in return we are uneasy about him and sister if new orleans is attacked what will become of them with all those children tuesday september 16th yesterday miriam determined to go to linwood and consequently i had a severe task of trunk packing one of my greatest delights however i hate to see any one pack loosely or in a slovenly manner perhaps that is the reason i never let any one do it if i am able to stand this morning was appointed as our day for leaving but i persuaded her to wait until to morrow in hope that either the general or news from virginia would arrive this evening bless this village it is the meanest place for news that i ever was in not a word can be gathered except what is false or unfounded and they are even tired of that in the last few days talk of baton rouge turning yankee as the report went here of the three or four there who took the oath not one can be compared to some loyal citizens of this small burg why i talked to two gentlemen yesterday who if it were not for the disgrace and danger incurred by bearing the name i should style union men and talked or rather listened to them until my spirits were reduced to the lowest ebb people were shocked at our daring to believe there lived gentlemen and christians in the north i mean those wild fanatics who could only take in one idea at a time and rarely divested their brains of that one to make room for a newer one were shocked at our belief but if they could converse with a few here that i could point out our gnat of common sense would be swallowed by this behemoth of heterodoxy this morning mrs bar miss bernard and a miss mud came to town and surprised us by a most unexpected visit they spent the day with us and have just now driven off on their return home through this drizzly misting evening a while ago a large cavalry company passed at the corner on their way from port hudson to camp moore the report is they raised their hats to us seeing us at the gate and we waved our handkerchiefs in return each with a silent god bless you i am sure as though to prove my charge unjust news comes pouring in note we a few items to see how many will prove false first we have taken baltimore without firing a gun maryland has risen en masse to join our troops longstreet and lee are marching on washington from the rear the louisiana troops are ordered home to defend their own state thank god if it will only bring the boys back then comes tidings of nine gunboats at baton rouge ponchatoula on the railroad taken by yankees camp moore and three batteries ditto not so cheering if that is so clinton lies within reach being thirty five miles off leaving much the most valuable portion of our clothing here the yankees will probably appropriate what little they spared us and leave us fairly destitute for we take only summer clothes to linwood i have plenty of underclothes but the other day when i unpacked the large trunk from dr enders's i found i had just two dresses for winter a handsome blue silk i bought just two years ago last spring and one heavy blue merino that does not fit me what an outfit for winter miriam has two poplins and a black silk and mother a wine colored merino only but each of us is blessed with a warm cloak and are correspondingly grateful i was confident i had saved my green dark blue and brown silk dresses but the yankees saved them instead for me or their suffering sweethearts rather on the other hand taking so many necessary articles to linwood the risk of losing them is the same an attack on port hudson is apprehended and if it falls general carter's house will be decidedly unsafe from yankee vengeance the probability is that it will burn as they have been daily expecting ever since the yankees occupied baton rouge the risk seems equal either way go or stay the danger seems the same shall we go then for variety or die here of stagnation while waiting for the yankees to make up their minds i would rather be at neither place just now in fact i could hardly name the place i should like to be in now unless it were europe or the sandwich islands but i love linwood and its dear inhabitants and under other circumstances should be only too happy to be there i was regretting the other day that our life was now so monotonous almost longed for the daily alarms we had when under yankee rule in baton rouge stirring times are probably ahead linwood september 17th wednesday still floating about this morning after breakfast general carter made his appearance and in answer to his question as to whether we were ready to leave with him miriam replied yes indeed heartily glad to get away from clinton where i have detained her ever since the day theodore returned home to her great disgust as our trunk was already packed it did not take many minutes to get ready and in a little while with a protracted good bye we were on our way to the depot which we reached some time before the cars started though glad to leave clinton i was sorry to part with mother for ten days she has been unable to walk with a sore on her leg below the knee and i want to believe she will miss me while i am away i could not leave my bird in that close ill ventilated house he has never sung since i recovered him and i attribute his ill health or low spirits to that unhealthy place and thought linwood might be beneficial to him too so brought him with me to see what effect a breath of pure air might have we were the only ladies on the cars except mrs brown who got off halfway but in spite of that had a very pleasant ride as we had very agreeable company the train only stopped thirteen times in the twenty miles five times to clear the brushwood from the telegraph lines once running back a mile to pick up a passenger and so on to the great indignation of many of the passengers aboard who would occasionally cry out hello if this is the clearing up train we had better send for a hand car what the devil's the matter now until the general gravely assured them that it was an old habit of this very accommodating train which in summer time stopped whenever the passengers wished to pick blackberries on the road many soldiers were aboard on their way to port hudson to rejoin their companies one gallant one offered me a drink of water from his canteen which i accepted out of mere curiosity to see what water from such a source tasted of to my great surprise i found it tasted just like any other the general introduced a mr crawford to us who took the seat next to me as the one next to miriam was already occupied and proved a very pleasant and talkative compagnon de voyage general carter's query as to my industry since he had seen me brought my acknowledgment of having made two shirts one of which i sent yesterday who to was the next question i gave the name adding that i did not know the gentleman and he was under the impression that it was made by mother i'll see that he is undeceived cried the general hanged if i don't tell him thirtieth louisiana you say queried mr crawford that is the very one i am going to i will tell him myself so my two zealous champions went on the general ending with see to it crawford mrs morgan shall not have the credit as though there was any great merit in sewing for one's countrymen our new acquaintance handed me from the cars as we reached linwood and stood talking while the accommodating train slowly rolled out its freight he told me he was going to send me a tiny sack of coffee which proposition as it did not meet with the slightest encouragement will of course never be thought of again i noticed too on the train one of the arkansas's crew the same who though scarcely able to stand on a severely wounded foot made such a fuss about riding in a carriage while real ladies had to walk of course he did not recognize us any more than we would have known him if dr brown had not pointed him out i hear all of them are at port hudson anna told me as we got here that dr addison the one i disliked because he was so scrupulously neat while the others were dressed or rather undressed for working was here yesterday and inquired for the miss morgans saying they were the most charming young ladies he had ever met on what he founded his opinion or how he happened to inquire for us in this part of the country i cannot imagine the general brings news of the boys from jackson he there met an officer who left stonewall jackson's command on the 2d inst and says gibbes was unhurt god be praised another saw george a week ago in richmond still lame as the cap of his knee had slipped in that fall last spring of jimmy we hear not a word not even as to where he is it seems as though we are destined never to hear again september 20th saturday general carter has just received a letter from lydia which contains what to me is the most melancholy intelligence the news of the death of eugene fowler 1 who was killed on the 22d of august in some battle or skirmish in virginia poor eugene does it not seem that this war will sweep off all who are nearest and dearest as well as most worthy of life leaving only those you least care for unharmed september 21st after supper last night by way of variety anna miriam and i came up to our room and after undressing commenced popping corn and making candy in the fireplace we had scarcely commenced when three officers were announced who found their way to the house to get some supper they having very little chance of reaching clinton before morning as the cars had run off the track of course we could not appear and they brought bad luck with them for our corn would not pop and our candy burned while to add to our distress the odor of broiled chicken and hot biscuit was wafted upstairs after a while in the most provoking way in vain we sent the most pathetic appeals by each servant for a biscuit apiece after our hard work mrs carter was obdurate until tired out with our messages she at last sent us an empty jelly cup a shred of chip beef two polished drumsticks and half a biscuit divided in three with that bountiful repast we were forced to be content and go to bed at sunrise this morning mrs carter left to go down to her father in iberville to see her step mother who is expected to die scarcely had she gone when six more officers and soldiers came in from the still stationary cars to get their breakfast we heard that mr marsden too was down there so the general sent him a nice breakfast and i sent my love with it but he had already breakfasted at mr elder's as soon as they left we prepared for church and just as we were ready captain brown and mr addison were announced the doctor greeted us with an elegant bow but they did not remain long as we were about going out many officers were in church and as i passed out colonel breaux joined me and escorted miriam and me to the carriage where we stood talking some time under the trees before getting in he gave us a most pressing invitation to name a day to visit the camp that he might have the pleasure of showing us the fortifications and we said we would beg the general's permission to do so charming colonel breaux like all nice men he is married of course he and another officer drove just behind our carriage in coming home until we came to the fork of the road then leaning from their buggy both gentlemen bowed profoundly which we as cordially returned two more behind followed their example and to our great surprise ten who were seated in a small wagon drawn by two diminutive mules bowed also and not content with that rose to their feet as the distance between the two roads increased and raised their caps though in the most respectful silence rather queer and i would have said impertinent had they been any others than confederates fighting for us who of course are privileged people september 24th yesterday the general saluted us with young ladies if you will ride in a confederate carriage you may go to dress parade this evening now in present phraseology confederate means anything that is rough unfinished unfashionable or poor you hear of confederate dresses which means last year's confederate bridle means a rope halter confederate silver a tin cup or spoon confederate flour is corn meal etc in this case the confederate carriage is a jersey wagon with four seats a top of hickory slats covered with leather and the whole drawn by mules we accepted gladly partly for the ride and sight partly to show we were not ashamed of a very comfortable conveyance so with mrs badger as chaperon we went off in grand style i must say i felt rather abashed and wished myself at home as we drove into town and had the gaze of a whole regiment riveted on us but soon the men fell in line and i did not feel so painfully conspicuous i was amused at a contrast near by too there was but one carriage present besides ours though there were half a dozen ladies on horseback this carriage was a very fine one and in it sat three of the ugliest dowdiest worst dressed females i ever saw we three girls sat in our rough carriage as comfortable as could be dressed well we could not have been dressed better and looking our very best sans mentir i think the confederates were much the most respectable and what a sad sight the fourth louisiana was that was then parading men that had fought at shiloh and baton rouge were barefooted rags was their only uniform for very few possessed a complete suit and those few wore all varieties of colors and cuts hats could be seen of every style and shape from the first ever invented down to the last one purchased evidently some time since yet he who had no shoes looked as happy as he who had and he who had a cap had something to toss up that's all four or five that we knew gathered around our vehicle and talked to us mr heuston told me he heard i had been thrown severely injured had a narrow escape etc was not thrown saddle turned a few steps off we recognized mr scales he would stare very hard at us and if we turned towards him would look quickly the other way as though afraid to meet our gaze presently he gave us an opportunity and we bowed he came forward eagerly blushing deeply and looking very much pleased and shook hands with us and remained some time talking he said he had not heard of our arrival but would call as soon as possible mr talbot had joined breckinridge having seen the last of that parade he invited us to see that of his sailors which was next but it was too far so we turned off to see colonel breaux's a mile away his the thirtieth louisiana is a beautiful encampment on a large open common parade was almost over as we reached there and soon the colonel came to meet us i did not look at the drill i was watching the hundreds of tents it looked like a great many and was wondering how men could live in such places and was trying to fancy what george's or gibbes's looked like it was pleasant to watch the barefoot soldiers race around like boys let loose from school tossing caps and chips at two old gray geese that flew in circles around the encampment just as though they had never had more earnest work one gray headed man stood in the door of his tent while a black headed young one danced before him to his own whistle with his arms akimbo altogether it was a very pretty picture but poor men how can they be happy in these tents september 26th friday my mark finds me at linwood though i had not the slightest idea that it would wonder where twenty pages beyond will find me at home i hope and pray though i am as happy here as i could possibly be in any place on earth stirring news from our armies comes pouring in sunday colonel breaux told me of wool's defeat and the great number of prisoners cannon and the large supplies of stores and ammunition that we had captured then tuesday we heard of three great battles in maryland the third one still continuing but no particulars of any of them yesterday came tidings of our having recrossed the potomac and to day we hear that mcclellan's army has been cut to pieces but whether it is the same old fight or a new one i cannot as yet learn for reliable information is not easily obtained in america at this period did i ever record how little truth there was in any of that last clinton news it speaks for itself though not a boat lay at baton rouge camp moore was not even threatened ponchatoula station was burned but the one battery was retaken by our men the same night but still these false reports cannot equal the yankees take for instance the report of the captain of the essex i give general carter as my authority the captain reports having been fired on by a battery of thirty six large guns at port hudson some weeks ago when he opened fire and silenced them one after the other from the first to the last not a shot from the rebel batteries reached them and not a casualty on their side occurred but the loss of the confederates must have been awful he came within i forget how many yards from the shore and there was not a live man to be seen he did not mention if there were any dead ones now for the other side there were but four guns mounted there at the time shot and shell from those four certainly reached something for one was seen to enter a porthole from whence issued frightful shrieks soon after and it is well known that the essex is so badly injured by something as to be in a sinking condition and only kept afloat by a gunboat lashed on either side if she is uninjured why did she not return and burn natchez as she announced in leaving port hudson where not a live man was to be seen nor a dead one to be found she stopped at mr babin's just below dr nolan's where she remained the rest of the day after she left being curious to discover the reason of her short stay mr babin walked to the place where she had been and discovered sixteen fresh graves on the bank if they buried them as they did at baton rouge and vicksburg four in a grave how many would they be but granting there were but sixteen would that prove the veracity of the captain poor man perhaps he is related to pope and cannot help himself september 27th i often wonder how lies first came into the world and whether those who originate them do not believe them as firmly as any one else would believe truth lying seems to be the common creed of children and servants anna told me of having heard lennice telling the other servants that she knew there were spirits because i often talked to them every morning and evening i walked to the graveyard with a basket of flowers and would sit by father's and harry's graves and call their spirits to me and they would all fly to me and talk and sing with me for hours until i would tell them good bye and go home when they would go away too i suppose the ignorant girl having foundation enough from my frequent visits there which were most often alone made up the rest to account for my never seeming to like company out there the fervent good lord with which the tale was received by the other servants and the full credence they gave it might have proved unpleasant if further circulated and i believe some members of the family found it necessary to put an end to it at once and speaking of the graveyard recalls something i heard for the first time last night miriam was telling me that tiche had asked if we knew that mr sparks had visited harry's grave that he had got a basket of flowers from the davidsons and had made their driver carry it for him and the man had told her that after filling the vases with roses and spreading them over the grave he had thrown himself on it with a shriek of despair calling on harry to forgive him that it was only because forced by his father that he had killed him and calling on god to prove that he would give his life gladly to recall harry's the man thought him a raving maniac and fled in terror miriam asked fanny if it was true and she said yes she had gathered the flowers for him herself i saw them there but little knew whose hand had brought them i perceived at once that they were not mine and touched even to tears by so silent an offering from an unknown person i said it is some woman's work god bless the hand that laid them there i cannot say how much that little tribute affected me and mr sparks i do not retract the blessing now no god have mercy on him has been my prayer ever since i knew what an awful loss you had caused us god knows that i never even desired this revenge remorse standing over his grave it has ever been god pity and forgive never yet for an instant god pursue and avenge september 28th we were roused up at four o'clock last night by the arrival of lydia and eugene carter 1 the first from virginia and the second from tennessee and of course there was very little sleep for any of us so anxious were we to hear the news they brought first i learned that gibbes was safe up to the 17th that george in spite of the advice of his surgeon had rejoined stonewall jackson in maryland and jimmy was midshipman on the ironclad palmetto state at charleston how thankful i was to hear that much i need not say lydia said they all three looked remarkably well jimmy handsomer than ever after that news of all kinds came indiscriminately the boys were very anxious about us but had no idea of our misfortunes or whereabouts they believed us still in baton rouge and feared we had been there during the battle lydia only heard of our house having been plundered when she reached alabama so of course they are still ignorant of it they were all very homesick but said that we were their only trouble a few of the c s stories had reached them through brother officers and george swore to make himself understood by those ladies if he ever saw them again a gentleman from cooper's wells told lydia that they never tired of repeating their stories to every new arrival and no man was suffered to depart without having heard a few if a gentleman friend of ours or the boys inquired if they knew the miss morgans of baton rouge oh yes would be the answer intimately but you know they have turned yankee received federal officers every day and placed all their property under yankee protection i or my sister as it happened who was retailing the lie meaning mrs s slept in their house when it was surrounded by a yankee guard oh they are perfectly in favor of the yankees and so on think of a common low soldier who stopped for buttermilk somewhere where anna was introducing the subject it is all false anna interrupted the man answered oh miss you don't suppose we believe it we would not believe such stories of any young ladies much less these for if they are true their conduct must have been perfectly disgraceful but though we know these stories to be lies it does not prevent their being discussed in camp lydia saw mr mcg too at lynchburg who sent me his regards poor fellow he says he still has dreams he told her a few but she says they were chiefly about meeting me at a ball when i always treated him with the most freezing coldness the same old nightmare how often he has told me of that same dream that tormented him eighteen months ago he says he often thinks of me now and he still dreams of me dreams are baseless fabrics whose timbers are mere moonbeams apply your own proverb a clatter of hoofs down the road and bent over the window sill which is my desk my fingers are not presentable with the splattering of this vile pen in consequence of my position two hours yet before sundown so of course i am not dressed they come nearer still now i see them dr addison and mr m i shall not hurry my toilet for them it will take some time to comb my hair too wish i could remain up here tuesday september 30th it required very little persuasion to induce those gentlemen to stay to supper the other evening and it was quite late before they took their leave dr addison i was very much pleased with and so were all the rest mr m none of us fell desperately in love with he is too nonchalant and indifferent besides having a most peculiar pronunciation which grated harshly on my ears and that no orthography could fully express garb for instance was distorted into gairb yard into yaird airkansas and all such words that i can only imitate by a violent dislocation of my lower jaw that puts anna into convulsions of laughter only she would laugh the same if it was not funny this kentuckian pronunciation grates hairshly on my southern ears miriam addressed herself exclusively to the doctor so i was obliged to confine my attention entirely to neglected mr m in which pious duty i was ably and charitably seconded by the general speaking of the bravery and daring displayed by the southern soldiers during this war mr m mentioned the dangerous spot he had seen us in the first day we went down to the airkansas and said that iying directly across the point from the essex they expected every instant to see one of her shells explode among us and were very uneasy about our position as we did not seem to know the danger i asked him if he had observed anything peculiar among the dozen planters and overseers standing a short distance from us when the captain sent us word that our position was a very dangerous one as they expected the essex to open fire every instant and we had best stand below the levee higher up where we would be safe from shells i noticed that before any of you understood your position every man had disappeared as though by magic now i had noticed that myself when i turned under shelter of the levee our gallant planters were galloping off in the distance while ginnie and i looked and laughed we suddenly found ourselves the sole objects on the horizon the other girls were in the road below going carelessly toward the carriage so we followed having lost sight of the brave representatives of southern chivalry being the last to leave the supposed field of danger to my former remark let me add that there is only one set who take better care for their safety than married women and that set is composed exclusively of the home guard timid girls either through ignorance or fun compose the majority of the brave men that the volunteer service has not absorbed
thursday 10th september o my prophetic soul part of your forebodings are already verified and in what an unpleasant way day before yesterday an english officer not the one who came here but one totally unknown to me said at mrs peirce's he was going to visit the confederate prisoners he was asked if he knew any slightly he said but he was going this time by request he had any quantity of messages to deliver to colonel from miss sarah morgan how can that be possible since you are not acquainted with her ada demanded he had the impudence to say that the young lady i have already mentioned had requested him to deliver them for her since she found it impossible fortunately for me i have two friends left feeling the indelicacy of the thing and knowing that there must be some mistake that might lead to unpleasant consequences ada and marie my good angels insisted on hearing the messages at first he refused saying that they were entrusted to him confidentially but being assured that they were really intimate with me whereas the other was a perfect stranger and that i would certainly not object to their hearing what i could tell a gentleman he yielded fortunately for my peace of mind and told all i can't repeat it i was too horrified to hear all when they told me what struck me as being most shocking was my distorted explanation about the letters it now set forth that i was not allowed to write myself but would be happy to have him write to me then there was an earnest assurance that my feelings toward him had not changed in the least here i sprang from my chair and rushed to the window for a breath of air wringing my hands in speechless distress how a word more or less an idea omitted or added a syllable misplaced can transform a whole sentence and make what was before harmless really shocking and if it had not been for ada and marie blessed angels they entreated him not to deliver any of his messages insisting that there must be a mistake that if he knew me he would understand that it was impossible for me to have sent such a message by a stranger and although at first he declared he felt obliged to discharge the task imposed on him they finally succeeded in persuading him to relinquish the errand promising to be responsible for the consequences ah me i gasped last night making frantic grimaces in the dark and pinching myself in disgust why can't they let me alone o women women i wish he could marry all of you so you would let me alone take him please but en grâce don't disgrace me in the excitement of the race friday 25th write me down a witch a prophetess or what you will i am certainly something all has come to pass on that very disagreeable subject very much as i feared perhaps no one in my position would speak freely on the subject for that very reason i shall not hesitate to discuss it know then that this morning he went north along with many other confederate prisoners to be exchanged and he left he who has written so incessantly and so imploringly for me to visit his prison he left without seeing me bon wonder what happened evening i have learned more he has not yet left part of the mystery is unraveled only i have neither patience nor desire to seek for more these women hush to slander is too much like them be yourself my sweet little lisper informed a select circle of friends the other night when questioned that the individual had not called on me and what was more would not do so pray how do you happen to be so intimately acquainted with the affairs of two who are strangers to you asked a lady present she declined saying how she had obtained her information only asserting that it was so in fact you cannot expect any confederate gentleman to call at the house of judge morgan a professed unionist she continued so that is the story she told to keep him from seeing me she has told him that we had turned yankees all her arts would not grieve me as much as one word against brother my wrongs i can forget but one word of contempt for brother i never forgive white with passion i said to my informant will you inform the young lady that her visit will never be returned that she is requested not to repeat hers and that i decline knowing any one who dares cast the slightest reflection on the name of one who has been both father and brother to me this evening i was at a house where she was announced miriam and i bade our hostess good evening and left without speaking to her anybody but brother no one shall utter his name before me save with respect and regard this young woman's father is a captain in the yankee navy and her brother is a captain in the yankee army while three other brothers are in the confederate like herself i have three brothers fighting for the south unlike her the only brother who avows himself a unionist has too much regard for his family to take up arms against his own flesh and blood
thursday night february 16th such awful news came to us that just as the table was laid and everything ready for us to enjoy our supper father1 decided not to wait but ordered the horses to be harnessed to the carriage and we started on our fearful journey from cedar grove 2 not even taking time to carry anything with us our terror on the road imagining we heard the yankees guns across the

near bonneau's yesterday noon four or five in number did nothing but carry off mr harvey's saddle and bridle before leaving they called up the negroes and told them they were free consequently none would go to work this morning father heard this from mr harvey whom he met at pooshee where all the men left in the neighborhood met to decide what to do to save their property from yankee spoliation they had quite a fright a squad of cavalry were seen coming up the avenue which were taken for yankees but were discovered to be our own men under lieut bright of edgefield detached by gen samuel w ferguson to come down to worry the enemy and suppress disorder among the negroes poor old mr cain started for home on the first alarm working his way around to stop here and let us know father was a prisoner father having come home the direct road had told us all the news before the old man's arrival the enemy penetrated as far as black oak last night where they took prisoner one of our poor soldiers who had stopped at the myers for supper they returned as they came through wantoot the negroes say the house there very much injured i hear mrs catherine white behaved very bravely but old mrs brunson who lived with her said so much the yankees threatened to put her head through the window and shoot it off mrs white wrote and begged mr lewis simons who lived near to come to her aid he could not leave his family but invited general potter sic to dinner told him what his men were doing potter instantly sent an order for them to desist what i most fear is not the yankees but the negroes cut off from all help from across the river and at their mercy what will become of us disorder has already started aunt nenna's people have all returned to their work except edward the leader i firmly believe bram returned this morning but when aunt nenna sent him word to come to his weaving his answer was he wouldn't that he was cutting wood when she sent word he must come he decamped and

ash wednesday march 1st a gloomy uncomfortable day no church to go to in constant dread of a yankee invasion a skirmish at harbin last night our little squad of cavalry under bright was there a negro brought the yankees from pineville and piloted them to where our men were camped taking them completely by surprise capturing bright and killing two of his men another mortally wounded died this morning all we can learn of the skirmish the yankees fired at the back door some of the balls entering cousin jane's room one hitting the post of bedstead where her baby was sleeping she picked her up in her arms and rushed to the door appealing to the captain a rumor tonight cousin rene a prisoner monday 2nd march a most exciting day this morning a pooshee negro came over the black yankees four in number had been at pooshee last night had threatened to shoot old uncle2 if he didn't tell where the brandy was hid took all the meat from the smoke house hear they had been to cousin william's3 in morning just after dinner a squad of yankee cavalry rode up to ask for wine the captain hartwell was very polite they went off to chelsea but soon returned then while the officer was in the parlor talking the men were busy at the back of the house going through the closets the safe the dairy and the kitchen taking whatever they could find in the way of eatables have literally left us nothing for supper one stayed behind and carried of charles's colt flavella these yankees have pockets half the length of their legs and there is no telling what they contrive to stuff into them friday march 3rd a most exciting night of horror while i was writing yesterday afternoon another squad of three yankees rode up in search of saddles and bridles they were very rude said we might as well tell where things were and save their rummaging and then rode off aunt nenna having found some cold waffles actually left we were quickly seated enjoying our supper thinking our trials over for the day when we heard many heavy steps in the entry a rough knock at the door a rude voice how are you this evening i say how are you this evening the open door revealed the entry full of negro yankees armed to the teeth and all drunk enough to do mischief mother who is in constant dread of rene's being seized on account of his age altho so small motioned him into the back room aunt nenna's chamber where the children had all run to hide the negro sergeant a coal black giant of six feet immediately demanded what the boy was after and called him back aunt nenna with much presence of mind went to the door and brought out charles stevens the sergeant was very insulting in his language he demanded all fire arms which were given him then he wanted wine said he had been told we had some and would get it out of father called for a rope and ordered a squad of men to carry him and string him up if he would not give up the liquor mother threw herself on her knees pleading for father's life the wretch spurned her with his foot and told her to behave herself like a woman and he would treat her like one mother was so overcome we had to get her into aunt nenna's room one of the men came to the door and told me speak to the lady and make yourselves satisfied he wouldn't let father be hurt with this small comfort i went to mother to add to our troubles mother remembered a phial of brandy up stairs saved for father's use if the wretches found it what would become of us mother could not move the children were clinging to her the difficulties of the way a long black entry full of drunken devils then another entry above full of unknown horrors we waited until most of the yankees had left the house liz 1 offered to go with me holding on to each other we treaded on our way scarcely daring to think we reached the room safely rose washington 2 who had been faithful followed us the guard were all around the house we were afraid to throw the phial out when we got it rose proposed breaking it in a bucket of water and carrying the bucket down on her head she did her part well badgering the men she met and answering their questions i followed with liz so grateful when we got to mother i can't tell the words and doings of the devils but soon after we got back our friend came to the door to say father was all right none of us had sense to do the right thing but poor little liz who stepped up and shook the man's hand thanking him the men had all the meat and salt collected and brought into the entry and the captain distributed it to the negroes we have some idea of hell now such obscene language and ribald oaths filling our ears for the better part of the night when at last near daybreak they all left the house they demanded sugar and coffee to make a supper at the black overseer's jimmy you may imagine there was no sleep even then for us we waited their return a mattress had been thrown down in the middle of the room for the children the men threatened to kill william1 if he did not tell them where the liquor was buried tommie and jacob2 were carried to hanover to show them where it was hid aunt nenna's people with few exceptions have behaved shamefully

to the children we are not yankees but rebs some of our own scouts under dennis and mctureous we were so uneasy for fear the vandals would meet them so anxious for their safety we could not enjoy the pleasure of seeing our own men again they came to the negroes ordering they to go to work monday c young dennis is very pleasant looking and mctureous is very good looking indeed they left us to scout around indianfield to find if the yankee story is true i think the negroes must have been disappointed as they passed back soon after the scouts left us sunday 19th march mr mitchum stopped here his

hear the oath has been offered to the cooper river planters some have taken it those who refused nothing has been done to them as yet we are kept so distracted rumors of all kinds some for and some

stay here has been truly delightful tonight we sat late in the piazza everything so lovely i forgot there was war and bloodshed all around us saturday april 8 thank god willie has gone father and mother spent yesterday with him at cedar grove sending him on in the afternoon to the rocks 1 for the night last night a squad of eight men rode up saying they were our scouts that the yankees had almost surrounded them at somerset 2 you may guess our terror altho father and aunt nenna were firmly persuaded they were yankees spying out the land it is customary for folks to entertain the scouts aunt nenna never even offered them a drink of water the captain actually got off his horse and told father to listen and we would hear the drums beating at somerset i was listening for the drum all night moved downstairs again hardly closing my eyes this morning was grateful for one thing willie was safe i could think of little else i don't think father really believed the enemy were near until at breakfast table looking out the window we saw two pillars of smoke rising from the direction of somerset it was mill day the engine in full blast and all our remaining stock in the way of mules wagons c were assembled around the door father wished to order harry who had just driven in from cedar grove with the only horse left us to turn back but it was too late from up the avenue and across the fields came two squads of bluecoats at a mad gallop like a very whirl wind and before we could think the yankees were on us riding around the house some to the stables some to the mill they scoured the place and the house taking all the harness except some belonging to the old buggy they took grist and poultry shooting down the latter about the yard richie white was with us he was very much freightened i had gathered all the children in my room upstairs every time i would go near the window he would implore me to come back some of these wretches had prepared themselves for plunder having their pants pockets below their knees they carried off all wagons mules and carts cleaned the store room of all hams c we had hidden knocked down all the geese they could our red faced friend who has been on every raid was here again and distinguished himself in the pilfering line took a box with uncle henry's letters his buggy blanket was next seized and finished off by pocketing willie's flute which would do to blow along the road he said the officer came upstairs making noise enough to scare all the children as he had on not only his own sword and spurs but uncle henry's dragging behind him mother had all father's clothes in a trunk in the entry but he passed that by going into mother's room noticed father's tin box of papers then to the press mother trembled as the silver we were using was all hidden in her dresses but finding no man's clothes with some most contemptuous expression about her using the poor old man so badly having so much more clothes he left only stopping at my room door not coming in one of the men rushed up before leaving and carried off the blanket from the boys bed the provost marshal tried to make father take the oath when he refused cursed him and told mother the men were all fools but he was sorry for the woman the wretches actually carried off a towel that was hanging on the railing to dry after they had gone mother missed laura such stories of yankees carrying off little ones our hearts sank we sent to the negro yard hoping she may have strayed to mauma's house but no one had seen her ah the sorrow for us so helpless nothing to do but try and comfort mother aunt nenna's room once had a window on the piazza when the shed room was added it was boarded up the high bedstead with its curtains was put against it the brick wall being thick the recess of the window made a splendid hiding place for valuables from the yankees mother was sitting weeping by the fire place when she heard a faint voice dem yankee gone yet she thought at first she was dreaming when the question was repeated soon sorrow was turned into joy she had wandered from her haven of refuge in my room to find mother failing to do so she had crept into a good place to hide and worn out with terror and weeping had fallen asleep hear the yankees are en route for pineville where they say they are going to give the people hell sunday april 9th here's what the yankees did at pooshee heard from cousin hennie this morning the yankees took some of their silver and all of uncle's clothes dr waring has just been here cousin william 1 and cousin rene both prisoners the former right sick edith and mary waring were driving leize edwards home to stewarton when they met the yankees who took them prisoner carrying them along almost to woodlawn then on edith's persistent pleadings after taking their fine horse from them they sent them off with an old balky animal that could hardly drag them home we find out father was saved from taking the oath by the testimony of one of the enemy who had served as a clerk when a boy in a corner shop near george st judy 1 recognized him brought him up and made him give testimony that he knew father lived in the city and was only a refugee as he said eugenia and judy have been faithful through everything monday april 10 another anxious night of watching a note from anna cain the yankee army had camped in somerset yard burning all fences cutting down the beautiful shrubbery in the gardens to build their boothes killed every head of poultry except a few turkeys that escaped took all the meat from the store room except a few pieces worse than all burnt down the provision barn with all the corn and peas c the most of anna's news is that a fresh party is coming up from lewisfield chance who brought the note says he met some blue coats on the way but did not know if they were yankees or scouts dress up dr waring was telling us the night the yankees were at hog swamp they took mrs dehay out in the woods and tried to make her betray the scouts hiding place in the swamp none of their threats or bribes had any effect they even told her if she did not tell where dennis and his men were they would burn her house down she says her blood was up she told them they could do what they pleased that southern women would live under the green trees rather than betray their friends wednesday 26th april
