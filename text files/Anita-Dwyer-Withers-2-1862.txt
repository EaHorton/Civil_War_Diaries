Saturday 1st of February. [1862]
        It rained all day nearly. I took my Music lesson. Mrs. Stuart finished my collar for me.
Sunday 2ond. [Feb. 1862]
        I went to Church at 11 O'clock, heard an excellent sermon, from there
we went home with Mrs. John Purcell--and dined. We returned home about 4, layed down-- After Tea we sat in the parlour.
Monday 3rd. [Feb. 1862]
        It snowed all morning. I sent for Dr. Dean to see me, he said I was getting along very well. In the morning I suffered with pain in my teeth--neuralgia, I suppose.
Tuesday 4th. [Feb. 1862]
        I still suffer with the pain in my face. The Captain sent me some lager beer & nuts.
Sunday 9th. February. [1862]
        I was taken sick, had high fever all night, and continued to have it for a week. I had a terrible attack of pneumonia and a miscarriage. I layed dangerously ill for several days. Dr. Dean felt very uneasy about me. My dear Husband nursed me tenderly through my sickness. One evening we talked about Religion, he promised me seriously he would try and become a member of the Catholic Church. Mrs. Duval and Mrs. Stuart were extremely kind to me. They used to dress my blisters & poultices. Mrs. Wootten, another kind friend, arranged my hair for me every morning for a week. All my other friends outside were exceedingly kind to me also in coming to see me, and sending me nice things to tempt my appetite.
        Cousin Jeannie & Clement arrived here on the evening of the 18th. of Feb. The day the permanent Congress met. I was still confined to my bed
when they came. Cousin Lawson was also in the city for a few days, on his to Knoxville, Tenn.
