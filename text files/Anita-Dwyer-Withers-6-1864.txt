June 20th. [1864]
        The Capt. came up to see us--having been sick he succeeded in getting a Furlough for six weeks.
June 25th. Saturday. [1864]
        The Capt. had not been with me many days when he an Mr. Russell had to go down to Roanoke bridge to defend it. The Yankees having made a raid advanced in large force to take it. The Capt. remained with the men during the fight, they repulsed the Yankees handsomely.
        The Enemy came within ten or eleven miles of Mr. Russell's place. A great many of the neighbours went on the other side of the river for safety. We were not much alarmed.
        The gentlemen returned on Sunday 26th all safe and sound. I felt uneasy about them although I never dreamed that they had an engagement. We have had intensely hot weather.
