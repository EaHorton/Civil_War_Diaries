May 1st. 1862.
        Thursday, the Captain left for Richmond this evening. I don't believe I can go to Texas if New Orleans is surrendered.
        The Capt. telegraphed to me on Sunday, June 1st. to go to Rich-- by first opportunity.
        My friends advise me not to leave until we hear of the result of the battle. I feel very anxious about my Husband.
        Capt. Myers is also in Richmond.

Salisbury.
        The battle near Richmond commenced today--as far as we have heard they have continued fighting for three days.
