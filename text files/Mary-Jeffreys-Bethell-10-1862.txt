October 1st
        I have been tryed and tempted, and cast down for many days, troubled about many things, no joy. This is a world of tribulation. I feel some better this evening. I believe the Lord will bless me, but I am sinful and don't deserve it, he is able to save me out of all my troubles, for many days I have been in trouble, cast down, tempted and perplexed.

        The Lord has removed my trouble and blessed me. I have just returned home from Wentworth, I attended brother Pepper's meeting. I was there six days, and saw one of the greatest revivals I have seen in two years, it was a time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord. There were about 40 converts, 23 joined the Church. I did enjoy it, my soul was made happy, I felt like it was good to be there, it was what I had been praying for, what I had desired to see. It was a feast to my soul, thank the Lord, I will praise him as long as I live, and shall praise him in heaven, I hope. I have peace and comfort in my soul tonight, hallelujah!! Praise the Lord!
        We have received a letter from our dear George, he was well, he is about Wilkesboro.

        George has come home to spend a few days, he is well and hearty, the Lord has blessed him. I must now record the goodness of God. We have just received a letter from Mr. Williamson, our son in law, he is on his way here with his negroes, he will go back after our daughter and bring her here in a few days. I pray that she may get here safe. I will praise the Lord with joyful lips.
