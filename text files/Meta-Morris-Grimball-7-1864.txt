        Mr Grimball received a letter from William written from the 3d N.C. Hospital, Charlotte Street, Charleston, telling him he was there ill, & at the end of the letter said there was such a buzzing in his head from Quinine he could hardly write, he had received the stockings sent down, & had a pair on, was thankful for them. Arthur wrote the next day, & Berkley Wilkins, both saying William was very ill. Arthur sent a telegram begging his Papa to come down at once, Mr Grimball set off on Monday, arrived in Charleston about 5 o'clock on Tuesday 25[?] . William knew him but when he spoke wandered. Arthur met his father at the cars, Berkley was at the Hospital. Mr Grimball passed the night there & at about 7 o'clock on Wednesday morning William passed away, apparently without pain, his father closing his eyes. He was placed in the Wilkin's vault, temporarily, on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, Mr Gadsden performing the Service, having visited and prayed for William, on Tuesday afternoon before Mr G arrived, Ham was with him Dr Geddings attended, and he had a room to himself, and was as comfortable as possible.
       It has pleased Almighty God to take from us this good, affectionate, and gifted child, just when the promise of his youth and care, he took with himself to train and prepare himself for his profession might have yeilded some fruit. He was handsome, elegant, & cultivated in his manners & so much interested in his family, the letters I have from him always allude to them,
& propose some benefit for them. I believe him among the saved in Heaven: his fever was the consequence of the exposure on the Coast, while attending to his duties, he was 1st Lieutenant 1st S.C. Artilery . My God give me Resignation to thy will, and lift up my poor, sinful heart to trust, & to pray always. -
