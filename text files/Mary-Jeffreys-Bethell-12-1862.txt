        This is Christmas day, a most lovely day for the season, it is almost like Spring. I hope 'tis a token of good, that the Lord is going to bless us if it is his will. I hope the war will soon close and that we may have peace. I feel today that the Lord is good, my soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Saviour. I feel peace and comfort, the Lord is mine, he hath done great things for me, I will praise him.
        I heard yesterday of the death of Mr. William McCain, one more saint entered heaven. He was a devoted christian. I had the pleasure of forming his acquaintance about 2 years ago. My faith in God is strengthened, I enjoy more religion than I ever did in my life, I feel that I am getting nearer my heavenly Home.
