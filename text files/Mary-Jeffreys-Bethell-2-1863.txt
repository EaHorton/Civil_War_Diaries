Feby 12
        I felt so thankful to hear that Robt. Watt professed religion before he died Jan. 26. Brother Pepper was to see me last Saturday, we had a profitable and pleasant conversation on the subject of religion, I have felt better ever since. I had been tempted and sad for several weeks, but the darkness is gone, I have light, strength and comfort, thank the Lord. Feb. 4th I went to Union Sunday to hear brother Pepper, he preached a good sermon, his text was found in the 4th Chap Hebrews, 16 verse, he held class meeting, I felt happy and enjoyed religion.
        My husband has been trying many years to sell out and move South. I prayed to the Lord to prevent it, the Lord heard and answered me, my husband has abandoned the idea of going. I thank the Lord for it.
        This is a beautiful day, the Lord is good. I feel cheerful and happy. I will praise the Lord for his goodness to me and mine, we have every comfort and blessing to enjoy.
