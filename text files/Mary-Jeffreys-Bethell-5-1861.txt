May 9th
        This is a solemn day to me, my dear son Willy told us farewell this morning. The Governor of our state sent for 2 companys of soldiers to go to Weldon. I feel very sad in parting with my precious child, I may never see him again, but I commit him into the hands of my kind Saviour. I look to God for help in this great trial, I believe he will comfort me with his grace. I have faith to believe that he will help my son.

        All day after my dear son Willy left my soul was overwhelmed with sorrow, my heart seemed almost to bleed. I prayed to God to comfort me, and he heard and answered, he did comfort me and give me faith to believe that he would bless my son, glory! and honor! and praise to his name forever! He is my refuge in the day of trouble, he is my best friend, I will love him and praise him as long as I live. I think of Willy every day, but I do not sorrow and grieve for him, because God comforts my heart, and has taken away sorrow from my heart. The Lord has said ask and ye shall receive. I do ask him to convert all of my children, and that his kingdom may come, his will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
        I am looking for my dear George to come home, I do pray that God may bring him safely home to my arms.

        The Lord has heard my prayer, and brought my dear George safely home, he arrived here this evening. I will praise God for his goodness to me in these trying times. I am so glad to see my dear son, he has been sick, is fallen off. I hope God will convert his soul, he is my first born son, named after his grandpa who prayed many prayers for him. I feel sad when I think about my dear George who will soon have to leave us, perhaps to join the army. I hope God will direct us and make everything work for our spiritual good. I hope God will bless my absent daughter Mrs. Williamson and bring her back to North Carolina. I hope she will remain with me until the war is over.
