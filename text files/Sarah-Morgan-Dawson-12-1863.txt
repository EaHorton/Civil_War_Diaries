Thursday night, December 31st, 1863.
        The last of eighteen sixty-three is passing away as I write. . . . Every New Year since I was in my teens, I have sought a quiet spot where I could whisper to myself Tennyson's "Death of the Old Year," and even this bitter cold night I steal into my freezing, tireless little room, en robe de nuit, to keep up my old habit while the others sleep.

                       "Old year, you shall not die;
                       We did so laugh and cry with you,
                       I've half a mind to die with you,
                       Old year, if you must die."
        No! Go and welcome! Bring Peace and brighter days, O dawning New Year. Die, faster and faster, Old One; I count your remaining moments with almost savage glee.
