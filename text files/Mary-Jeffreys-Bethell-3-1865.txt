        My dear Willie got home safe a week ago, he has a furlough, 'till the 15 of this month, he is in very fine health I am thankful to God for his goodness. I have been sick for several days, I am better now. I am frail and delicate, I think my lungs are weak. I have a weakness when I take much exercise, I feel that though outward man may perish, I trust the inward man is renewed day by day, sometimes death and the grave seems near. I am familiar with the thought, but I feel so humble, I am unworthy and unprofitable, but I am looking to God, I have faith in him, and because he has been with me in all my troubles I can trust him forever, my soul doth bless his holy name, praise ye the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever. I am praying to God every day to bring George and Weldon home to our embrace.
        Last Monday I attended the burial of Joseph Dicks, our neighbor, he professed religion before he died, he was a soldier, came home sick and died at home after an illness of several months.
        This is a dark hour for our country, the enemy are still advancing, taking possession of our citys and destroying property, thousands of our men have been slain. The war has been going on nearly four years, it is thought that slavery will be abolished, the enemy have been victorious.

        I sit down to record the goodness of God. My dear son George has got home safe to our embrace, he was a prisoner near two years. I continued to pray for him, the Lord has heard and answered, glory and honor and power and might be unto our God, forever and ever.
