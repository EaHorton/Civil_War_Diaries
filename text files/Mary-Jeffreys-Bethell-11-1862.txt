        Mr. Williamson reached here safe on Saturday the 25 with his servants, he left Mary Virginia and the children well. They were staying with Mrs. Jones, six miles from their home. Thank the Lord I have heard from my daughter, she and the 2 children are well. This another evidence of the goodness of God.
        Mr. Williamson returns from Arkansa today and I hope will bring M. Virginia back with him in a few weeks. I feel more cheerful, I have had peace and comfort ever since the meeting at Wentworth 4 weeks ago. The Lord is good to me and mine.
        We received another letter from George this week, he was well. My family enjoy good health, all the servants. Some of Mr. Williamson's servants have the chills, contracted at Arkansa.
        The Lord is reviving his work at several places on our circuit under Brother Pepper, about 70 converts.

        I heard last night of the death of Tomy Torian, I hope he was prepared, he professed religion when quite young, while at my house, he lived several years with me, after his Father died. I hope I was instrumental in his conversion. I gave him religious instruction with the other children. Tomy was about 11 years old when he professed. I hope he is in heaven. I pray for all the children, William, Jinny, Sally, and Lou, I pray that God may make them happy christians, that I may meet them in heaven.
