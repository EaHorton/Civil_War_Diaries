1 January 1864
        Mr Grimball was prevented from going to Town by the weather & I am glad he remained for we have always been together on New Year's day. We are expecting a visit from Lewis on his way to the Western Army. - I thank God for all his mercies and pray to increase in faith & love & charity. - The travelling now is attended with so much risk that I shall feel unhappy until Mr Grimball returns. -
       The Kenedies have said the most complimentary things about William. Mrs K the day after the girls & W. took tea there, sent a message that she was sorry she had not been able to come in the room & make the acquaintance of Mr Grimball she heard he was such a fine young man. -
