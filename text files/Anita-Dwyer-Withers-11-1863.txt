Sunday, November 1st. 1863.
        Feast of All Saints. A beautiful day. The Capt. is going out to the country to Mr. Grant's to spend the day.
        We bought a servant yesterday, I trust she may suit us. Susan seems to be a good natured women, and says she is only eighteen--
        I had several letters from home a few days ago, they were all well there.
        Johnny is a fine healthy little boy--the poor little fellow will have to part with his nurse Louisa--
Nov. 28th. [1863]
        Susan seems to get along pretty well. Johnny knows her already. I have had one of my dreadful sick headaches lately, I feel very weak from it.
        I have Just been around to call on Mrs. Semmes who is our neighbor.
Mrs. & Captain Myers came from Salisbury to stay with us on 19th. December. We had a very pleasant time together, going every day.
        On Christmas day Col. Williams & his family, Capt. Wade & Capt. Myers & wife dined with us. We had a mighty nice dinner--cake, Jelly, Blanc Mange and many nice things.
        The gentlemen gave several parties. My Husband was invited to Mr. Grant's, Maury's and Dr. Cabell's.
        Capt. and Mrs. Myers left us on the 4th. January, they hated to leave us and Richmond.
