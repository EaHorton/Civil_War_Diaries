        The weather is very cold now, we have had a great deal of rain, the roads are very bad. I don't think there will be any more battles until spring, the rainy weather, bad roads, prevent travelling. The North have sent out a large fleet of 125 vessels to attack us on the coast, commanded by Capt. Bernside. I hope the Lord will be with us, and save us from our enemys. I expect we will have a good deal of trouble in various ways, and have to humble ourselves under God's hand before this war terminates. I thank God for his goodness to my family, we have been blessed. I feel today determined to love God, and keep his commandment. I have comfort and sweet peace in my Saviour, he is mine and I am his.
        I feel concerned about my daughter Mrs. Williamson she expects to be confined next month. I would like to be with her in that trying time, she is in Ark. I do not know whether she will come here or not, I do not know that I can get out there, but I will commit it all in the hands of my merciful Saviour, I hope he will direct. I pray that he will be with my daughter and give her a safe delivery, and that she may do well. I have faith in God, I believe she will do well.
        I hope and pray that my two, George and Willie, may get home safe and in good health in the Spring if the Lord permits.

        This is a gloomy time, we have not heard from our daughter in Ark. in several weeks, we feel very anxious about her. I commit her to the hands of my Heavenly Father, I believe she is safe.
        My boys can't come home this week as they expected, they are expecting an attack from the Enemy. I feel concerned about my dear boys, I do not know but they may be killed or wounded.
        The Enemy are getting the advantage of us. They have taken Roanoke island and 2,000 of our men prisoners. They have possession of Fort Domelson in Tennessee, 'tis said our Forces have evacuated Nashville.
