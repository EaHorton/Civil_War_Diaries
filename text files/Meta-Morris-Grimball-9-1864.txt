        Received letters from Lewis near Atlanta in the trenches. He was overwhelmed with distress at the death of his brother & says he has been confirmed & joined the Church. Bishop Ley is with the Army, Lewis has for some time been seriously impressed & then wavered before he joined the Church. This war has had a very chastening influence on the young men, and his brothers death no doubt assisted the feeling. I am truly thankful for the mercy.

        My mind is constantly dwelling on William's life, his earnest, serious manner when a very little child, we were all riding together & the other boys made so much noise that W. knelt down and said his prayers, which surprised them so much they became quiet. - One day he said to me "Ma don't die for if you die I will die too & then if you die I will go to Heaven to look for you." He said his chatechism when he was going to
college, to keep Arthur quiet. - When quite grown up he put Harry to bed for two months as H wished it. - Miss Smith said he had the most reverent manner in Church, I cannot think that with such a nature Religion being long "felt a comfort" as he wrote to me, was lightly understood. He must have taken it lovingly, into his soul. Mr Grimball often says he thinks he was not treated judiciously, & in that way met his death, but I try to think it was God's will to take him from us, & this passing world. - When his papers came up there was a letter from William to his father, the last he wrote, saying that might be the last of him, & if it was not for the expense he wished him to come & then said come, come, it almost broke Mr Grimball's heart, but he could not have got there sooner than he did, & then he just recognized him. - Oh my dear, dear child, how I think of you, and all your unselfish, thoughtful ways; I believe I was always kind to him, I know I meant to be. -
