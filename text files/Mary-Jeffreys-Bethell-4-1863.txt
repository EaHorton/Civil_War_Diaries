        My dear George returned home safe two weeks ago, he is in fine health, this is another evidence of the goodness of God. I will praise him. I now consecrate myself to him, I am his, and he is mine, I want to do his will as it is done in Heaven. I want to be a submissive child, and when I'm called to suffer to be patient, and resigned. My soul is happy, praise ye the Lord!!
        I went to Union Sunday to hear brother Pepper preach, we had a good time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, bro Pepper held class meeting, several got happy, I was happy too, thank the Lord.

        This is fine weather. My dear son George left us for the army last Thursday the 16th of the month. I felt so sad on parting with him, but I commit him to the Lord. I beg the Lord to convert his soul, and protect and shield him from all harm. The Lord has comforted me, I thank and praise his holy name.
