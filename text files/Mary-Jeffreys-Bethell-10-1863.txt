October 7th
        We received a letter from our dear George, he is at Johnson's Island, he wrote that he was getting well. I do thank the Lord for taking care of George. No tidings from my dear Mary Virginia and Willie. I beg the Lord to bring me a letter from them very soon.
        My health is feeble, I have fallen off, was very sick Sunday night with pain in my stomach and bowels, indigestion. I have been living on milk and mush. I pray the Lord to spare me to see my dear George, Willy, and Mary Virginia come home. The waves of trouble nearly go over me, I am in trouble and distress, but I will look to God and call on him to have mercy upon me, and comfort my poor sorrowful soul. I have often thought that I would trust in God as long as I live, and in every extremity, yes I do trust in him, and I believe he will come to my help.

        Last Thursday the Lord comforted my soul with sweet peace in my soul, and on Saturday the long wished for letter came from my daughter in Arkansa, she wrote that they were all tolerable well, and Willie too. I feel thankful to my Saviour, my soul is happy, it was so refreshing to hear from them. On Sunday our meeting commenced at Union, 3 miles from here, it closed Thursday, it was a time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord. 19 souls converted. 1 hope 5 joined the Church. The christians were made happy, my dear Robert professed religion on Wednesday 21st October 1863, during this meeting. Oh how thankful I feel, what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits, hallelujah praise ye the Lord.
