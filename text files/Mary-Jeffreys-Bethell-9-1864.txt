Sept. 25
        Since I last wrote I have had a happy time. My sweet daughter Mary Virginia joined the Methodist church Saturday of the fourth Sunday in August, bro. Gannon baptized her.
        Cousin Lizzie Graves from Georgia has spent three weeks with me, she is my dear cousin by my Mother's side, she is a lovely christian, we have had some delightful fellowship with each other in talking about God and his love to us.
