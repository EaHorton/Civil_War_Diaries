October 1st. Thursday. [1863]
        We hired a girl that belonged to Col. Garnett to nurse Johnnie, Louisa is just from the country and seems to be a good servant--We have had a
great deal of trouble with servants, I have been worried to death--
October 3rd. Saturday. [1863]
        We moved to Mrs. Nelson's--we are elegantly fixed--better off than we ever have been in Richmond, in every respect. We occupy the whole of the third floor.
        Mr. Menard was married on Monday 5th.--Capt. attended his wedding.
        We have just received a box from sister with some wine and other little things--
        Mr. Buxton, I understand, has been arrested.
Saturday 17th. [October, 1863]
        Mrs. Williams went up to Dr. Wayt's farm this morning.
        We are very pleasantly fixed at Mrs. Nelson's. I went around to Mrs. Duval's and saw them all there. I took little Johnny there, nicely dressed, they all made a great fuss over him.
        In the evening we went to Mr. Greenhow's.
        There is a report that they are fighting up in the army.
Sunday, October 18th. [1863]
        I have just returned from Church. The Capt. I believe has gone to the country with Mr. Grant. A great many rumours on the street, the Militia is going up to Western Virginia.
        I have not heard from my home for months.
October 23rd. Friday. [1863]
        Rather pleasant. I received three letters from home, one from Maria-- all well. Joe has a boy named Edward, Concion one called Eugene. Grand doings at home--I wish I was at home. I feel very homesick.
        Mrs. Williams child Tom was christianed today--she had several friends around there.
        Mrs. Dangerfield finished my light poplin today--it wants altering very much. Dear little Johnny was sick yesterday, but better today--he has taken cold.
