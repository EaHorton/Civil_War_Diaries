July 29th
        There has been a great deal of sickness in my neighborhood. I have been visiting the sick, and I carry them something nice to eat, lightbread and rice. I love to visit the sick because God has commanded us to do it. I have been to Mrs. Griffith's, four of her family down sick with bloody flux, while I was there Sally Ann died, and I assisted in shrouding her. Lizzy died on Monday, Sally Ann on the day before. May the Lord bless that afflicted family. Old Mr. DeJarnette died last Saturday, I am sorry for his daughters left by themselves. May the Lord take care of them.
        We have had an overflow from the river, we will lose half our crop of corn.
        There has been a battle at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, great many killed on our side, we heard that Julius Ferguson, N. Strader were killed, Charlie Watkins lost his leg, Peter Scales died from his wounds. Green Daniel slightly wounded and a prisoner, my dear son George was taken prisoner. I thank my Saviour that it was no worse, I pray that God may save his life and grant that this trial may be the means of making him a christian. Man's extremity is God's opportunity, 'tis my daily prayer that God may convert his soul. I have examined my heart and I find that I do love God, and believe that I am his child, and he is my Father. I delight in doing the will of God. I take great pleasure in reading my bible and in secret prayer, but after I have done all that is commanded, I feel that I am an unprofitable servant, and only done my duty, I deserve nothing, and I have nothing but what I have received from God. I have peace and comfort, I rejoice in the Lord, my soul is happy, hallelujah. I will praise the Lord for his wonderful goodness to me and mine, I have faith to believe that God will bless all my children. I want to be kept humble and resigned to my Father's will.
