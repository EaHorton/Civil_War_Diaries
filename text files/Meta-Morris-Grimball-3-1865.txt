6th March 1865
        I have no heart to write a journal now. The war goes on but so much distress and suffering. Charleston evacuated, Columbia sacked & burned, Cheraw[?] , Winnsborough, Camden, Society Hill & other places visited by the Army of Sherman & sacked and burned. Our Army now under Johnston following Sherman and all things in gloom & trouble. Arthur & Berkley are with the troops from the Coast in Raleigh & Hillsborough. Lewis was with us for 10 days, looking quite well, he is now with the Army in North Carolina. Harry received an appointment from the Gov, for the Arsenal, & to day left us for Greenville where they are to be located. This has been a great trial to me for he is the youngest and not yet sixteen. I fear all the fatigue & hardship he will not be able to stand; and my heart yearns over this child. He left a very good school for this appointment and they have no books to educate the Cadets. - My only comfort is in prayer.
       Gabriella & Charlotte have a nice little School of 7 scholars, there were 8 but one has left not being able to get board. - Gabriella teaches 3 girls Music she gets $35 per Month for the School & $20 for the Music. -
       The mails are all broken up Couriers take letters round. Elizabeth is rich she came up to see Lewis. - This is near the end of September, and since May -
