June 4th
        I have been cast down some time, I have had severe and fiery trials, and temptations. The Lord's face seems hid from me. I felt very gloomy, the waves of sorrow almost over my head, in all my trials I have believed that God would comfort me, in my darkest time I continue to have faith in God knowing that he is my best friend, and I believe I shall be saved.
        Last night while conversing with a christian friend on the subject of religion, the Lord comforted me, my soul was happy, I felt lifted above this poor world, my sorrow is gone, my trouble has left me, and now my soul is happy, bless the Lord oh! my soul, hallelujah, praise and honor and glory be to my saviour! Jesus Christ!
        The Lord does not suffer his children to be in darkness always no but he will always in his own good time give joy, peace and comfort to do the will of God, and be resigned to suffering, trials and temptations we need much help from God.

        We heard last Saturday night that our Son in law, Mr. Williamson was wounded, we feel uneasy, we did not hear where Willie was but hope that he is with his Sister. I feel cast down today, my way seems hedged up with trials and temptations, this is a wilderness of sin and trouble. Oh 'tis a good thought to think of our home in Heaven, where we shall meet with those we love, to part no more.

        This is my birth day, I am 42 years old today. I have been blessed from my infancy to the present time, goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life. I have had great religious privileges, and every blessing to enjoy. I feel happy today, I will praise the Lord, he converted my soul when I was sixteen years old. I had a pious Father and a good education.
