November 9th
        I am sorely tempted. I am passing through a great trial. I know that God's grace is sufficient for me, I will look to him to deliver me, my trials are great but Christ is a great Saviour. Oh my Heavenly Father, I pray thee to comfort my troubled soul.

        I feel some better today. I know that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and I will continue to look to him and call on him to deliver me out of my temptations and great trials. There is nothing too hard for the Lord.

        I felt sad last night, I got up out my bed and wrestled in prayer with God to help me. This text of scripture flashed into my mind "And shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him I tell you that he will avenge them speedily," so I shall hold on to that promise and wait on God for deliverance.

        I feel somewhat comforted today. I have faith in God, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord which made Heaven and Earth." "Bless the Lord Oh! my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name." For the Lord God is a sun and shield, he will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. I thank God for the hope which I have of eternal life, my soul shall make her boast in the Lord.

        My husband started to the army yesterday for Goldsboro, he will get back to Court on a furlough. May the Lord make this trial work out for his spiritual good. I continue to look to God, I do trust in him, but I am tempted and tryed.
        I went to Union today to prayer meeting, it was public fast day. We had a profitable time at Church, good deal of feeling. Read the Bible and exhorted, we sung several hymns. I have received comfort this evening my trouble is gone, my soul is happy, hallelujah. I will praise the Lord forever, he has answered me.
