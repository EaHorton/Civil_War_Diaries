Saturday, Feb'y 1st/62--
        A week since I wrote, and now only to record a most astonishing event, Mr. Green spent the day with us, Mr. Robert Green; this morning Mother, Aunt Mary and I were sitting talking together when one of the
children ran in calling out Captain Green is come! we knew that he was in Vicksburg, for last night Father came out and asked us to guess who was in Vicksburg. I soon thought of Mr. Green, but thought it was absurd to guess him; we were all very glad to see him, he was as usual, perfectly agreeable, left soon after dinner as he was riding Father's mule, and must get in before dark, says he hopes to come back and see us again.--
        I have been so busy enjoying myself for the past week that I have had no time for writing. Uncle David, Aunt Mary, Grandma and Hun and Kitty arrived last Saturday night, there has been no school this week, it has been so long since we have seen any of them that we could not do anything but enjoy their presence. The children have been in a perfect glee, have made noise enough to deafen me.
        Willie has had the chills again this week, I feel so sorry for him.
