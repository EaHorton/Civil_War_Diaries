        Sister Ann has been to see me, I do desire to see her enjoy religion. Dr. Thaxton brought all his children to see me last week, we had a happy time together, may the Lord bless them abundantly. I love my sister's children, Billy, Mary Alice, Pheriba, George, Sally Green have professed religion this last summer.

        I have just received a letter from my dear George, he was well and doing well. I also heard from Mary Virginia and Willie, they were both well, she has another daughter. Oh! how thankful and happy I feel, what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits, to hear such good news from my children who are far away.
        I have just received a letter from my daughter written 29th of October, she was well, also the children.
