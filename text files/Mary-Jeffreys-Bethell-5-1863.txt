Sunday 3rd of May
        Mr. Bethell has gone to Lickfork today, I feel lonesome. I feel sick, have not been well for two weeks, I have constipated bowels, my little Ann is sick today, been vomiting, she had Scarlet fever this winter and looks delicate, we had 4 cases of Scarlet fever, Dick, Elick and Silvy. Our servant Bill is declining, has been sick ever since Christmas. Mr. Williamson's servants are improving, they all had chills. I feel sad today, but I will continue to look to my Saviour and I expect to be comforted. I am entirely cut off from my daughter in Arkansa, my son Willy is there, but I believe my God will take care of them.

        Our servant boy Bill died last Tuesday, was sick near five months. I felt very bad after he died, I could not sleep well for two nights. I have not been well for two or three weeks, my bowels have been constipated. I have been low spirited, my faith was surrounded by darkness, the Lord's face hid from me, had no comfort, felt like I was a poor helpless sinner, who deserved nothing, but I prayed unto the Lord to comfort my poor troubled soul. I have read my bible and found some comfort, and I do trust in the Lord, my health is better today. I have had trials and temptation, had evil thoughts, if the Lord were to mark iniquity who should stand, if it was not for Jesus Christ death and intercession I would have been in torment long ago. I have been led to see how poor, helpless, sinful and miserable I am, without Christ I am nothing, but he is all in all, we are worms of the dust, but to have all our sins washed away by the precious blood of Jesus Christ and have grace to help in our time of need is a joy unspeakable.

        I feel better today, my health has improved, and I trust in Christ. I have some comfort. Oh for the renewing influence of the Holy spirit. I want more faith, more love, to serve my Saviour.
        I went to see Sister Robertson yesterday, her son Willy is very low with pneumonia.
