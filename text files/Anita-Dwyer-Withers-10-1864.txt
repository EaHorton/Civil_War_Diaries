Oct. 5th. [1864]
        They some fighting near Richmond about the 4th. & 5th. My Husband has gotten uneasy and determined to send me away again. Cousin John Brodnax has kindly invited me to his house in N. Carolina.
        I concluded to send for Dr. Hughes, he prescribed for me. I was right in thinking I was more delicate than my friends imagined.
        I started to Danville on the 12th. Oct.--exactly six months before I started for Meckenlenburg Co. I was very much opposed to leaving Richmond or rather my Husband, but he thought it the wisest course to pursue.
        I remained in Danville only a week. Col. Withers family were all
exceedingly kind to me--I was there when they moved to the bank--
        I started for Cousin John's on the 20th. October--I have been here ten today--I am very much pleased, I like the household very much-- Cousin Bettie is one of the sweetest women I ever saw. I have two servants here, Susan and Mary--
        Mary was taken sick on Sunday 6th so I concluded it was a good time to wean Johnnie. I made Easter, one of the servants here, stay in my room at night. I had not had near as much trouble as I anticipated. Johnny cries for me nearly all the time.
