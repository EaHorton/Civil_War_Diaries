absent, he is very proud of him.
        The children went to a little party at Mrs. Dawson's yesterday, and returned in high spirits.
        Our little school goes on quite well still, I do do wish to help the children, both mentally and spiritually, that sometimes I fear my
very anxiety makes me too strict, and injures instead of improves them. My chief wish in life is to see all mu family truly happy, though I am afraid I do not always set a consistent example, but my indolence and selfishness retards the work I would accomplish.
        As for myself, I find my heart so full of sinful feelings that I am ready to say "I am the chief of sinners" and I often fear that I shall never find that perfect peace that the bible promises; but I must keep on trying, and if I do the bible promises I shall at last succeed.--

        It has been raining steadily since yesterday morning, drip, drip, drip without a moment's intermission, and it seems as if it will continue all day, Willie just arrived in time. My boil burst last night, and does not pain me at all this morning. I hope I shall soon be able to wear my dress again. It is now nine o'clock, and I must go to school.
