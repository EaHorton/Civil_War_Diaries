December 12
        I feel thankful tonight to the Lord, he has delivered me out of this temptation, he has taken trouble off my heart, he hears and answers my prayers, I have peace and comfort, I will love and praise God for his great goodness to me and mine. My soul is happy, glory and honor to his name. It is my daily prayer that God would convert my dear George, also Mr. Williamson, they are at Johnson's Island, prisoners of war. I hope they will come home with new hearts. I feel more humble, God has shown me how weak and vile I am. I deserve nothing. I have been short of my duty. I can say "The Lord my righteousness."
Dec. 21
        I have had a trying time for many days, so many cares on my mind. It was a time of heaviness and manifold temptations. The Lord's face was hid, I saw how weak and vile I was in my own eyes, poor worm of the dust. I felt like I was in the wilderness tempted by the devil, about midnight I got out of my bed and got on my knees to pray to the Lord for comfort, help and direction. I received a little comfort. I felt like I was safe and secure in Christ, it is a comfortable feeling to feel like we lean on the bosom of Christ and rest in his arms.
