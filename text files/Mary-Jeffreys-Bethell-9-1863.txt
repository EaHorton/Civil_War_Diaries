September 16th 1863
        We have heard that our dear George was taken prisoner and carried to Johnson's island, which is on Lake Erie in the state of Ohio. I thank the Lord 'tis no worse. I hope the Lord will watch over him, bless him and bring him back to his home and Parents.
        We heard that our daughter and her husband Mr. Williamson were taken prisoners, but we will still look to God and beg him to save them. If I know my heart, I do love God with all my heart, soul, mind and strength, and have the witness of the spirit, with it I am the child of God. I feel that I am on my way to my home in Heaven, hallalujia! Praise ye the Lord!
        I have been to see Mrs. Watson, a poor widow lady, her husband died in the army. I tryed to comfort her.
        I went to see Sophia and Bettie De Jarnette, poor orphan girls, I pray that God may bless and take care of them. I shall try and visit Mrs. Mitchell a poor widow-lady, her daughter died a few days ago, she is afflicted. May the Lord help and bless all the poor of my neighborhood. I feel more resigned to God's will than I ever did, and I want to do his will.
        I have been to see poor old Mrs. Mitchell, she was sad, she has lost her youngest child. I tryed to comfort her, she seemed grateful for my visit.
