January 3rd 1863
        By the goodness of my Heavenly Father I am spared to see another year. The health of my whole family has been good, the Lord has blessed us abundantly, my two sons in the army have enjoyed good health. The Lord has wonderfully preserved them from death, thanks and praise to his holy name, for he is good to me and mine. I now renew my covenant with God. I am still trying to serve God, I delight in reading my precious Bible, it is a great comfort to me in time of trouble, the promises are so encouraging, I feel that I am growing in grace, I do enjoy religion. I have a peace that flows like a river, thank God for the great things he has done for me, and mine. I do believe that he will bless my children, my faith in God is strengthened. I have temptations, trials and sorrows, but he gives me supporting grace, in every temptation he makes a way for my escape.

        This is the first Sabbath day in the new year. I feel happy today in thinking over the goodness of God in giving us his son Jesus Christ to die for us. Oh! what a precious Saviour he is to all those who believe in him.
        I had the pleasure yesterday of talking to a person about their soul, I hope that God will bless my effort and save their soul. I have not heard from Willie since he got to Arkansa, I would be so glad to hear from my dear daughter, I hope the Lord will enable her to get here safe with her husband and children.
        I have not heard from my dear George in several weeks, but I commit my dear absent son into God's hands.

        We received a letter from our dear George, he was well, thanks be to God.
        I heard yesterday the death of Robert Watt, only son of cousin Bob Watt. Oh! what a loud call to his Mother to be a christian. I feel like I am on my way to Heaven.
