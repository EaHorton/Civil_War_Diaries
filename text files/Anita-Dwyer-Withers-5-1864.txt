        We went to Church although it was raining. Father Huber preached about the blessed Virgin.
        The President's child will be buried this evening.
May 12th. Thursday. [1864]
        I left Richmond for Mecklenburg with Mr. R. Russell. I did not intend going to the country until June, but the great excitement in Richmond, and my being sick, determined my Husband to send me sooner.
        Mrs. Nelson left the day before for Dr. Wayt's, who was ill and gone deranged.
        Gen. Lee's Army had been fighting Grant's for about a week before I left, and is still fighting I believe.
        The Yankees attempted to advance on R--by different directions. Beauregard whipped them or checked them near Drery Bluff--
        Poor Gen. J. E. B. Stuart was wounded on the 11th. and died on the 12th May. I feel so much for his poor wife.
May 21st. [1864]
        I have been at Mrs. Russell's for about ten days. I like it very much, they are all very kind to me. It is a sweet place--beautiful scenery
all around. I have not heard from the Capt. but once since I came.
        Johnny is getting along finely, I put short clothes on him on the 10th. May--he did not take any cold from it.
