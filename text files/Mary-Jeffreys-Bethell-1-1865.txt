January 7th 1865
        The Lord has spared me to see the beginning of another year. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."
        I will now renew my covenant with God, if he will continue to bless me and mine I will serve him as long as I live. I now give myself and all I have to the Lord, let him do as seemeth unto him good with me and mine. I pray that I may be enabled to do his will, and I pray that I may suffer with meekness and patience all that the Lord permits to come upon me, for I know that "All things shall work together for good to those that love God."
        I do not regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord hears and answers my prayers, I have faith in God. Oh! Lord sanctify me through thy truth for thy word is truth. I feel my unprofitableness, I desire to be filled with all the fullness of God.

        Yesterday Mary Virginia and myself agreed to fast and pray to God to bless George and Mr. Williamson and convert their souls, and bring them safely home. I feel much better since I fasted. I now enjoy religion I can see my way clear. I have peace and comfort in believing in our Saviour Jesus Christ, bless the Lord Oh my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name. I shall wait on the Lord, and look to him to bring my dear George and Weldon home soon.
