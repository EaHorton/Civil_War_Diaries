        My dear George is at home, come to stay a few days, he is in fine health. Willy is at home too, well and hearty. I am so thankful to God for his goodness, my soul is happy in the Lord. We have received a letter from our dear daughter at last, thank the Lord, she was tolerable well, her husband and children well, as usual, they were at their home, the Yankees had not molested them. I was so glad to hear from them, Mr. Bethell speaks of going after our daughter and bring[ing] her to North Carolina. I hope and pray that it may come to pass, last Monday and Tuesday I was cast down, many cares and perplexities, doubts, and fears, no comfort, no peace, but I prayed constantly to the Lord to remove my troubles, he answered my prayer, and now for several days I have peace and comfort in the Lord. On Thursday night my soul was happy, I told my husband how happy I was, felt that Jesus was my Saviour, and that I was on my way to heaven. I will trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehova is everlasting strength.

        My dear George left me last Monday, I felt very sad after I left him. I have been sick several days, depressed and cast down. I feel that this is the vale of tears, no lasting peace in this world, sin and sorrow wound my soul. Jesus thy balm can make it whole.
