April 1864
        It has been some time since I wrote in my diary, owing to the scarcity of writing paper.
        My dear Willie started to the army two weeks ago, he left the 7th of this month to join Gen. Lee's army near Orange C. House, it was a trial to me, but I committed him into the hands of my Saviour. God is my refuge in every trouble. I pray that his life may be preserved.
        I have not heard from George and Mr. Williamson since Feb they were well. We are looking for them home as there will be an exchange of prisoners. I thank the Lord for his goodness to my dear sons in the army.
        My dear daughter has professed religion, speaks of joining the Episcopal church, I am sorry, it grieves me to think of it. I would be glad for her to be with me and join the Methodists, but I pray that the Lord's will may be done.
        The Lord permits me to pass through many trials, I hope that I am growing in grace. I intend to labor for my Lord and Master.
