16 January 1865
        We passed a sad Xmas, last year my dear William spent 10 days with us, & I felt all the time that those hours were before me, his affectionate greeting of us, the loving kind tones of his voice, his fine manly form, & expressive face, were ever in my mind, & I mourned for my lost son. - We had many mercies, we were well, & the family at home enjoyed a bountiful repast, on Xmas day and on New Years day. The winter has been a very cold one, but we have had a home & food. This
day Elizabeth left us to be assistant teacher in Miss Read's School in Unionville. Miss Kenedy has been very kind in interesting herself about this plan of Elizabeth's, & went down with her to day , to see the school begin, E is to teach French & Music. - This dear child has been the comfort and help of her parents, and family, she has taught her sisters, & Harry, and benefitted them in every way. Lotty, owing to her care & instruction is well educated, & Harry has been most unwillingly instructed, in French, and in every way elevated, & improved. - She must be followed, wherever she goes, with a blessing; a dutiful, & Christian child. Miss Read is keeping house, & we hope E will find it pleasant there. -
       The war goes on and things look gloomy but I have an abiding faith in the success of the Cause. -
