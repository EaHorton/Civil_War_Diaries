June 28th
        Since I last wrote we have had a death in our family. Mollie Weldon, my little grandaughter died on the 2nd of June, her bowels and lungs were diseased, she was about 9 months old, a bright and lovely babe, one of the sweetest buds of promise. We miss her, but we have another angel in Heaven to praise God, our blessed Saviour. May the Lord help us all to meet Mollie Weldon in Heaven.
        Last Sunday was my birth day, I was 43 years old, and now as I enter my 44 year I will renew my covenant with God. I now consecrate myself and all that I have to his service. I am the Lord's and he is my Saviour. I will love and serve him as long as I live, hope to praise him in Heaven.
