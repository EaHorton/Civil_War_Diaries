        Last Saturday and Sunday was our meeting at Union, on Sunday we commemorated the death and suffering of our Saviour by partaking of the Holy sacrament. I did enjoy it and the Lord blessed me, soul and body, my soul was refreshed, 'twas a comfort to me. Brother Gannon preached for us, he came home with us and spent the night, he is our minister, may the Lord bless him abundantly. My health is good now, thank the Lord. I will praise the Lord for his goodness to me, my children all tolerable well.
